A blog and Bin Laden

People will rightly point out that the tech blogosphere [was robust well before 9/11](http://scripting.com/toc.html). But I think it is valid to assert that the non-tech blogosphere’s coming of age was really 9/11. Many of the prominent bloggers today ([Matt Yglesias](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/) and [Megan McArdle](http://www.theatlantic.com/megan-mcardle/) for example) come out of the “warblogger” milieu of that period (whether pro or anti “warblogger”). Myself, I began blogging a few weeks before Chris at *Tapped* on a pre-GNXP weblog I had for all of two months, from April to May of 2002. At that point my concerns were Java Server Pages, the War on Terror, and genetic engineering (in particular the anti-genetic engineering arguments of Francis Fukuyama and Bill McKibben). 9/11 had perturbed me from my general isolationist orientation, but over the years I’ve shifted back to my old equilibrium.

Below is a Google Trends result restricted to the USA for the terms blog, magazine, and newspaper.
