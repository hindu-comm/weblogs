Less fear of the flu for asthmatics?

One of the reasons I tend toward a bit of hypochondria is probably the fact that what for others are inconvenient minor ailments often trigger my asthma. So nice to see this, [Why Does Flu Trigger Asthma?](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110529184039.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher):

For various reasons I’m moderately skeptical of incremental improvements in life expectancy in developed nations through drugs. But, I do think there are plenty of possibilities when it comes to reducing [morbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease#Morbidity), and therefore increasing productivity of a life well lived.
