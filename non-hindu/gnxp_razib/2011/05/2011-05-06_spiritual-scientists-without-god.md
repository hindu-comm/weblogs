Spiritual scientists without God

I’ve mentioned Elaine Ecklund’s research before on ‘[spiritual atheists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/04/scientists-as-spiritual-atheists/).’ Though I had a hard time understanding the thrust of her conclusions or inferences on occasion I could grapple with her raw quantitative results. But now she has a long paper out in *Sociology of Religion*, [Scientists and Spirituality](http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/16/socrel.srr003.full), which is based on long qualitative interviews. It is open access so you should be able to read the whole thing. Honestly I have a hard time figuring out if this is all a big semantic confusion. I’m curious if you can extract something interesting. Here’s the abstract:

> We ask how scientists understand spirituality and its relation to > religion and to science. Analyses are based on in-depth interviews > with 275 natural and social scientists at 21 top U.S. research > universities who were part of the Religion among Academic Scientists > survey. We find that this subset of scientists have several distinct > conceptual or categorical strategies for framing the connection > spirituality has with science. Such distinct framings are instantiated > in spiritual beliefs more congruent with science than religion, as > manifested in the possibility of “spiritual atheism,” those who see > themselves as spiritual yet do not believe in God or a god. > **Scientists stress a pursuit of truth that is individualized (but not > characterized by therapeutic aims) as well as voluntary engagement > both inside and outside the university.** Results add complexity to > existing thinking about spirituality in contemporary American life, > indicating that conceptions of spirituality may be bundled with > characteristics of particular master identity statuses such as > occupational groups. Such understandings also enrich and inform > existing theories of religious change, particularly those related to > secularization.
