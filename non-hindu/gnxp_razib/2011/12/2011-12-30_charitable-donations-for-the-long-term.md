Charitable donations for the long term

My friend [Holden Karnofsky](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/hedge-fund-analytics-for-nonprofits-11232011.html) always pings me at this time of the year. Holden is co-founder of [GiveWell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell). If you’re curious, you can look up more on the outfit yourself, I’ve talked about it enough over the years for you to get why I’m interested and a supporter. Holden is a numbers and data driven guy, and it turns out that [25% of the money given through their website](http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/30/last-minute-donations/) last year was on December 31st. Here are their [top charities](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).

In purely selfish news (yes, I’m a heavy user) [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/L11_1227_EMR_JW/en/US?uselang=en&utm_campaign=20111230EM3.en.US&utm_medium=email&utm_source=email3.USD.20) is also in need of cash. And yes, I give! (though that doesn’t stop the constant stream of begging headshots)
