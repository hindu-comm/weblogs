Noninvasive tests for Down Syndrome

I’ve mentioned this before, but I thought I’d pass on the [latest report on MaterniT21](http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/sequenom-publish-validation-study-t13-and-t18-dx-plans-improvements-lower-matern), the prenatal noninvasive Down Syndrome test. Currently it has a \$235 copay for women with insurance. As of now only a few percent of the \~5 million pregnancies in the USA are subject to amnio or [c.v.s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling) This procedure may result in the screened proportion going from \~1 percent to \~50 or more percent (though the firm that is providing this can only process \~100,000 tests per year as of now). I stumbled upon this after doing a follow up on my post, [Would you have your fetus genetically tested?](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/12/would-you-have-your-fetus-genetically-tested/) Interestingly the proportions who would get tested doesn’t differ that much between demographics.

And the outcomes can sometimes surprise. A [story in the Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/12/04/a-chosen-child.html) relates the story of a couple who kept their daughter, who tested positive for Down Syndrome. **They had originally decided that if the tests came back positive the would terminate.** In contrast, the nurses relate that one strongly anti-abortion couple at the beginning of the process seems to have terminated. Right now 1 in 700 pregnancies result in Down Syndrome.
