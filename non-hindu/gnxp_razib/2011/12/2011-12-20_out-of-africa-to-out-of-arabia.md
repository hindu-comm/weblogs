Out of Africa to Out of Arabia

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/12/black-t-shirt.jpg?resize=300%2C243)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/12/black-t-shirt.jpg?resize=300%2C243)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2011/12/black-t-shirt.jpg)[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2011/12/2012-looking-good-for-my-predictions.html) and [Greg Cochran](http://westhunt.wordpress.com/) have been talking about this possibility for a few years. But a combination of archaeological finds and the current unsettled nature of the human evolutionary genomics literature means that “Out of Arabia” is a real possibility (not laugh-out-loud crazy and weird). So I took the liberty of cooking up a new design for the [RichardDawkins.net](http://store.richarddawkins.net/products/we-are-all-africans) website. Science is about updating our prior assumptions, so it shouldn’t be too much of an issue. What I wonder: **how would the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia feel about replacing Ethiopia and Kenya in human evolution documentaries?** **Addendum:** To be clear, this isn’t to say I accept “Out of Arabia” for the origin of most modern humans, including within Africa. Rather, I think it’s not a crazy idea anymore, especially in light of the weird results which imply that West Africans may be genetically closer to non-Africans than to Pygmies and San (and it would make more sense of older uniparental results which imply back-migration from Eurasia into Africa).
