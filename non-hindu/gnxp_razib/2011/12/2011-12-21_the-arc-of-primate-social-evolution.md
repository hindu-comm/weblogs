The arc of primate social evolution

A new paper in [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10601.html), [Stepwise evolution of stable sociality in primates](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/nature10601.html), was written up in *The New York Times* with the provocative title, [Genes Play Major Role in Primate Social Behavior, Study Finds](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/science/genes-play-major-role-in-primate-social-behavior-study-finds.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print). As noted in Joan Silk’s [article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/full/479182a.html) on the paper it should really be *phylogenetics play major role in primate social behavior*. The model outlined in the paper indicates that phylogenetic relationships between major primate clades is a much better predictor of social organization and structure than simple adaptation to a specific environment, or a linear increase in social organization (group size) over time. Both of these latter dynamics **would also be driven by genetic changes, and therefore tie “genes” to social behavior.** In other words, genes always matter, it’s just how they matter that differs. Here’s the section of the abstract of the paper of major interest:

> … Here we present a model of primate social evolution, whereby > sociality progresses from solitary foraging individuals directly to > large multi-male/multi-female aggregations (approximately 52 million > years (Myr) ago), with pair-living (approximately 16 Myr ago) or > single-male harem systems (approximately 16 Myr ago) derivative from > this second stage. This model fits the data significantly better than > the two widely accepted alternatives (an unstructured model implied by > the socioecological hypothesis or a model that allows linear stepwise > changes in social complexity through time). We also find strong support for the co-evolution of social living with a change from nocturnal to diurnal activity patterns, but not with sex-biased dispersal….

I read the “letter,” but the reality is that this is one of those papers where you have to read the [supplements](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7372/extref/nature10601-s1.pdf) to get a real sense of what is going on. I haven’t as of this moment, though I invite readers to browse through them and get back with their own assessment of the model. Broadly, I don’t object to the inference generated here…but I do wonder if the transition between the human-chimp ancestor and later hominins is to some extent *sui generis*. I have suggested that modern humans were “inevitable” after \~2 million years before the present, but I don’t think there was anything inevitable before that period. The overall point of the paper is that history and contingency matter a great deal, which to me implies that we should be cautious about making specific judgments of positions along the phylogenetic tree derived from what we gather from the whole….
