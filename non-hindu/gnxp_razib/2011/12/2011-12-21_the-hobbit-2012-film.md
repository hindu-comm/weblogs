The Hobbit (2012 film)

My working assumption is that this will be a regression back to the mean in relation to Peter Jacksonâ€™s [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy) trilogy. I notice is that the projected budget for the two films is already more than a time and a half greater than all three of those earlier releases. Even accounting for inflation I suspect this is just a function of the resources now available to Jackson.

Though I assume it will at least supersede the 1977 Rankin-Bass production of the Hobbit (often [parodied on South Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBJ3rkNq2ok&feature=related)):
