The evolutionary necessity of lying

John Horgan has a [long review](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/books/review/the-folly-of-fools-by-robert-trivers-book-review.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print) of Robert Trivers’ long overdue book, [The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465027555/geneexpressio-20). I really don’t care how well Trivers analyzed the topic, this is such a rich and important issue that I can’t help but think he must have hit some important mines of insight. I haven’t read [The Folly of Fools](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465027555/geneexpressio-20), but I can recommend [Natural Selection and Social Theory: Selected Papers of Robert Trivers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195130626/geneexpressio-20). It’s not just a compilation of papers, there are biographical chapters which flesh out the context behind a particular idea at a given time. Trivers also shows up prominently in [Defenders of the Truth: The Sociobiology Debate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192862154/geneexpressio-20) and [Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345408934/geneexpressio-20).
