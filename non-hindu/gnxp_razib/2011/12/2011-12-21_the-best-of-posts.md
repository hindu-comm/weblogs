The "best of" posts….

Sam Snyder has gone through my archives back to 2006, and complied a [“best of”](http://samsnyder.com/2011/12/02/the-best-of-gnxp/) list. Snyder admits that his interest is in “primarily centered on human behavior and health, which is the subject of most of these links.” Also, I want to caution you that **5 years is a *long time*, so please don’t assume that if I believe X in 2006, I continue to do so in 2011.**
