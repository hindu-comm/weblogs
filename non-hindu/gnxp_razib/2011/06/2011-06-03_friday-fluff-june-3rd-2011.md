Friday Fluff – June 3rd, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) I haven’t been feeling very well the last few days, and don’t have the energy or interest to go trolling through my archives. So I recommend you read Steve Brenner’s [Does Arsenic Really Exist in the DNA from GFAJ-1?](http://www.ffame.org/ATemptingScience/?p=41)

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “‘julian o’dea’ grave?” Julie O’Dea is a reader of this weblog of long standing. Perhaps there’s a famous Julian O’Dea? I have no idea. I do know that there are people who are being “stalked” by others who read this weblog, because if they leave their names in the comments that comes up high in search queries. It’s pretty creepy sometimes to see others being stalked. Somehow it’s more disturbing than the search queries for my own name (I’m kind of stingy with my biographical data in some ways so the queries of the form “where does Razib live?” or “Razib married children” kind of make sense to me, even if they’re implicitly unwelcome).

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“Hold the praise (re: comments)”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/06/hold-the-praise-re-comments/#comment-73912):

> This was a great post. Very informative! By the way have you seen my collection of genuine high end watches? I’m selling them cheap because I lost a lot of money in the financial crisis and have loans to pay off….

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
