No bookstores in Nashville?

That’s what [Ann Patchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Patchett) is [claiming](http://thephoenix.com/boston/arts/121442-ann-patchett-finds-her-readers/?page=1#TOPCONTENT). More specifically, there are no bricks & mortar institutions which specialize in selling new books. There *are* places you can get used books in the city of Nashville. To remedy the situation Patchett is opening up a bookstore herself. She asserts that “…we’ve got to get back to a 3000-square-foot store and not 30,000. Amazon is always going to have everything – you can’t compete with that. But there is, I believe, still a place for a store where people read books.”

I recall going to a Barnes & Noble when I was in Nashville in the summer of 2004. Here’s some demographic [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville-Davidson_(balance),_Tennessee): “As of the 2010 census, the balance population was 601,222. The 2000 population was 545,524.” The details here are a bit muddy because parts of Davidson county are included with the Nashville total, but you get a general sense of how substantial the population of this city is. As a point of comparison Eugene, OR, has a population of [156,185](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon), and [29 Yelp hits](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bookstores&ns=1&find_loc=eugene%2C+or#cflt=bookstores&l=p:OR:Eugene::) for bookstores. Nashville has [46 results](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bookstores&ns=1&find_loc=eugene%2C+or#cflt=bookstores&find_loc=Nashville,+TN).

Back to Patchett’s claim, I think there is something there. I don’t know how it’s going to shake out in the details. But consider the fact that it is far cheaper to brew your own coffee at home, but more and more people are frequenting shops which sell coffee at a much higher per unit cost. Obviously people are going for the *experience*. The main issue with bookstores is that the per unit cost of a book is higher than even a fancy drink at most coffee shops.
