Friday Fluff – June 24th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) **Post from the past:** [The wisdom of Seinfeld](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002438.html). How far in the past? When I wrote this it was closer to the series finale of Seinfeld than to now!

  
2) **Weird search query of the week**: “economics of having children marketplace.” I think I might have mentioned some of Murray Rothbard’s strange ideas on this at some point….

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [“Cave of Forgotten Dreams, see it, but tune the narration out”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/06/cave-of-forgotten-dreams-see-it-but-tune-the-narration-out/#comments):

> Razib,  
> You are not the first person to misspell his first name “Werner” in > that manner, many do it with purpose to undercut the man and discredit his films (though I assume you would argue a minor overlook and/or simple mistake). His films continue to command viewing decades after their making and his legend grows with that. >
> Is it a perfect film? -No.  
> Is it an essential film? – Absolutely.  
> Was the scientific element that you vented about present? -Yes  
> If there was more scientific informations would we have missed out on the humanity of it? -Yes >
> “Humaness” as it was put in the film has much a place in the culture > of man as the sciences of explanation. This was easily the best film > to date of 2011, and the best film period I have seen in 3 years. > Regardless of whether these Chauvet caves are ever filmed again or > not, people in 100 years will still know of this film. Our > grandchildren’s grandchildren who will not even know our names from > their family trees will have access to this film when the Hangover > Part II’s and the other films like it that are worthless in the > “Humaness” sense will be forgotten in even the footnotes of history. > Like it or not, Werner’s annoying commentary (annoying to you Razib) > has just become the official voice of authority on the Chauvet Cave of our generation to all the generations of the world to come. He may not be Jean-Marie Chauvet or his colleagues, but unto future generations he will be like unto Howard Carter, Gertrude Bell and even Hemingway.

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
