Heritability and genomics of facial characteristics

On several occasions I’ve gotten into discussions with geneticists about the possibility of reconstructing someone’s facial structure by genes alone. Combined with advances in pigmentation prediction by genetics, this could put the sketch artist out of business! But all that begs the question: **how heritable are facial features anyhow?** Impressionistically we know that feature are broadly heritable. This isn’t a tenuous supposition, you see the resemblance over and over across families. All that being said, what are the specific quantitative heritability estimates? How do they relate to other traits we’re interested in? This review from the early 1990s seems to have what I’m looking for, [The Role of Genetics in Craniofacial Morphology and Growth](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.an.20.100191.001401). Below is a table which shows averaged heritabilities for a range of facial quantitative traits from a large number of studies:

h² is the narrow-sense heritability. Also, in care you are curious [cephalometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry) seems to be utilizing imaging of some sort. Anthropmetry refers to the more conventional measuring techniques (get out the calipers!). These results suggest that facial features are typically more heritable than behavioral traits (usually \< 0.50), but less heritable than height (0.8-0.9). This seems plausible to me.

These results came to my attention because of a paper in the *European Journal of Human Genetics*, [Genetic determination of human facial morphology: links between cleft-lips and normal variation](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ejhg2011110a.html):

The authors get to the point at the very end of the discussion:

In other words, the genetic architecture of the traits which govern facial features are going to be more like height than pigmentation. That means forensic facial reconstruction will be a way off in the distance. But how far in the distance? A friend pointed out recently if that full genome sequences were ever associated with Facebook profiles that might be a data miner’s dream come true. The *way* is already out there, the key is the *will*, ethical and computational.
