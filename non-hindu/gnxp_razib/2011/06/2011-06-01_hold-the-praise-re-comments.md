Hold the praise (re: comments)

So over the past few months there has been an issue where manual comment spam is getting more sophisticated. The strategy is to leave an anodyne comment with really vague references to how the post is “great” and “very informative” or something like that. The English would usually pass a grammar check, but there’s a strangeness that suggests to me that the commenter isn’t a native speaker, and quite often they link back to some spam site. Obviously I don’t post these and tag them as spam, but it’s kind of becoming harder & harder to avoid false positives while also keeping a check on false negatives.

What I’m asking is that **if you want to leave a short comment to the effect of “thanks, great post!”, please think twice.** The spammers have ruined this sort of polite and human interaction at this point, as I’m often suspicious now that someone who *is* expressing heartfelt praise is trying to get me to approve the comment so that they can get a little PageRank.I’m prompted to put this post up mostly because I’ve had some “near misses” where I assumed that an individual was leaving comment spam, when they were just being a normal decent human being.

Here’s what you can do as an alternative:

– Share my post on twitter, Facebook, Digg, etc.

– Or, you can send me a direct message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/razibkhan99)

– And of course, you can go old school and email me at contactgnxp -at- gmail -dot- com. I get a fair amount of appreciative emails, and if you take the time out to write something nice that’s certainly a *mitzvah*

Sorry for wasting your time with this. But I really need to head this off at the pass.
