The limits of the mean and the moderate

[Red States vs. Blue States: Going Beyond the Mean](http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/75/2/227):

Generating a statistical construct of the distribution of liberalism and conservatism on social and economic issues the authors produced a set of plots which illustrate the differences between “red” (conservative) states and “blue” (liberal) states. In the figures below the blue line represents “blue states/regions” while the red dashed lines represents “red states/regions.”

Let’s drill down to the level of two extreme cases: **New York state vs. Utah.**

How about looking at a more finer-grain? The congressional district level:

You see a bit more separation, as states are more moderate than the districts, but still a great deal of overlap. The author’s point is that despite our stylized conception of polarization and a great sorting of America there’s an incredible amount of overlap.

The authors conclude:

The institutional issue is straightforward: **in the United States we have a first-past-the-post single-district voting system, the person with the most votes in a locality always wins.** In most contexts even if you have less than 50% you win; there’s no runoff. This means small differences in the mean which are consistent are going to result in a repeated outcome for one faction, barring massive systematic nationwide shifts which change the whole playing field.

But I don’t think it’s *just* institutional. Certainly proportional representation voting systems don’t necessarily result in a plethora of moderate parties. On the contrary, they often allow for the emergence of coalitions of very specific sets of interests. In *theory* first-past-the-post tends to favor moderation insofar as candidates have to appeal to the “median voter.” I suspect part of what’s going on is that **it’s not too useful to think of the whole electorate as relevant.**

Using the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10),below are the results for vocabulary test scores (out of 10) for people of a given ideology who have attained a bachelor’s degree since 1972. I had to combine 0-4 because there really aren’t that many people who score that low who have at least a bachelor’s degree (this test has a [0.70 correlation with I.Q.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/)). The rows add up to 100% after the first column, so yo ucan see that 35.3 percent of self-described “extreme liberals” with at least a college degree obtained a 10 out of 10, while 11.6 percent of “moderates” did so.

A fixation on how *most people* mostly agree misses the fact that the most eloquent, motivated, and ideologically reflective are least likely to agree. Additionally, much of history has been dominated by motivated and mobilized collective action of a subset of the population. Ideologues on the Left and Right may be outnumbered in raw numbers, but it is totally useless to view society as a matter of pure individual mass action of the totality. The sum of the social parts if you will. Rather, there is a structure within society, nested sets of institutions. These units of political and social coherency tend to bubble up on the edges of the distribution, not the center. The firm and hard-edged margins easily dominate the discussion over the soft center. So it was, and so it will be.
