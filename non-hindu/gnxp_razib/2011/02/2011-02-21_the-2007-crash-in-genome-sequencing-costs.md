The 2007 crash in genome sequencing costs

[Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/illustrating-the-plummeting-cost-of-genome-sequencing/) suggests:

> Now, we don’t want everyone working in genomics to start using the > same blue-on-grey slide to illustrate the impending datapocalypse; so I’d encourage people to[download the raw data](http://www.genome.gov/pages/der/sequencing_cost.xls) (warning: Excel file) and make their own pretty pictures.

My straightforward attempts are below. Get the raw data and try your own. I assume that [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) could produce something prettier….
