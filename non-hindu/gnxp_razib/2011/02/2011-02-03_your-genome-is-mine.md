Your genome is mine! (?)

Guest blogging at [Genetic Future](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/got-to-give-it-up/) [Mischa Angrist](http://genomeboy.com/) has a [post up](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/got-to-give-it-up/) critiquing the defense of the lack of disclosure of genetic/genomic information to research participants. Mischa begins:

As a famous person once said, I am what I am. Knowing one’s raw sequence isn’t going to change the world. Most people are not going to brush up on on their scripting languages to try and interpret it. I’m not opposed to paternalism *per se*, but it needs to have some plausible basis, **and**, it needs to confront the *fait accompli* that cheap sequences are going to be reality within this decade.

This post should probably be in a link round up, but Mischa’s post is very good, and needs to be read. I am not as hopeful about the wisdom of the public as most, but, this sort of response is not grappling with the problems of free information realistically.
