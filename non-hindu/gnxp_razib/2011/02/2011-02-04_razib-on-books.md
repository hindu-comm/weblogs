Razib on Books

In the [New Year’s Open Thread](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/open-thread-january-1st-2011/#comment-56394) D. Chamberlin [suggested](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/01/open-thread-january-1st-2011/#comment-56394):

> I think your many book reviews ought to be more accessible. They were > for me an excellent guide as to which books I should buy as well as > educational in and of themselves. You have a long list of books you > reccommend over on Gene Expression Classic but clicking on them just > links you to the book seller. Just as a suggestion if you could link > to your previous book reviews that are buried in years gone by I think > many people would appreciate them as much as I did….

I have taken that to heart, and set up [a new website](http://razibkhanbooks.com/) where I am spending a little time each day adding links to a few book reviews which are “buried” in the posts of my various weblogs over the past 8 years. I’ve also added links & quick comments to books which I have never reviewed, but are part of my “cognitive furniture,” such as [Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](http://www.razib.com/books/2011/02/04/introduction-to-quantitative-genetics-genetics-and-analysis-of-quantitative-traits/).

The basic format is this: title, cover photo + link to Amazon, and then link to review or comment. That’s it. It’s not a “blog,” but rather a site devoted to organizing stuff I’ve already put out there. My current plan is to devote about 15-20 minutes per day to putting content on the site from my “back catalog.” When I post a review to this website, I’ll also automatically link to it from there. One thing to note is that over the years I’ve stopped reading popular books on science, and focused on the primary scientific literature more, so the “books” page will be loaded with my non-science interests.

I’ve hooked “posts” into my [total content feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed), but you can subscribe to its own [feed as well](http://www.razib.com/books/feed/) (I am also pushing the posts to my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/#!/razibkhan)).
