Friday Fluff – February 11th, 2011

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\) First, a **post from the past**: [Adaptation might not be a spherical cow](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/06/adaptation-might-not-be-a-spherical-cow/).

2) **Weird search query of the week**: “shemale escort bald.” I’m not making this up. The user who searched for this is a [Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna).

3\) **Comment of the week**, in response to [The neo-Malthusian petro-kings](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/02/the-neo-malthusian-petro-kings/#comment-57565):

> From what I remember, Ehrlich put far too much emphasis on shortages > of metals and minerals. Mineral shortages can be dealt with by > substitution, by more efficient use, by tech progress, or by > exploration. The questions with air, water, topsoil, and energy are > still with us. >
> A second problem is time scale. For whatever reason Ehrlich chose a > one-decade time frame. That’s an economist’s timeframe. Geophysical > and ecological events occur over centuries and millenia, so that there > can be long lags between cause and effect. There was a conference once > where economists and ecologists tried to work together on > environmental questions which dead-ended when it was found that for > the economists the long run was ten to twenty years, whereas for > ecologists the short run was a century. >
> Simon was a magical thinker. He argued once that since there are an > infinite number of points in a line, we can never run out of > resources. I had an argument once with a free-marketer who was > unwilling to concede that when the Atlantic cod fishery was destroyed, > that meant that that much less food was available. He argued that the > price system would take care of it somehow and that people would > substitute other products. For him no physical world existed, only > economies. (The cod fishery was a relatively minor source of food > quantitatively speaking, but I was building to the point that if, for > example, the Ukraine’s agricultural production diminished > significantly, there would be real effects on the world’s food > supply.)

4\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
