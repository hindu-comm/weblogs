Media me

I’ve been rather busy this week, so few posts. But, I did a Bloggingheads.tv with [Milford Wolpoff](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/34366). We talk Out of Africa, Multiregionalism, and such. Second, *The New York Times* [profiled](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/us/19beliefs.html?_r=2) [Secular Right](http://secularright.org), where I’m a contributor. The quotes were accurate, though I do find it amusing that the reporter refers to *me* as an apostate, but not John Derbyshire (who until \~5 years ago was a confessing Christian). I suspect that in this day and age the term “apostate” only has strong valence in relation to Islam. For the record, several ex-Muslims have disputed my apostasy, since I barely ever believed in the Islamic religion.
