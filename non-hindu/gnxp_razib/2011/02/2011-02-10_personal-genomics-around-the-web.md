Personal genomics around the web

Just some pointers. Dr. Daniel MacArthur has put up a [guest post](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/02/guest-post-by-razib-khan-my-personal-genome.php) where I outline my own experience with personal genomics. Cool times that we live in. Also, Zack Ajmal has started posting [higher K’s of HAP participants](http://www.harappadna.org/2011/02/admixture-k6-9-hrp0001-to-hrp0010/%20). He’s now in the [second batch](http://www.harappadna.org/2011/02/admixture-k-4-7-9-hrp0011-to-hrp0020/). My parents will be in the third. Lots of Tamils and Punjabis. The Khan’s are the only Bengalis so far. One individual to represent all of Uttar Pradesh. Here’s a [list of participants so far](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuW3R0Ys-P4HdGE4eDh6emt1dUs2U2pXTkVjS0lsV1E&hl=en#gid=0).

Finally, I know 3-D visualization is bad form, but I went for it anyway. Below is a cube which shows the positions of Gujaratis, Chinese, Mexican Americans, and Utah whites and Tuscans from the HapMap, along with a few extra samples from friends and family. Can you tell where my parents are?
