Friday Fluff – September 24th, 2010

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Historical Dynamics and contingent conditions of religion](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/historical-dynamics-and-contingent.php)

> I’ve been living in Sweden for somewhat more than a year now. I > previously lived in Canada, the USA, and Germany. From those > countries, the Swedes are at least in my impression the most backward > thinking nation I’ve encountered. Nowhere else have I heard so often > the replies “Because we’ve always done it like that.” or “That’s just > how we do it in Sweden,” when I inquired about the reason for a > particularly dumb procedure or policy. (An example: You won’t get a > contract for a phone unless you’ve paid taxes for at least 7 months. > WTF, I wonder, is that business of the phone company? And let me not > get started about the rental situation in that country, but hey, they’ve always done it like that.)

5\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
