Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

[Mike Castle trailing Christine O’Donnell in poll: What’s going on?](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0913/Mike-Castle-trailing-Christine-O-Donnell-in-poll-What-s-going-on) I remember O’Donnell from her numerous appearances on *Politically Incorrect* in the late 1990s. She seemed sweet, but kind of dull. The media reports make her out to be a sociopath though. [Here’s an old clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTYtu4lSqfU).

[George C. Williams, 83, Theorist on Evolution, Dies](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/14williams.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print). Nicholas Wade gets a lot of quotes.

  
[Through the Language Glass (Part 1)](https://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/09/through-language-glass-part-1.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingAnthropologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Anthropology)). Review of Guy Deutscher’s new book,[Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080508195X/geneexpressio-20/). Part 2 coming soon I assume.

[Turkish Reforms Pass by Wide Margin](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/world/europe/13turkey.html?hpw). I think the EU is a “Christian club.” As the Turks become more democratic their cultural distinctiveness will take on a more Islamic tinge, which Europeans won’t take kindly to. If the Turkish military somehow intervenes again, the Europeans will accuse them of being anti-democratic. They can’t win.

[Fiery Foods and Barbecue SuperSite](http://www.fiery-foods.com/). ‘nuf said.
