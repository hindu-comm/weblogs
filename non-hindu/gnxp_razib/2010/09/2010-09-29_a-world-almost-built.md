A world almost built

By now you’ve probably seen headlines such as [A Habitable Exoplanet — for Real This Time](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/09/real-habitable-exoplanet/). Phil Plait has a [more sober assessment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/29/possible-earthlike-planet-found-in-the-goldilocks-zone-of-a-nearby-star/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+BadAstronomyBlog+(Bad+Astronomy)). Still, he concludes:

> But perhaps the most interesting and exciting aspect of all this is > what it implies. The Milky Way galaxy is composed of about 200 billion > stars, and is 100,000 light years across. The fact that we found a > planet that is even anything like the Earth at all orbiting another > star only 20 light years away makes me*extremely* optimistic that > earthlike planets are*everywhere* in our galaxy. 20 light years is > practically in our lap compared to the vast size of our galaxy, so > statistically speaking, it seems very likely it’s not unique. I don’t > want to extrapolate from a data set of two (us and them), but if this > is typical, there could be millions of such planets in the > galaxy.*Millions*. >
> So we don’t know if this planet is all that much like Earth — the > surface gravity may be quite high if it’s dense and small, for > example, or it may not have any air, or it may have a thick atmosphere > like Venus — but what it’s telling us is that smaller, lower mass > planets at the right distance from their star for liquid water are > almost certainly common in the galaxy.

I assume this means we can play around with the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation)? In any case, I am now reminded of [Poul Anderson’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_anderson) essay “The creation of imaginary worlds: the world builder’s handbook and pocket companion.” You can read most of the essay online at [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=92TqYdj56TcC&lpg=PA105&ots=8bboeN1Dfh&dq=%22%22The%20Creation%20of%20Imaginary%20Worlds%3A%20The%20World%20Builder's%20Handbook%20and%20Pocket%20Companion%22%20anderson&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false). Or, find it in [Writing Science Fiction & Fantasy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312089260/geneexpressio-20). For us “squishy science” lovers the biochemist [Hal Clament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Clement) has an essay which follow’s Anderson’s which outlines how to create imaginary life.
