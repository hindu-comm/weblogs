Friday Fluff, September 10th, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

In the interests of “mixing it up” I’ve decided to try something different on Fridays (I’ve been blogging for eight years, but I’ll admit I haven’t been the most innovative of online content generators so far). I’m going to merge the cat pictures with other assorted potpourri. I envision regular features, so, for example, every week I’ll have a link to an old post worth revisiting.

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Breeding the breeder’s equation](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/05/breeding-the-breeders-equation/).

  
2. **Weird search query of the week**: “actresses with large foreheads.”

3\. **Comment of the week**:

> Mr,  
> Do you aware of you’ve been using a photo of the founder of Turkey?  
> And do you think this revilement will not be punished?  
> I would like to inform you the answar is “NO”. >
> razib khan or whatever, from pakistan, from a country that we’re helping for the flood disaster. is that your appreciation? Seems you’ve forgotten who’d deigned your lifes. >
> razib khan, I’m sincerely informing and underlining that will not be forgotten, also your name too. >
> If you like take it as a threat, because it is. >
> Turk.

4\) **Poll question**….

5\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
