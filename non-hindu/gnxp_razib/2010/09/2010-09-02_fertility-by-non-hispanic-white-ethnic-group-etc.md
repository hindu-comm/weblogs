Fertility by non-Hispanic white ethnic group, etc.

In my [post on American fertility rates by racial group](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/which-american-racial-group-has-the-lowest-fertility/) [Mike Keesey asks](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/09/which-american-racial-group-has-the-lowest-fertility/#comment-34072): ‘It’d also be interesting to see what’s going on within “non-Hispanic whites”.’ One can explore this question in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08). Let’s look at ancestry group (e.g., German, French, etc.), religion, belief in God, political ideology, intelligence and education, for non-Hispanic whites. The data is limited to the 2000s, and I also constrained to those age 45 and up. Then I looked at the “CHILDS” variable, which asks the respondent how many children they have. Taking the mean of this value gives us a sense of the rank order in fertility. **Note that this is not total fertility rate.** That should be clear from the values being well above 2 in most cases. Additionally, I recombined some categories, so that “British” is the amalgamation of English, Scottish and Welsh ancestry. The “Irish” class almost certainly includes both Scotch-Irish (doing the regional and religious breakdown this seems obvious), and the Irish without modifiers. For intelligence I used [“WORDSUM”](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/wordsum-iq/). The variables I input into the GSS can be found at the bottom of the post so you can replicate.

I believe much of the difference among white non-Hispanics by ancestry is caused by other variables. In particular, the low values for Italians is probably a function of their disproportionately urban residence patterns in comparison to German Americans. Other white ethnic groups (the sample sizes were smaller for these constraints) with a strong urban bias show the same pattern.
