Every variant with an author!

I recall projections in the early 2000s that 25% of the American population would be employed as systems administrators circa 2020 if rates of employment growth at that time were extrapolated. Obviously the projections weren’t taken too seriously, and the pieces were generally making fun of the idea that IT would reduce labor inputs and increase productivity. I thought back to those earlier articles when I saw a new letter in *Nature* in my RSS feed this morning, [Hundreds of variants clustered in genomic loci and biological pathways affect human height](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature09410.html):

> Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of > inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the > phenotype.

The [supplements run to nearly 100 pages](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nature09410-s1.pdf), and the author list is enormous. But at least the supplements are free to all, so you should check them out. There are a few sections of the paper proper that are worth passing on though if you can’t get beyond the paywall.

  
![fig1b](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/fig1b1.png?resize=400%2C337)![fig1b](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/fig1b1.png?resize=400%2C337)In this study they pooled together several studies into a [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis). One thing not mentioned in the abstract: they checked their GWAS SNPs against a family based study. This was important because in the latter population stratification isn’t an issue. Family members naturally overlap a great deal in their genetic background. Also, if I read it correctly they’re focusing on populations of European origin, so this might not capture larger effect alleles which impact between population variance in height but don’t vary within a given population (note that if you explored pigmentation genetics just through Europeans you would miss the most important variable on the world wide scale, *SLC24A5*, because it’s fixed in Europeans). In any case, as you can see what they did was extrapolate out the number of loci which their methods could capture to explain variation with the predictor being the sample size. At 500,000 individuals they’re at \~700 loci, and around 20% of the heritable variation. My initial thought is that I’m not seeing diminishing returns here, but since I haven’t read the supplements I’ll let that pass since I don’t know the guts of this anyhow. They do assert that they are likely underestimating the power of these methods because there may be be smaller effect common variants which can top off the fraction.

But even they admit that they can go only so far. Here are some sections from the conclusion that lays it out pretty clearly:

We envisage that thorough exploration of the genes at associated loci through additional genetic, functional and computational studies will lead to novel insights into human height and other polygenic traits and diseases.

The second to last paragraph takes a shot at David Goldstein’s idea of [synthetic associations](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000294).

We’re still where we were a a few years back though, old fashioned Galtonian quantitative genetics, a branch of statistics, is the best bet to predict the heights of your offspring. As with intelligence, “height genes”, are not improvements upon common sense. But if you’re going into the 10-20% range of variation explained it’s certainly not trivial, and the biological details are going to be of interest.
