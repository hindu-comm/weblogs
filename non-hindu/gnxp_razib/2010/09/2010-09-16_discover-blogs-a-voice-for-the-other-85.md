Discover Blogs, a voice for the Other 85%

![BoyBlogs1 (1)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/BoyBlogs1-11.png?resize=383%2C302)![BoyBlogs1 (1)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/BoyBlogs1-11.png?resize=383%2C302)Today I was curious what people thought of [Wired Science Blogs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs). More honestly, I was really trying to see if anyone else was a little put off by the forced registration to comment. But in the process I ran into this post, [In which I notice a trend](http://blogs.nature.com/ue19877e8/2010/09/15/in-which-i-notice-a-trend). The author did some counting before talking, which is always something I respect. Now, I suspect if you have read me closely over the years you can tell I’m not too worked up over lack of proportionality in the science blogosphere, whether it be of sex, race, ethnicity, religion (or irreligion) or politics. I say this as a Right-leaning brown-skinned male who was once termed “the black science blogger” at[ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/).

But can [Discover Blogs](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/) get some props here? Once they swap out the DNA logo and put in my [head shot](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/06/discprofile1.jpg) it will be clear that we’re much more ethnically diverse here than at the other “celebrity” blog networks! N = 2 far beats out N = 0. And [Wired Science Blogs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/science-blogs) even has a guy blogging for them who has the same surname as [Lou Dobbs](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/neuronculture)! How’s that for insensitive, I’m a naturalized American citizen (and look [at this title](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/09/kill-whitey-its-the-right-thing-to-do/), it makes me feel unsafe on the web! What’s he trying to say?).

Rest assured, Ed Yong and I are here to give voice to the 85% of humanity which is not of European descent, and, love to write about natural science. You can call us the [Chindia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chindia) of science blogging.\*

(and [Jeremy Jaquot](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/) of [Science Not Fiction](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/) is half-Asian I believe)

\* Indians will object because I was not born in India. Get over it, we all look to the same to everyone else.
