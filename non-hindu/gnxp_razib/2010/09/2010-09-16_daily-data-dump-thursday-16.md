Daily Data Dump – Thursday

[Detecting positive natural selection from genetic data](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/09/detecting-positive-natural-selection-from-genetic-data.php). “**I’ve tried to avoid the alphabet soup of acronyms** for tests for selection in the above discussion.” Eminently readable.

[A New Power Broker Rises in Italy](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/world/europe/16italy.html?_r=2&ref=global-home&pagewanted=print). An article about the Northern League. The inclusion of Tuscany indicates a “broad church” vantage point. An indication of the mishmash of policies (from an American perspective): “It is openly hostile to illegal immigration, an increasingly loud theme both in Italy and Europe. One Northern League deputy provocatively threw a pig’s head on the ground where a mosque was planned, defiling the lot. Popular among agricultural workers, **it is fiercely opposed to genetically modified crops** and European legislation that it fears would inhibit local food traditions.” Seems some Italians are blaming rising obesity rates on Chinese GMOs.

  
[Kill Whitey. It’s the right thing to do](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/09/kill-whitey-its-the-right-thing-to-do/). “While self-described conservatives more readily accepted the sacrifice of Tyrone than they did killing Chip, the liberals were easier about to seeing Chip sacrificed than Tyrone.” You can get a summary of the original research [here](http://www.peezer.net/storage/Pizarro%20PublicationsChaptersDitto%20Pizarro%20Tannenbaum%20.pdf), though not methods or raw results.

[CEO Behavior And Testosterone Levels](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/007490.html). No surprises. A few years ago there was a controversy with a manager at a hedge fund [demanding his subordinates take estrogen supplements](https://jezebel.com/310193/trader-lawsuit-reveals-secret-to-13-billion-hedge-fund-riches-estrogen-pills-pretty-dresses).

[Lies, damn lies and Chinese science](http://newhumanist.org.uk/2365/lies-damn-lies-and-chinese-science). “…. what we witness in today’s China is the way in which science – upheld since the early 20th century as the cornerstone of Chinese development – is repeatedly stymied by ideology, superstition, bureaucratic thinking and fear of dissent. This is a frightening situation.” Looks like nothing has changed since the days of [Cixi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi)!
