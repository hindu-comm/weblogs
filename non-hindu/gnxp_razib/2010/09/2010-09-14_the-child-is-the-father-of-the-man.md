The child is the father of the man

[Prenatal undernutrition and cognitive function in late adulthood](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/09/03/1009459107.short?rss=1):

> At the end of World War II, a severe 5-mo famine struck the cities in > the western part of The Netherlands. At its peak, the rations dropped > to as low as 400 calories per day. In 1972, cognitive performance in > 19-y-old male conscripts was reported not to have been affected by > exposure to the famine before birth. In the present study, we show > that cognitive function in later life does seem affected by prenatal > undernutrition. We found that at age 56 to 59, men and women exposed > to famine during the early stage of gestation performed worse on a > selective attention task, a cognitive ability that usually declines > with increasing age. **We hypothesize that this decline may be an > early manifestation of an accelerated cognitive aging process.**

Below the fold on the y-axis **malnutrition prevalence, weight for age (% of children under 5)**, on the x-axis [GNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI_per_capita) per capita PPP log-transformed (wealthy countries to the right). The size of the bubbles are proportional to population size.

I see a [harmonious society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonious_society) in our future!
