Friday Fluff – October 22nd, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)  
1. First, a **post from the past**: [The Round-Eyed Buddha](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/round-eyed-buddha.php).

2\. **Weird search query of the week**: “straight jacket sex.”

3\. **Comment of the week**, in response to [Glenn Beck, Evolution, Global Warming & Tea Parties](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/glenn-beck-evolution-global-warming-tea-parties/#comment-46599):

> People who don’t believe in evolution don’t comprehend evolution. > Evolution is a struggle to survive as a species. How else can you > explain Neanderthal man and the dead end they came to? They existed, > despite the Bible’s not bothering to mention them. The traits that ensured modern man’s survival were passed on genetically. That’s what evolution is; the passing on of traits that are more suited for the survival of the species. >
> This is all self evident. It doesn’t threaten religious orthodoxy > except in the most simple-minded way. You have to wonder if the people > who dismiss evolution because it somehow conflicts with their religious beliefs have ever taken the trouble to actually read Darwin’s “Origin Of The Species”? I’m gonna go out on a limb here and guess no. >
> Evolution is not only a fact, it’s a necessity. It’s all about a > species being able to adapt to it’s environment in order to survive. > Many species in the history of this planet have gone extinct. How do > you account for it? Was it God’s will, or something more plausible? How about this? They ceased to exist as a species because of their failure to adapt to their environment. In other words, their failure to evolve. >
> Homo-sapiens didn’t become the dominant species on this planet because > we had so much spirituality and trust in the Lord. How did we do it? > Here’s a clue, our eyes are located in the front of our heads like any > natural predator, we stand upright and have opposable thumbs. The > homo-sapiens with eyes in the front, who grasped weapons and stood on their hind legs to hunt, survived and passed these traits along. The traits most suitable for survival were passed along. Get it? It’s called natural selection. >
> As to how evolution gacked up a human hairball like GLenn Beck is another matter entirely. I think he must be some kind of double agent planted by the left in order to make conservatives look like a bunch of clueless, bloviating demagogues. Mission accomplished.

Often people who believe in evolution don’t comprehend evolution

More than 30 years – 14%  
16-30 year – 34%  
11-15 years – 10%
