Friday Fluff – October 1st, 2010

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Levels of selection & the full Price Equation](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/11/levels-of-selection-the-full-price-equation/)

2\. **Weird search query of the week**: “politcal correct cultures in science-fiction.” I direct you to [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin).

3\. **Comment of the week**, in response to Mormons are average:

> I am a Mormon convert with 11 children (11 is allot, even for a Mormon family). I joined the church at age 24 and am now 60. I have about 2 years of college (no degree) and have a good job at Hewlett Packard that I grew into. >
> It is expected that my kids will all have college degree’s (and so > far, the adults all do). Among the younger generation in the Mormon > culture it is normal to obtain at least a Bachelors degree. A person > (especially a male) who does not go to college is not normal in the > Mormon culture. It shows a lack of initiative and the more desirable, > faithful Mormon girls may not consider this person as a desirable > mate. The same is true for boys who do not go on missions. It shows a lack of initiative and faithfulness. In a Mormon lifestyle of high achievement and active church and community service, women do not want to be married to a sluggard for the rest of their lives. >
> Mormon youth grow up in an environment where most would not even consider skipping college.

**Poll question**….

5\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
