A sign that Facebook has peaked

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/facebook-icon-copy-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/facebook-icon-copy-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50)](https://www.facebook.com/GeneExpression)The other day NPR’s [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/10/14/130575234/we-bought-gold) quipped that the [gold bubble was going to burst](http://www.shareswatch.com.au/blog/wp-content/gallery/charts/10-year-gold-price-chart-jul-09.jpg) soon, as they’d decided to buy gold. Well, perhaps Facebook is nearing its bursting point…I [created a Gene Expression fan page](https://www.facebook.com/GeneExpression). I don’t have a good sense of the great utility of this sort of thing…you can after all find the two GNXP weblogs on the world wide web pretty easily. And I feed the blog posts to [two](https://twitter.com/#!/gnxpweblog) [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/razibkhan) accounts. I can see the value-add of Facebook’s selective semi-permeability when it comes to the “social graph”, but less so for websites which have a robust presence on the internet. GNXP in some form has been around for *over* 8 years. I can’t but help feel that this is a flashier [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) fan page.

Also, it has a URL that’s easy to remember: [http://www.facebook.com/GeneExpression](https://www.facebook.com/GeneExpression)
