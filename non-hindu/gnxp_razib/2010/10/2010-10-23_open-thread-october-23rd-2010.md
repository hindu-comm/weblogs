Open Thread – October 23rd, 2010

![2843169400_3449d772db](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/2843169400_3449d772db.jpg?resize=350%2C435)![2843169400_3449d772db](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/2843169400_3449d772db.jpg?resize=350%2C435)Autumn is here. And winter is coming.

The fresco to the left is the cover jacket illustration for [Why we’re all Romans](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0742567788/geneexpressio-20), a new cultural history which attempts to argue for the unique debts of Western civilization to Rome (in particular as a mediator of the wisdom of the Greeks and Hebrews). If you’re on the culturally conservative side it might be of some interest, it sports endorsements from a Fellow at the Hoover Institute and [E. Christian Kopff](http://www.colorado.edu/honors/kopff.html). The fresco is from [Pompeii](http://www.thecolefamily.com/italy/pompeii/slide25.htm), explaining its good state of preservation and present day fame and ubiquity. The man’s name is Terentius Neo, a wealthy merchant or magistrate apparently. The woman is presumed to be his wife. A strange question to throw out: am the only one who thinks that he resembles [Laurence Fishburne](http://images.buddytv.com/articles/movies/profiles/laurence-fishburne.jpg)? The fresco is used a lot because of its quality and prior fame, but I always start thinking of something ludicrous like *The Matrix* when I see it.
