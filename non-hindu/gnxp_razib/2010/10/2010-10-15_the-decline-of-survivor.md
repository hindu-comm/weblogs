The decline of Survivor

I just realized that the American television show [Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(U.S._TV_series)) is now over 10 years old. Though [The Real World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_World) had been around for nearly ten years when it premiered in the spring of 2010, *Survivor* was what triggered the lift-off of the current generation of “reality television.” I haven’t watched it since season (series) two, so I was curious what was going on with it. It looks like it’s been in [long-term ratings decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(U.S._TV_series)#U.S._television_ratings). The host received a [one year renewal on his contract](http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/02/jeff-probst-renews-hosting-gig-for-survivor-.html) early this year, instead of the two or four year contracts agreed to in the past.

Here’s the trend in terms of its ranking in the ratings:

And by millions of viewers:

Note the disjunction between the viewers who watched the premier, and those who watched the finale, on the first season. *Survivor Borneo* became a national phenomenon and built up momentum over the season. The second season, *The Australian Outback*,exhibited the opposite trend. The only outlier after those seasons is the *All-Stars*. Since season two it seems that the franchise has matured and is now slowly decaying into cultural and ratings irrelevance, though it’s had a very long run.
