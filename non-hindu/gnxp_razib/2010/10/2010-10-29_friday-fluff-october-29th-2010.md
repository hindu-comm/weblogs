Friday Fluff – October 29th, 2010

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Atheism, Heresy and Hesychasm](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2006/09/atheism-heresy-and-hesychasm/). I used to post about religion a lot more, especially in the fall of 2006. That was back when ScienceBlogs was small enough and tight enough to have a back & forth discussion among the weblogs pretty easily. I also was working a lot of hours at my job at the time and that imposed a sort of tight discipline on me, I remember hustling off posts after work, before sleep, and on Saturday (into schedule queue).

2\. **Weird search query of the week**: “dave mirra wife.” I had no idea who Dave Mirra was before I saw that query.

3\. **Comment of the week**, in response to [Daily Data Dump – October 25th, 2010](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/daily-data-dump-october-25th-2010/#comment-47598):

4\) OK, so last week’s poll didn’t work. In that it didn’t record any responses. Rather than do polls, I’ll just throw out a question, and let people answer if they so choose: which science blogs do you read? And do you have one yourself?

5\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**:
