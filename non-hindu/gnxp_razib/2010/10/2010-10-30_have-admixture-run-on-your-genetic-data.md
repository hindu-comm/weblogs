Have ADMIXTURE run on your genetic data

The last 24 hours of the initial sample collection phase of the [Dodecad Ancestry Project](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2010/10/last-24-hours-to-submit-your-results-in.html) are upon us. So if you have raw 23andMe data, you got a day to send it in, if you’re of the following groups:

-Greeks (not necessarily from Greece: Cypriots, Pontic Greeks from the former USSR, North Epirotes, Griko speakers from Italy, -Muslim rumca speakers from Turkey, etc. are all accepted)  
-People from the Balkans  
-People from Anatolia  
-People from the Caucasus  
-Italians  
-Non-Indo-European speakers from Europe (e.g., Finns, Hungarians, Basques)  
-Scandinavians and Icelanders  
-Iranians  
-Armenians  
-Jews from Italy, the Balkans, or Anatolia  
-Assyrians  
-Arabs

The point of the project is to get a better picture of genetic variation in Eurasia, especially in undersampled groups.
