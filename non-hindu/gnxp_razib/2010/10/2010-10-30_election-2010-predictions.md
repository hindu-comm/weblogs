Election 2010 Predictions

![800px-SarahPalinElon](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/800px-SarahPalinElon.jpg?resize=300%2C201)![800px-SarahPalinElon](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/10/800px-SarahPalinElon.jpg?resize=300%2C201)For Congress, I think that the breakdown will be:

Senate – 50 Republicans, 50 Democrats

House – 240 Republicans, 195 Democrats

My reasoning? I just took [FiveThirtyEight](http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/forecasts/house)‘s numbers and shaded them a bit to the Republican side. There’s no point in making predictions unless you predict something novel and a bit off expectations. Additionally, since the readership here leans a little Left I am inclined to tweak you guys a bit and make the political *Götterdämmerung* even more terrifying, though I didn’t want to push my luck and give you an implausible value which you’d reject on the face of it.
