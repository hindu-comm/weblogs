…Those Germans

I have a long post [reviewing](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/the-wheel-of-history-turns-to-the-gods/) [Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846681448/geneexpressio-20). Good book. In the process of blogging on the topic I found something kind of funny, but it was too immature to be posted there. I yanked some charts from [Gallup Coexist 2009](http://www.muslimwestfacts.com/mwf/118249/Gallup-Coexist-Index-2009.aspx). Basically it shows differences *among* UK, France and Germany on social issues, as well as differences *between* Muslims and non-Muslims. In general Muslims are more socially conservative, though the gap is the least in France and the most in the UK. Here are the charts, with the last one the one I found funny:

In general the Germans are more socially conservative than the French, except in that case where Western European nations have achieved consensus. But look the numbers for porn. Perhaps there’s something to the idea that Germany is the land of “[dirty porn.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/8013399/Smelly-people-commies-and-dirty-porn-Europe-mapped-by-national-stereotypes.html)”Also, still something to “No Sex Please, We’re British.”
