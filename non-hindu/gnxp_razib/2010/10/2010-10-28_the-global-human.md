The global human

Paul Conroy sent me a [link](http://www.quest.nl/braintainment/extra/quest101/winnaar-quest101-de-gemiddelde-wereldburger) to a Dutch article which purports to illustrate what the average human maleâ€™s face looks like. From what I can gather this is a *weighted* average by population. Click through and tell me what you think. Seems plausible enough to me.
