Daily Data Dump – October 28th, 2010

**A very special note:** I endorse [Christie Wilcox](http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2010/10/i_need_your_help.php) for [2010 Blogging Scholarship](http://www.collegescholarships.org/blog/2010/10/27/vote-for-the-winner-of-the-2010-blogging-scholarship/).

[A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09534.html). This paper is getting a lot of play. A taste of things to come from the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org/page.php). It’s OA, so check it out.

[Difficulties in Defining Errors in Case Against Harvard Researcher](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/science/26hauser.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print). I think Marc Hauser will be an emeritus professor by the time the case involving his alleged misconduct is resolved.

  
[Where did all these monkeys come from? – Fossil teeth may hint at an Asian origin for anthropoid primates](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/where-did-all-these-primates-come-from-fossil-teeth-may-hint-at-an-asian-origin-for-anthropoid-primates/). We were all Asians before we were all Africans! Before that perhaps were all Laurasians and/or Gondwanans. How about Pangaeans?

[Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and Risk of Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/11/2477). “…individuals in the highest quantile of SSB intake (most often 1–2 servings/day) had a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those in the lowest quantile.” Genetic background probably matters in terms of the effect size.

[The evolution of the marine phosphate reservoir](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7319/full/nature09485.html). “We propose that these two factors are intimately linked; a glacially induced nutrient surplus could have led to an increase in atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the rise of metazoan life.” Interesting stuff.
