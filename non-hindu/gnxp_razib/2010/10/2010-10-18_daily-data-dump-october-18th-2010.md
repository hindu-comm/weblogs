Daily Data Dump – October 18th, 2010

[Elitism in the Senate](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/elitis?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+GeneExpression+(Gene+Expression)). Harvard Law School:Tokyo University::Congress:Diet. Perusing [The Almanac of American Politics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892341203/geneexpressio-20/) makes it pretty clear that Harvard Law is way overrepresented.

[Barbara Billingsley Dies](http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/16/barbara-billingsley-dies-leave-it-beaver-june-cleaver/). All icons shall pass.

  
[Common variants at TRAF3IP2 are associated with susceptibility to psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.688.html). Will this pan out in replication?

[Am I partly Jewish? Testing ancestry hypotheses with 23andMe data](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/10/testing-possibilities-about-my-ancestry.php). Jospeh Pickrell confirms that he is 1/4 Italian via genetics (he also confirmed he has blue eyes! Fascinating).

[Rand Paul To Jack Conway: ‘You Demean Kentucky’](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/rand-paul-to-jack-conway-you-demean-kentucky.php?ref=fpblg). I still think Rand Paul [is going to win](http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/forecasts/senate/kentucky), but, if he loses it’s going to be open season on the religious views of American politicians in fine-grained detail and as far back as anyone can document. If you want “out” atheist politicians, at least temporarily before most get voted out, root for a Jack Conway victory.
