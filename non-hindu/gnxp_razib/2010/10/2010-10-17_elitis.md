Elitism in the Senate

As Benjamin Friedman laid out in [The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth](%20http://www.amazon.com/Moral-Consequences-Economic-Growth/dp/0679448918);a tolerant, accepting society is predicated on running the growth treadmill. Simply being prosperous is not enough — people need to feel that conditions will steadily improve over time, or else populism, xenophobia, and other measures of intolerance go up.

So as we enter the a “[New Normal](http://fistfulofeuros.net/afoe/an-unusual-but-interesting-argument-which-may-help-to-understand-why-qe2-is-now-almost-inevitable/)” phase where the steady economic growth and low unemployment of the Great Moderation can no longer be sustainably maintained, there will be substantial political upheaval as well.

One manifestation of this is the strongly anti-elitist attitude espoused by anti-establishment political candidates, among others. Barack Obama (Columbia, Harvard Law) and Sonia Sotomayor (Princeton, Yale Law), for instance, have been attacked for holding Ivy League credentials.

Whatever one thinks of anti-elitist attacks ([here](http://www.slate.com/id/2269576/) is someone against them, for instance); it seems worthwhile to point out that the anti-elitistsare onto something. Top College attendance remains a path to influence and wealth.

A recent [post](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/should-you-go-to-an-ivy-league-school) of mine pointed out that this is very much the case for income. A new paper by Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy (both teaching, of course, at Harvard)[shows](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16437.pdf%20) that this is the case for political power in the Senate as well.

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Picture-11.png?resize=640%2C284 "Picture 11")![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Picture-11.png?resize=640%2C284 "Picture 11")

Harvard, in particular, comes off as superstar — close to ten percent of Senators in the period covered (101-110th Congress) had a degree from a certain school in Boston. This is again consistent with the income data, and suggests that Harvard graduates collect certain “rents” that are not [properly accounted](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/10/neo-ricardian-notions/) for in most economic models. In certain areas, I think education is better modeled as a fixed quantity like “land” rather than a dynamic agent of production such as “capital,” and ought to be taxed accordingly.

Of course, there is the fact that politically minded individuals may be more likely to go to Harvard; or else hail from families that benefit both from legacy Admissions as well as [name recognition](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/10/political-dynasties) in political races (I’m looking at you, [Rodney Freilinghuysen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Frelinghuysen), whose family has been in politics since 1817) . So it may be tougher to figure out causality here.

Still, what we can do is figure out the impact of the political effects of elite University dominance. The paper goes on to analyze the role of the social networks generated by College attendance on legislative behavior. Somewhat predictably, they find that politicians who attended the same school are more likely to vote with each other.

Aside from the direct role of elites entering the Senate directly, wealthy Ivy League graduates influence the system indirectly. There is some evidence that the American system works on a principle of [one-dollar-one-vote](http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/5682), which will of course disproportionately benefit elite University graduates. That, too, has political consequences. As the author of that link (Harvard phD, teaching post at UChicago) points out:

> However, the growth of the rich’s income relative to the mean in the > US exceeded the growth of rich’s income relative to the mean in > Europe. According to the one dollar, one vote theory of the welfare > state, **the faster growth of the rich’s income in the US allowed the > rich to increase its political influence and tilt policy closer to its > most preferred redistribution which involves a smaller welfare > state**. \[emphasis added\]

It seems that colleges are at the hub of this. Wages for the richest are rising in part due to the fact that Colleges act to restrict entry at the best Colleges. In turn, that allows their graduates to earn more, influence the political system to clamp down demands for redistribution, and instead give back to schools to get their own children a chance at the good life. I don’t want to push this story too much, but it strikes me as reasonable. If this is how the system works now, we might as well move to a system where one dollar buys you one vote, and at least get some public revenue from this.

All in all, the US Senate comes off resembling the Roman Senate to an extent — both are/were headed by elites who are broadly unrepresentative of the “people”, who hold large financial interests spanning the known world, have interlocking connections with other elite groups, are
successful at intergenerational wealth transfer, and live in a highly unequal society. There is even some evidence that Congressmen use their inside information to [beat](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=4204676) the stock market. Arguably, one of the biggest differences is that Roman Senators were far more involved in military service.

Americans aren’t stupid. They recognize this. They’re just far less willing to put up with it when times are bad for everyone, and don’t look as though they’re getting better soon. I’d guess that the Harvard share of Senators is about to go down. I’m with [Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/10/will-america-come-to-envy-japans-lost-decade.html) — American political economy is built like a shark and cannot function without continued growth.
