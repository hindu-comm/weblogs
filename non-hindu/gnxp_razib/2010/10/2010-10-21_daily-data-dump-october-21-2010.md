Daily Data Dump – October 21st, 2010

[Bob Guccione, Penthouse Founder, Dies at 79](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/business/media/21guccione.html?pagewanted=print). [Playboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy#Circulation) has been in decline too.

[HUMAN GENE COUNT: MORE THAN A CHICKEN, LESS THAN A GRAPE](http://news.discovery.com/human/human-gene-count.html). Going under 20,000. Hey, it’s just a number, not the measure of a man.

  
[Robert Heinlein, We Never Knew Ye](http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/10/robert-heinlein-we-never-knew-ye/). Fred Pohl’s blog is really interesting.

[Only You. And You. And You](http://www.newsweek.com/2009/07/28/only-you-and-you-and-you.html). This is really confusing: “Terisa Greenan and her boyfriend, Matt, are enjoying a rare day of Seattle sun, sharing a beet carpaccio on the patio of a local restaurant. Matt holds Terisa’s hand, as his 6-year-old son squeezes in between the couple to give Terisa a kiss. His mother, Vera, looks over and smiles; she’s there with her boyfriend, Larry.”
