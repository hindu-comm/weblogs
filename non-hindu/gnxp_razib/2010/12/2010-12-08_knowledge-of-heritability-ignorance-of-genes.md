Knowledge of heritability, ignorance of genes

[  
Does the Slut Gene Exist?](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-12-07/does-the-slut-gene-exist/):

Fair points. See [my post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-cultural-construction-of-truth/) from yesterday. But I’m not sure about this:

> “There are economists publishing papers saying whether you’re conservative or liberal is an inherited trait. It reminds me of the old eugenics trope which was, poverty is inherited. Well, of course!” says Misha Angrist, the author of a new book….

There’s a subtle point here. Economists may assert that political disposition is [heritable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability), which is a subset of the inheritance you receive from your parents. It is the component which can be attributable to variation in genes, even if we don’t know the genes in question. There is no “height gene.” But we can agree that in the United States most of the variation in height is due to variation in genes (\~80-90%).

Long story short: there may not be a “slut” gene, but “sluttiness” may still be heritable.
