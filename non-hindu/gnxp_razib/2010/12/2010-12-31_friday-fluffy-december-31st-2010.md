Friday Fluff – December 31st, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100) 1. First, a **post from the past**: [Golden ideas](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2006/03/golden-ideas/).

2. **Weird search query of the week**: “young girls gone mature”.

3.**Comment of the week**, in response to [Slouching toward idiocracy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/slouching-toward-idiocracy/#comment-56206):

> JWM and Dave Both hit on key concepts here. >
> Its not just cats, cattle and humans, in fact the relative brain size > of almost all domesticates is smaller then their wild ancestors > http://tiny.cc/ty6n9 . This just part of a suite of changes that > characterize domesticates. Including reduced size, a more pronounced > forehead, a shorter foreface, overall increased morphological > diversity, a wider range of coat colors, long hair, curly hair, naked > skin, and reduced dentition. Most of these characteristics are seen in > modern humans relatives to our ancestors. Compared to erectines and > neanderthal and even early AMH modern humans are less skeletally > robust, have shorter forefaces and larger foreheads and smaller teeth > in more crowded jaws. Compared to chimps we are characterized by being having naked skin, long hair of an astonishing variety of color and form and increased morphological diversity even within genetically homogeneous populations. >
> The belyaev Domestic fox experiments http://tiny.cc/diffx, provides a > very intriguing clue as to why this might be. Belyaev was able to > induce all of the morphological changes typical of domestic animals in > foxes by breeding for a single characteristic, Tameness. Tameness can > be conceived of as openness to novel social situations and strangers. > This is characteristic of all juvenile animals but rare in adult wild animals. Selection for this trait seems to effect developmental genes which have major effects in morphology resulting in these typical patterns of morphological change. >
> Domestic animals are generally less intelligent then their wild ancestors but they appear to have domain specific capacities for social learning and thinking that their wild ancestors don’t http://tiny.cc/cjfpt. >
> I suspect that the development of just such capacities as been one of > the primary selective patterns behind the development of modern > humans. We may have lost some individual brain power but without the > evolution of those social capacities I doubt we would have ever been > able to harness that brain power to build civilization. I also think > it’s quite likely that the selective environment of civilization has selected for a horde new adaptions on traits like IQ and time preference which would have not been as advantageous for our paleolithic ancestors.
