Friday Fluff – December 24th, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100) 1. First, a **post from the past**: [Lions, and tigers, and snow leopards! Oh, my!](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/02/lions-and-tigers-and-snow-leopards-oh-my/).

2. **Weird search query of the week**: “Lions, and tigers, and snow leopards! Oh, my!”.

3.**Comment of the week**, in response to [Heritability and genes as causes](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/heritability-and-genes-as-causes/#comments):

> I’m delighted to have you human genetics folks on board now. But those > of us who have been dealing with these folks on plant science issues > for a long time know what they are up to. Some of them are even trying > to block funding for research training in developing countries because > the bill contains the word “biotech”. It doesn’t matter if you try to > explain to them that scientists in Africa need training for managing > seed banks, or doing MAS. They use “biotech” as a club to stop > research and training. Here’s the bill’s author trying to straighten > them out, to no avail: > http://thehill.com/opinion/letters/95017-rep-lugar-no-mandate-for-genetic-modification >
> They are seriously anti-science. This was just a particularly unusual > attack, and I’m glad it caught the eye of the genetics community. They > are using the same strategies as anti-vaxxers and creationists. They > techniques are getting more refined, I have to say. I’m calling it > “crank evolution”. It’s in linkage with “crank magnetism”.
