On to 2011….

Predictions, expectations, etc.

More use of the term [“polytypic”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12093345).

[Ötzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi_the_Iceman) turns out to have Near Eastern affinities.

The [Hobbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis) finally have some genetic material successfully analyzed.

Many, many, more [human origins stories spun out of control by the press](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101231/full/news.2010.700.html). Without a rock-hard interpretative framework like “Out of Africa” there is less “functional constraint.”

  
[Facebook peaks](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/compost/2010/12/facebook_beats_google_in_2010.html) in terms of *cultural* influence. Its user base and profits will continue to grow, but there will be a new “It” company.

The economy will grow faster than economists’ expectation. I don’t have great hope or insight, but economists’ forecasts are usually wrong, and lean toward conventional wisdom. The conventional wisdom is that we’ll muddle along.

More about [exomes](https://www.google.com/trends?q=exome).

The blurring between blog and mainstream media will continue.

The segmentation of the blogosphere will continue.

Barack H. Obama will be profile as the “comeback kid” by conventional wisdom peddlers by the end of 2011.

People will start to get annoyed by the proliferation of “social media” firms, and the bubble will burst.

[23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) will have 200,000 customers by 2011.

[Perl 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6) will go prime-time, but it will be clear that working on IBM-time meant that they missed their window of opportunity.
