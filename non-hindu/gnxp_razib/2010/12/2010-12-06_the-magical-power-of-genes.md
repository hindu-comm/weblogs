The magical power of "genes"

Liberal *Überblogger* Matthew Yglesias, [Pulling Back The Curtain on Human Behavior](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/12/pulling-back-the-curtain-on-human-behavior/):

> People sometimes seem to think that you could forestall a > Gattaca-esque scenario of genetic transparency through privacy laws. > But it seems to me that you’d actually need to go stronger, and not > only guarantee the right to not have your genetic information > disclosed. To prevent the emergence of a near-universal disclosure > equilibrium in a world of cheap genetic profiling over the long run, you’d need to ban voluntary disclosure. **The mere fact that you don’t want a potential partner to know your DRD4 profile will tell her all she needs to know about you.**

Let’s also neglect the real problems of banning this sort of thing in a world of commoditized sequencing or typing.\* I have some news for Matt & company, there’s already a much more powerful way to behavior genetic profile someone: **look at their family.** Indians have [long known this](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/901785--marriage-season-brings-out-elephants-white-horses-and-private-detectives). So the big short-medium term problem is that getting your hands on the biodata of anyone’s family members is one-click away….

**Update:** A commenter [points out that Yglesias](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-magical-power-of-genes/comment-page-1/#comment-53781) may have been advocating such a position to expose the absurdity of it. I wondered that too, but wasn’t sure and thought perhaps he was serious. In any case, I think the commenter makes good points, so I retract the charge. Though the bigger point obviously still stands.

\* Unless Matt has Victorian values I assume he could anticipate that it wouldn’t be too hard to get “DNA” from a prospective partner. How exactly a ban would work when there are places overseas doing sequencing I have no idea. It isn’t as if biological material is never sent through the mail.
