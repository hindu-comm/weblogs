Re-visualizing European ancestry

I decided to [take the Dodecad](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2010/11/admixture-analysis-with-dodecad_19.html) ADMIXTURE results at K = 10, and redo some of the bar plots, as well as some scatter plots relating the different ancestral components by population. Don’t try to pick out fine-grained details, see what jumps out in a *gestalt* fashion. I removed most of the non-European populations to focus on Western Europeans, with a few outgroups for reference.

Here’s a table of the correlations (I bolded the ones I thought were interesting):
