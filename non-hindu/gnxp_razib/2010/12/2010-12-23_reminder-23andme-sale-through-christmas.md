Reminder, 23andMe sale through Christmas

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/genesU.png?resize=389%2C194)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/genesU.png?resize=389%2C194)](https://www.23andme.com/)A reminder that [23andMe’s sale is valid until Christmas](https://www.23andme.com/). Including the mandatory yearly subscription to their “Personal Genome Service”, that’s \$160 (though you only get charged \$99 + shipping initially, the subscription is \$5/month). I didn’t quite go up to the 10 kits per person, but I did come close. There will likely be new amateur and/or open source [genome projects in 2011](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/genome-blogging/), so if you’re from an underrepresented community this might be useful as a public good. It is true that the probability of finding actionable medical information is low, but you can do whatever you want with your \~1 million SNPs indefinitely. Channeling [Sally Struthers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePENcrE_xcQ), can’t you afford the purchase of \~1 million SNPs for the cost of 10% of a cup of expensive Starbucks coffee drinks per day for a year? That’s 1/60th of a penny per SNP!

(and for the record, I am *not* getting a cut)
