The year of the Other human

**Update:** Please see [follow up post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/12/the-paradigm-is-dead-long-live-the-paradigm/).

Carl Zimmer, [Siberian Fossils Were Neanderthals’ Eastern Cousins, DNA Reveals](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/science/23ancestor.html):

> An international team of scientists has identified a previously > shadowy human group known as the Denisovans as cousins to Neanderthals > who lived in Asia from roughly 400,000 to 50,000 years ago and > interbred with the ancestors of today’s inhabitants of New Guinea..

John Hawks, [The Denisova genome FAQ](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/denisova-nuclear-genome-reich-2010.html):

> The most significant finding in the paper is the demonstration that > some living humans trace significant fraction of their ancestry to the > population represented by the Denisova genome. As in the case of > Neanderthals, different human populations show significantly different > levels of similarity to the Denisova sequence. For Neanderthals, the > similarities indicated between one and four percent Neanderthal > ancestry for living people outside of Africa. In the case of the > Denisova sequence, the greatest similarities are with living people in > Melanesia – in this paper, represented by genome samples from Papua > New Guinea and Bougainville. The similarities are consistent with > approximately 4% contribution of a Denisova-like population to the > ancestry of these living Melanesians.

The paper, [Genetic history of an archaic hominin group from Denisova Cave in Siberia](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7327/full/nature09710.html). It isn’t open access, but I assume the [supplements are](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7327/full/nature09710.html#/supplementary-information).

**Update**: [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/denisovans/). [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/12/archaic-denisovans-contributed-to.html). [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101222/full/4681012a.html). Gated, but another [Nature piece](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7327/full/4681044a.html).

**Update II:** This doesn’t work yet: <http://genome.ucsc.edu/Denisova>. But this does: [http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/download/DenisovaGenome](http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/download/DenisovaGenome/).
