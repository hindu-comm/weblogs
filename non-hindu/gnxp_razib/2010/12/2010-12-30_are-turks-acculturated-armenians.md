Are Turks acculturated Armenians?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/KurdArmenianIranianTurk121.png?resize=368%2C214)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/KurdArmenianIranianTurk121.png?resize=368%2C214)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/12/KurdArmenianIranianTurk121.png)To the left you see a zoom in of a PCA which Dienekes produced for a post, [Structure in West Asian Indo-European groups](https://dodecad.blogspot.com/2010/12/structure-in-west-asian-indo-european.html). The focus of the post is the peculiar genetic relationship of Kurds, an Iranian-speaking people, with Iranians proper, as well as Armenians (Indo-European) and Turks (not Indo-European). As you can see in some ways the Kurds seem to be the outgroup population, and the correspondence between linguistic and genetic affinity is difficult to interpret. For those of you interested in historical population genetics this shouldn’t be that surprising. West Asia is characterized by of endogamy, language shift, and a great deal of sub and supra-national communal identity (in fact, national identity is often perceived to be weak here). A [paper](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(07)60328-0) from the mid-2000s already suggested that western and eastern Iran were genetically very distinctive, perhaps due to the simple fact of geography: central Iran is extremely arid and relatively unpopulated in relation to the peripheries.

**But this post isn’t about Kurds, rather, observe the very close relationship between Turks and Armenians on the PCA.** The \_D denotes Dodecad samples, those which Dienekes himself as collected. This affinity could easily be predicted by the basic parameters of physical geography. Armenians and Anatolian Turks were neighbors for nearly 1,000 years. Below is a map which shows the expanse of the ancient kingdom of Armenia:

Historic Armenia was centered around lake [Van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Van) in what is today eastern Turkey. The modern Republic of Armenia is very much a rump, and an artifact of the historic expansion of the Russian Empire in the Caucasus at the expense of the Ottomans and Persians. Were it not for the Armenian genocide there may today have been more Armenians resident in Turkey than in the modern nation-state of Armenia,\*just as there are more Azeri Turks in Iran than in Azerbaijan. Many areas once occupied by Armenians are now occupied by Kurds and Turks. **But a bigger question is the ethnogenesis of the Anatolian Turkish population over the past 1,000 years.**

Dienekes has already shed light on this topic earlier, adding the Greek and Cypriot populations to the mix as well as Turks and Armenians. The disjunction between Kurds and the Armenian-Turk clade suggests to us that Turks did not emerge out of the milieu of Iranian tribes in the uplands of southeast Anatolia and western Persia. Like the Armenians the Kurds are an antique population, claiming descent from the Medes, and referred to as Isaurians during the Roman and Byzantine period.

Below is a reformatted [K = 15](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UOHFTxL-bOA/TOOXrHM37WI/AAAAAAAAANc/HZu372rvK-A/s1600/ADMIXTURE15.jpeg) run of ADMIXTURE with Eurasian population. I’ve removed the labels for the ancestral components, but included in populations which have a high fraction of a given ancestral component. The geographical labels are for obscure populations. I’ve underlined the four populations of interest:

First, let’s get out of the way the fact that **Turkish samples have non-trivial, though minor, northeast Asian ancestry.** The Yakut themselves are a Turkic group situated to the north of Mongolia. The more southerly and central Asian affinities the nomadic ancestors of the Anatolia Turks may have picked up in their sojourns over the centuries between their original homeland in east-central Siberia and Mongolia and West Asia. The rest of ancestry is rather typical of northern West Asian groups. In particular, Armenians! Here is the ancestral breakdown for the four groups I want to focus on using Dienekes’ labels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now the correlations between the populations by ancestral components:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|               |           |              |           |               |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
|               | **Greek** | **Cypriots** | **Turks** | **Armenians** |
| **Greek**     | \*        | 0.863        | 0.823     | 0.813         |
| **Cypriots**  | \*        | \*           | 0.941     | 0.946         |
| **Turks**     | \*        | \*           | \*        | **0.997**     |
| **Armenians** | \*        | \*           | \*        | \*            |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s remove the East Eurasian and African components, and recalculate the proportions by taking what remains as the denominator:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                     |           |              |           |               |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Population**      | **Greek** | **Cypriots** | **Turks** | **Armenians** |
| West Asian          | 38.1      | 55.7         | 51.8      | 57.0          |
| Central-South Asian | 5.4       | 8.9          | 20.0      | 18.6          |
| North European      | 25.4      | 5.8          | 13.2      | 12.4          |
| South European      | 27.7      | 21.4         | 10.3      | 8.5           |
| Arabian             | 3.4       | 8.2          | 4.7       | 3.4           |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the recomputed correlations:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|               |           |              |           |               |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
|               | **Greek** | **Cypriots** | **Turks** | **Armenians** |
| **Greek**     | \*        | 0.747        | 0.640     | 0.647         |
| **Cypriots**  | \*        | \*           | 0.901     | 0.908         |
| **Turks**     | \*        | \*           | \*        | 0.999         |
| **Armenians** | \*        | \*           | \*        | \*            |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all the \~0 ancestral components which were common across these four populations removed the correlations have gone down. **Except in the case of the Armenian-Turk pair, because I’ve removed the ancestries which differentiate them.**

So what’s a plausible interpretation? **A straightforward one would be that the Muslim Turk population of Anatolia has a strong bias toward having been assimilated Armenians**, rather than Greeks. The cultural plasticity of Armenians in late antiquity and the early medieval period was clear: individuals of ethnic Armenian to origin rose the pinnacles of the status hierarchy of the Orthodox Christian Greek Byzantine Empire. The [Macedonian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorian_dynasty#Macedonian_dynasty_.28867.E2.80.931056.29) of the Byzantines under which the civilization [reached its mature peak](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394537793/geneexpressio-20) were descended from Armenians who had resettled in Macedonia. Just as plausible to me is that eastern Anatolia as a whole exhibited little genetic difference between Greeks and Armenians, and the former were wholly assimilated or migrated, while the Armenians remained. One way to test this thesis would be type the descendants of Greeks who left eastern Anatolia during the [population exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey) between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s. But the difference between Greeks and Cypriots also points us to another possibility: perhaps the Greeks of Greece proper (as opposed to Anatolia) were much more strongly impacted by the arrival of Slavs? One need not necessarily rely solely on the [Scalveni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclaveni) migrations either, water tends to be a major dampener to conventional isolation-by-distance gene flow, so the Greek mainland may always have been subject to more influence from the lands to the north.

Whatever the details of ethnogenesis may be, it will be interesting to see how things shake out as we increase sample sizes and get better population coverage. These results may be due to regional selection bias. One might expect that the descendants of [Rumelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelia) Turks be more “European” than Anatolian Turks. But, these data do seem to suggest on face value that Armenians are the population which Anatolian Turks have the most genetic affinity with.

\* My main hesitation would be that Armenians are a very mobile population, and their numbers within a modern Turkey may have declined simply through emigration, just as those of Christian Arabs have over the 20th century.
