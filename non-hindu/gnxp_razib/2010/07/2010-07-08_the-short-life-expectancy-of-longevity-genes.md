The short life expectancy of longevity genes (?)

When I first heard in the media there was a new study of longevity which had produced a model based on your SNP profile that was “77% accurate” as to whether you’d live to the age of 100 or not, I assumed this was confusion or distortion (perhaps *The Daily Mail* had broken embargo first and its spin was percolating around the mediasphere). But later I listened to one of the researchers on the radio, and though he seemed to want to tone down the certitude as to that prediction, he did not debunk the claim. Whatever the details, I did not believe that the model was *that* relevant to most people since very few are going to make it deep into their nineties in any case (I did have a grandfather who made it to 100 \[in Bangladesh!\], so my chance is presumably greater than the norm). The model would be moving you along the margins. Additionally, over the years it has paid off to be skeptical of the discovery of large effect genes for X, Y and Z. When the X, Y and Z has medical significance I’m even more skeptical, because the non-scientific biases within medical research seem to be really strong. There’s a lot of fame and money to be had. Some of the media were asking the researchers up front whether this might unlock the genetic “Fountain of Youth.” This is entrancing stuff.

So is [this post](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/serious_potential_flaws_in_lon.php) from Dr. Daniel MacArthur, [Serious flaws revealed in “longevity genes” study](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/serious_potential_flaws_in_lon.php), warrants notice:

> If the paper’s claims were true they would be truly remarkable. > However, the general feeling from the GWAS community is that the > identified associations are likely to be largely or even entirely > artefactual, the result of failing to fully control for differences in > the genotyping methods used in the cases and controls. **The study > used a mixture of two different genotyping platforms (albeit both made > by Illumina) for their centenarians, while the control data was taken > from an online database containing samples examined using multiple > platforms.** Disturbingly, similar potential genotyping bias also > affects their replication cohort.

In the *Newsweek* [piece I mentioned yesterday](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/07/the-little-flaw-in-the-longevity-gene-study-that-could-be-a-big-problem.html) Kári Stefánsson has this to say about one of the platforms:

Stefánsson recognizing one of the 150 SNPs as a problematic one is another red flag.The effect sizes of the SNPs in the study seem really large, so that should make you curious as to what’s going on.Here’s a [post from 23andMe](http://spittoon.23andme.com/2010/07/07/snpwatch-uncertainty-surrounds-longevity-gwas/) suggesting we should be cautious of the results for that reason:

> -A large study combining results of four genome-wide association > studies of longevity was published in May in the Journals of > Gerontology. That study found no associations meeting their > pre-specified criteria for genome-wide significance. While they used a > more inclusive phenotype (age 90 or older), **it is surprising that > there could be so many loci associated with survival to age 100 in the > new study, some with very large effect sizes, yet none were found in > the larger study from earlier this year.**

23andMe applied the model (the SNPs) outlined in the paper and attempted to see if it had any utility in to their admittedly small sample within their own database. They found nothing of note:

> We took a preliminary look in our customer data to see if the proposed > SNP-based model described in Sebastiani et al. is predictive of > exceptional longevity.

If you go back to [Dr. MacArthur’s post](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/serious_potential_flaws_in_lon.php) he has a chart which indicates that even by eyeballing their are indications that the results in the *Science* paper were artifacts of the methodological limitations. *Newsweek* ends with this caution:

> Still, one has to wonder how the paper wound up in Science, which, > along with Nature, is the top basic-science journal in the world. Most > laypeople would never catch a possible technical glitch like this—who > reads the methods sections of papers this complicated, much less the > supplemental material, where a lot of the clues to this mystery > were?—**but Science’s reviewers should have. It’s clear that the > journal—which hasn’t yet responded to the concerns raised here—was > excited to publish the paper, because it held a press conference last > week and sent a representative to say as much.**

This isn’t about the media. They didn’t have to sensationalize too much; the findings themselves if correct are moderately sensational. But if Dr. Daniel MacArthur could spot something indicative of serious problems by scanning the supplements presumably it shouldn’t have made it through the review process without the issue being mooted and addressed. But then again, it’s medical genetics, and there’s a lot of pressure to find the roots of human morbidity and mortality. It’s a field where results like [ALH 84001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Hills_84001#Possible_Biogenic_Activity) abound. The heart wants what is wants. That’s why it’s nice to focus on less practical evolutionary genetic questions; no one really cares *that* much whether we’re descended from Neandertals. Right?

**Note**: [And earlier post](http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/07/longevity_paper_sparks_debate_1.html) from *Nature* with more quotes from scientists who are skeptical of the findings. Also, after reading the posts I did read the [original paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1190532v1). Obviously I was cued to fixate on the particular issues highlighted above, but it is often rather illuminating to contrast the clear and spare summary presented to the public of findings to the numerous moving parts in the guts of the original paper.
