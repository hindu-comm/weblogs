The ScienceBlogs hegira

I was going to post a set of links for the weblogs from ScienceBlogs who have left for new digs, but [Skull in the Stars](http://skullsinthestars.com/2010/07/07/the-sciencebloggosphere-is-a-changing/) is tracking it. Probably best to check in this weekend if youâ€™re really curious, some people are still in wait-and-see mode.
