Finland, still going its own way

Dienekes [points to a new paper](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/) which highlights genetic variation in Fenno-Scandinavia (or in this case, Finland, Sweden and Denmark). A two-dimensional plot with the variation is pretty illustrative of what youâ€™d expect:

Finns are [genetic outliers in Europe](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/05/genetic-structure-of-eastern-european-populations/), to some extent even in comparison to Estonians, who speak a very similar language. But, I wonder if the situation will change a bit when we have more samples from Finnic populations of northern Russia. **Remember that the nature of these representations is sensitive to the variation which we throw into the equation in the first place.**
