Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

[Patrimony and the Evolution of Risk-Taking](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011656?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosone/EvolutionaryBiology+(PLoS+ONE+Alerts:+Evolutionary+Biology)). Possible reason that organisms “mix it up” in behavioral morphs.

[John Zogby’s Cri de Coeur](http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWI3ZTMwZjJmMjJmZjQzZGY1NzA0OWI0N2Y5MGNkMjU=). Creative destruction in the polling business. What is bad for producers is often good for consumers.

[‘More poor’ in India than Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10609407). Concentrated in the [“Deep North”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India). The social underdevelopment of the subcontinent as a whole gets little press because people would rather focus on the liftoff of the upper segments, and their integration into the global economy. “People” here includes the Indian press, which I presume comes from the upper segments themselves and so prioritize the success of the open and global market because it has benefited those they know.

[Rich Countries in the Grip of Zero-Sum Thinking About Chinese Economic Growth](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/rich-countries-in-the-grip-of-zero-sum-thinking-about-chinese-economic-growth/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+matthewyglesias+(Matthew+Yglesias)). I tend to lean against neo-mercantilism myself. The rise of China’s economy will cause problems because of cultural-ideological differences with the West, but massive numbers of poor people is also a major problem and source of discord.

[What Do I, As A Blogger, Want From A Network?](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/07/what_do_i_as_a_blogger_want_fr.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss) No matter where Jason Goldman lands, I’m sure we can find him at [ResearchBlogging](http://www.researchblogging.org/).
