Reader survey results: Science vs. social science vs. humanities

About six months ago I did a survey of the readership of my two [Gene](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) [Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/) blogs (before moving to Discover). The N was around 600. You can view the [raw frequency results here](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?CID=30403&SurveyID=70954). One of the issues which I was curious about: **did the disciplinary background of readers have any major correlates with responses?** So I created three categories from the data on disciplines:

-Science  
-Social Science  
-Not Science

Social science had its own section, but for science I amalgamated those who studies Math, Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine. The balance were under “Not science.”

Turns out there’s no big difference, except for in calculus. A particular type of person must be attracted to the substance and style of this weblog (I suspect the biggest substantive difference between the readership and myself is that I’m on the extroverted side). I’ll probably post a survey for tomorrow, mostly to see how much Discover has changed my readership. But periodically I’ll also look at the results for previous surveys like this.

**Note:** Some of the results do not add to 100% because I rounded.
