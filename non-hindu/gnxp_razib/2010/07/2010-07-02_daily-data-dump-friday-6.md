Daily Data Dump – Friday

Have a good 4th for those who live in the States.

[Fast selection in high altitude, but how fast?](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/evolution/recent/tibet-altitude-2010.html) I’m not surprised that John Hawks has serious reservations about the population history of the model in the [paper I reviewed below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/07/why-tibetans-breath-so-easy-up-high/).

[Epigenetics and the Importance of a Nurturing Society](http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2010/07/epigenetics_and_the_importance.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). I don’t mind the normatively directed focus on this area of research so long as there’s some science squeezed out of it. I say normatively because people would really prefer a world where there was more elasticity in outcome, all things equal.

[What Cost for Irrationality?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2et/what_cost_for_irrationality/) The standard stuff with people messing up probabilities, though some people end up in jail because of that! Though if someone at *Less Wrong* posted on the beauty of irrationality in some cases, now that would be a comment thread.

[A Nation of Neurotics? Blame the Puppet Masters?](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/08/01/a-nation-of-neurotics-blame-the-puppet-masters/) Pathogens and how they might affect culture, again.

[Ethnic Distinctions, No Longer So Distinctive](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/us/politics/30bai.html). Belying headline I think the power of black African ancestry in American society is reinforced by the piece; no one would say that there’s any ambiguity in Barack Obama being non-white in the United States despite his 50% European ancestry. This includes Obama himself, who is generally low-key about his multiracial identity.
