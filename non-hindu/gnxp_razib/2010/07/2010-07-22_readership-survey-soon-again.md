Readership survey soon (again)

Since I’ve moved to *Discover Blogs* I suspect my readership has changed a bit. I have the results of a previous survey from early in 2010, back when I was at ScienceBlogs, but haven’t posted on it in detail. I’ll try and do that in the next few days, but I also will put up a survey for this incarnation of the weblog to see if there are changes. I’ll ask the standard demographic questions (age, sex, race, income, education, etc.), **but the comments are open if you are curious about something about the readership of this weblog and would like me to include a question regarding that issue.** I can’t guarantee I’ll add it, but I might.

  
Additionally, I want to highlight that I have a personal [delicious feed](http://delicious.com/gnxp) going. That’s where I usually get the stuff for “Daily Data Dumps.” If you want to subscribe, the RSS address for that is <http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/gnxp?count=15>. I also contribute to two other blogs, [Gene Expression Classic](https://www.gnxp.com/) and [Secular Right](http://secularrigt.org/). If you subscribe to [my total feed](http://www.razib.com/wordpress/?feed=rss2) you can get all the content of this weblog, as well all the posts for those two blogs, as well as my periodic contributions to [Comment is Free](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree) at *The Guardian*.

Finally, some blogs which you might not know about, but perhaps should. [A Replicated Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/), on the evolution of culture (with a focus on language). And I can’t recommend [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) enough. What blogs are you reading out of curiosity? I “circulate” my RSS feed subscriptions a fair amount outside of a core set.
