More Jews, fewer markers

At around the same time that the [two big Jewish](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/genetics-the-jews-its-still-complicated/) [genetics papers](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/genetics-the-jewish-question/) came out, there was [another one in](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/48) *[BMC Genetics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/48)* which I had overlooked. [It’s open access](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/48) so you can read the whole thing, but seems like they used 32 [STR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_tandem_repeat)‘s as markers. Their primary finding about Jewish populations was that there was a north vs. south distinction, illustrated in this map:

**Update:** The main author sent me this email:

There were two main points to the paper. 1. There is a > difference, on average, between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jewish gene pools and 2. It was only possible to detect this with a small marker panel when hypothetical ancestral or “host” populations were included in the analysis.

Jewish populations are heavily studied in medical research and so we wanted to demonstrate that Jewish populations from different parts of the world should not be lumped together for analysis in medical genetic studies. >
