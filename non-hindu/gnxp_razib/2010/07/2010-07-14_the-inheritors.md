"The Inheritors"

[![8853_jpg_280x450_q85](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/8853_jpg_280x450_q85-189x300.jpg?resize=189%2C300)![8853_jpg_280x450_q85](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/07/8853_jpg_280x450_q85-189x300.jpg?resize=189%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156443791/geneexpressio-20)I just purchased a copy of William Golding’s [The Inheritors](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156443791/geneexpressio-20). Golding is famous for writing [Lord of the Flies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0791098265/geneexpressio-20), a work of literature of such influence that it has made the transition into our everyday lexicon. But I just listened to a [podcast](http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/128499918/KERA_128499918.mp3) of an interview with a [biographer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1439187320/geneexpressio-20/) of the great author, and it seems that Golding and many of his admirers who are “close readers” judge [The Inheritors](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156443791/geneexpressio-20) as his finest novel.

The general outline of the plot is easy enough to find on Wikipedia, it is one of those stories about the transition from a “bushy” hominin tree of life to the dominance of *H. sapiens sapiens*. Neandertals are finally expiring as a species in the face of the advance of modern humans, who marginalize and extirpate all those who came before. But I get the impression that the execution of Golding’s attempt is very different from [Clan of the Cave Bear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553381679/geneexpressio-20). Not having read the book yet I do not know if William Golding’s depiction is up to snuff with the latest scholarship on the Neandertals (granted, I am not up to date on the latest scholarship on Neandertals!), though he did [guess correctly](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/10/neandertals-had-red-hair-ok-some/) in all likelihood as to their pigmentation. But, in light of the highly probable non-trivial Neandertal ancestry in over 80% of humans, I feel like revisiting Golding’s vision in the near future, **as we carry within our genomes the shadows of *both* the inheritors and the dispossessed.**
