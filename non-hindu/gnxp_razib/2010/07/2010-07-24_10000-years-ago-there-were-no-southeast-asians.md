10,000 years ago there were no "Southeast Asians"

I think this gets at the fallacy:

A few years ago some scholars asserted that [Kennewick Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man#Scientific_significance) resembled “South Asians.” I’m open to the possibility of a more complex peopling of the Americas, but until we get ancient DNA (something that is very difficult in the [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act)), it seems rather strange to make assessments of phylogenetic descent based on phenotypic similarities between one ancient specimen and modern populations.
