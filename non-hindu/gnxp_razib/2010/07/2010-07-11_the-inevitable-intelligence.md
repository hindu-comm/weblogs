The inevitable intelligence

I think about [Luke Jostin’s](http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=871) analysis of the growth in cranial capacity in the hominin lineage from last spring a fair amount. In particular, in the comments he [notes](http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/?p=871&cpage=1#comment-3097):

A particular configuration of traits or genes aligned early on in the existence of *Homo* seem to have resulted in increases in cranial capacities across divergent lineages. Robert J. Sawyer’s [The Neanderthal Parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_Parallax) series may be less fantastical in its premise than we would have thought.
