Malnutrition now, arthritis later?

[Of Moose and Men: 50-Year Study Into Moose Arthritis Reveals Link With Early Malnutrition](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100706204703.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)):

> “As the study entered its second decade there was increasing evidence > of Osteoarthritis (OA) in the moose population,” said lead author Rolf > Peterson from Michigan Technological University. “OA is a crippling > disease and is identical to that found in humans. It is commonly > believed to be caused by ‘wear and tear,’ but the complex causes have > remained poorly understood.”  
> …  
> Over the course of the study the team discovered a rise in OA as the > moose population increased, and a decrease when the population fell, > leading to the idea that OA is linked to moose malnutrition when food > is scarcer. **The team found moose that were malnourished when young > would develop OA in older age.** >
> “We have shown how malnutrition early in life increased the risk of OA > later in life, but this also applies to humans as much as to a herd of > moose in the wild,” said Peterson. >
> “These findings cast new light on how early humans first developed > OA,” said co-author Dr Clark Spencer Larsen, an anthropology expert > from Ohio University. “The study of human remains from archaeological > contexts reveals OA increased where societies changed from foraging > plants and animals to an increased dependency on farming.” >
> Such changes were documented in a mid-continental population of Native > Americans 1000 years ago. In this group arthritis increased by 65% as > society turned from foraging and hunting to agriculture and the > cultivation of maize. >
> “Initially the increase in OA was put down to increased joint stress > due to the labour of agriculture. However research now shows that, > like the moose in Isle Royale, nutritional deficiencies early in life > may have been the main cause. Early malnutrition was certainly a part > of existence for many pre-historic human societies, and remains a fact > of life for millions of people across the world, so this study is also > relevant for modern human society.”

The original paper is in *Ecology Letters*, and it should be online at [this address](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01504.x). I do wonder if more detailed understanding of the long term impact of early life nutrition is going to drive parents crazy with alarm as every new study which comes out produces a shift in recommendations.
