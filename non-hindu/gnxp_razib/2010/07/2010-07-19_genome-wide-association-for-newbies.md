Genome-wide association for newbies

It looks like [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/) has their own [Mortimer Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book), with an excellent posting, [How to read a genome-wide association study](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2010/07/how-to-read-a-genome-wide-association-study.php). For those outside the biz I suspect that \#4, replication, is going to be the easiest. In the early 2000s a biologist who’d been in the business for a while cautioned about reading too much into early association results which were sexy, as the same had occurred when [linkage studies](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/linkage-versus-association-mini-primer.php) were all the vogue, but replication was not to be. Goes to show that **history of science can be useful on a very pragmatic level.** It can give you a sense of perspective on the evanescent impact of some techniques over the long run.
