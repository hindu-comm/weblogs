Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

First, if you are a **regular reader**, and have not done so, please take the [Summer 2010 Gene Expression survey](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/default.asp?SurveyID=72013).

[A horse is a horse, of course of course](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/07/i_am_mister_ed.php). Horses, like dogs, *may* be able to “read” human cues. In general intelligence dogs are less intelligent than wolves, but geniuses at this. In fact before this highly provisional finding they were the only non-human species able to engage in this sort of behavior. Horses are less intelligent than donkeys, but I wonder if they’re more intelligent in this domain than donkeys. Donkeys are more like cats, and horses more like dogs, if we’re going to do analogies. The latter have a much tighter connection with humans. From the perspective of aliens I wonder if humans their co-evolved organisms (dogs, horses, chicken, wheat, rice cow, pig, etc.) are like a movable ecosystem.

[Thirteen new sample sets make their debut on the population genetics scene (Xing et al. 2010)](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2010/07/thirteen-new-sample-sets-make-their.html). I agree with the skepticism of the interpretation of the hypothesis that the ANI were Middle Eastern, for what it’s worth.

[Human Induced Rotation and Reorganization of the Brain of Domestic Dogs](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011946). If humans can induce this sort of evolution of dogs, why not [on themselves](Human%20Induced%20Rotation%20and%20Reorganization%20of%20the%20Brain%20of%20Domestic%20Dogs)?

[Leak May Hurt Efforts to Build War Support](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/world/asia/28wikileaks.html?_r=1&hp). I thought that was the point?

[Learning Multiple languages from Multiple teachers](http://www.replicatedtypo.com/evolution-2/learning-multiple-languages-from-multiple-teachers/1419/). Looks like there are different “equilibrium states.” So what shocks societies from state A to state B?
