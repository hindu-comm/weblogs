Summer books, what's readable?

Danny reminded me that I still hadn’t read [Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060935723/geneexpressio-20/). Since I know him a bit (at least internet “know”) I’ve decided I can’t put it off any longer, and I’ll tackle it soon. I just finished two books, [Replenishing the Earth: The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Angloworld, 1783-1939](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199297274/geneexpressio-20/) and [The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307407160/geneexpressio-20/). I can recommend the first, but not the second. Since I will (or plan to) review [Replenishing the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199297274/geneexpressio-20/), I won’t say more about it here. [The Secret History of the Mongol Queens](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307407160/geneexpressio-20/) was written by the author of [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609809644/geneexpressio-20/). The author is a bit on the pro-Mongol side (he always ends up making Genghis Khan a benevolent warlord!), and his writing style doesn’t have the density which I prefer in these sorts of works, but [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609809644/geneexpressio-20/) was a serviceable book. [The Secret History of the Mongol Queens](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307407160/geneexpressio-20/) on the other hand is too sensational, and it seems rather obvious that the source material was much thinner than for [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609809644/geneexpressio-20/) (he admits as much repeatedly), so he had to include a lot of apocryphal material, with caveats, to fill it out. I much preferred [The Cambridge History of Inner Asia: The Chinggisid Age](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521849268/geneexpressio-20/), which I read earlier this summer. A naturally more turgid work without a central narrative (each chapter was written by a different academic), but lots of dense data.

  
So what are you reading? What would you recommend? Over the years I’ve noticed I don’t read much science in book form; I much prefer papers. But since I don’t read physics or chemistry papers that means I haven’t recharged my familiarity, at least on a superficial level, with these fields in years. So I plan to a hit a few popular physics books at some point summer. And I’m always up for economics, world history, international affairs, cognitive psychology, etc.\* I suspect I’ll avoid fiction until George R. R. Martin gets [his next book out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons), but that might mean I’ll avoid fiction for a *long* time.

\* In my short-term stack [The Sea Kingdoms: The Story of Celtic Britain and Ireland](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841587176/geneexpressio-20/), [Lives of Confucius: Civilization’s Greatest Sage Through the Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385510691/geneexpressio-20/), [Superfusion: How China and America Became One Economy and Why the World’s Prosperity Depends on It](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/141658370X/geneexpressio-20/) and [The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307459659/geneexpressio-20/). In my medium-term “must-read” queue, [How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393066320/geneexpressio-20/) and [Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846681448/geneexpressio-20/).
