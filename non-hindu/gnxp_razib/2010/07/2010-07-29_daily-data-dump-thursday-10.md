Daily Data Dump – Thursday

If you are a **regular reader**, and have not done so, please take the [Summer 2010 Gene Expression survey](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/default.asp?SurveyID=72013). N = 300, so I’ll stop buggin’ now and start posting results in the next day or so.

[Ancient iceman’s gene map underway](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/07/otzi-iceman-gene-map-genome-/1). Does anyone have any inside dirt on Otzi? His mtDNA was an outgroup to any modern Europeans, but we know that there’s sometimes a [disjunction](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/the-three-layers-of-the-neandertal-cake/) between mtDNA and autosomal results.

[Protecting consumers from their own genetic data will come at a cost](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/07/protecting_consumers_from_thei.php?utm_source=networkbanner&utm_medium=link). Regulations have costs. Sometimes those costs are worth it (and result in long-term gains due to buffering of short-term volatility and such).

[Vitamin D Deficiency Linked to Arterial Stiffness in Black Teens](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100729074905.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). There has been some concern about supplementation in colored people based on studies with whites, so this is important. Many people with darker-skins, including me, have been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency and have started to take supplements. Anecdotally many of us report a decrease in respiratory infections and such. But it will be good when we have more rigorous studies.

[Study says Amish expanding westward](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100728/ap_on_re_us/us_thriving_amish). Amish future!

[Ancient DNA Identifies Donkey Ancestors, People Who Domesticated Them](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100728131717.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Any surprise that domestication was a bottom-up, not top-down affair? Command economies are good at increasing factor inputs, but not necessarily driving innovation.
