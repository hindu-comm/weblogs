Who are you‚Ä¶.

[Edmund Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/07/05/the-return-of-the-‚Äúwho-are-you‚Äù-thread/) has rebooted the ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù meme. I‚Äôll quote him:

> So let‚Äôs do it again. In the comments below, tell me who you are, what > your background is and what you do. What‚Äôs your interest in science > and your involvement with it? How did you come to this blog, how long > have you been reading, what do you think about it, and how could it be > improved?

I will try and be a little less‚Ä¶abrasive‚Ä¶on this thread in relation to comments, so feel free to let your hair down and ‚Äúde-lurk‚Äù üôÇ

That being said, I do take surveys of my readership periodically, so here are some of the demographic breakdowns which I have from a survey I took last winter‚Ä¶.

-20% of the readership responded that they‚Äôd been reading GNXP for more than 4 years

-50% have at least a master‚Äôs degree (22% have doctorates, 11% professional advanced degrees)

-Nearly 50% of university degree holders who read GNXP have a background in science & engineering (science = natural science + mathematics)

-78% are atheists & agnostics

-60% have no religious identity

-70% live in the United States of America

-80% are of European ancestry

-86% are male

-35% are on the political Left, 30% on the Right, and 25% Libertarian

-60% have no children

-12% are virgins

-82% have taken calculus

The above includes *both* GNXP weblogs. The sample size is north of 600 (the omission rates varied by question).
