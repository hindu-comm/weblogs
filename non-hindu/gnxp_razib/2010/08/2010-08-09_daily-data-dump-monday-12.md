Daily Data Dump – Monday

[Using Genome-Wide SNP Scans to Explore Your Genetic Heritage](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2010/08/02/explore-your-genetic-heritage/). Since Blaine showed you his 23andMe ancestry painting, here’s [mine](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/08/zdna.png).

[The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria](http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450.html).

[Mau-Mauing the Mosque](http://www.slate.com/id/2263334/?from=rss). One of the things I’ve noticed over the last generation has been the strange parallel victim/grievance/sensitivity cultures on both the American Left and the Right. Of course the two sides don’t agree on the proper criteria to set off their outrage meters, so lots of confusion and chaos ensue. Liberals abhor stereotypes in my experience, except of their political opponents. Conservative Christians are offended by atheism, just not their own atheism.

[Corporal Punishment of Children Remains Common Worldwide, Studies Find](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100809111232.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). To my surprise the study found that there was a wide range in beating of children in India. Without knowing any further I wonder if the Jains are the low bound community.

The genetics of height are awesome!
