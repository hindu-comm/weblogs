Daily Data Dump – Friday

Have a good weekend.

[Immune Responses During Pregnancy Linked to Schizophrenia Among Offspring](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100812135940.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). This is a known association, but the interesting point is that there may be conditionalities to the response based on genetics. That would explain the heritability.

[‘Fused’ People Eager to Die and Kill for Their Group, Research Shows](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100812111059.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). I believe that an individualist-rational focus in explaining this sort of behavior is probably not going to lead anywhere fruitful. Rather, there are group-level dynamics which are derived from psychological predispositions such as conformity. Starting with methodological individualism is necessary, but not always sufficient, to explain a human social phenomenon.

[Book Review: The Invisible Gorilla](http://scienceblogs.com/thoughtfulanimal/2010/08/book_review_the_invisible_gori.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). “If there is one book that every human should read, it is [The Invisible Gorilla](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307459659//geneexpressio-20), by Chris Chabris and Dan Simons.” I have a copy of the book and plan on reading & reviewing it, but Jason Goldman’s high opinion has moved it a bit up the stack.

  
[Indian Forces Face Broader Revolt in Kashmir](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/world/asia/13kashmir.html). When I have suggested to Indians that they should just evacuate the [Vale of Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir#Kashmir_valley) and simply hold onto Ladakh and Jammu, the response has been explosive. Though I know that there are logistical issues with retaining Ladakh while abandoning the Vale, I am to understand that those are being rendered irrelevant in the near future. So instead there are the old gems that there is going to be a positive-feedback loop of separatism if Kashmir is let go, etc. Perhaps with increased wealth Indians will have more to focus on than nationalistic concerns. Though I guess that hasn’t quite worked out for China….

Fertility vs. gross national income per capita (purchasing power parity & log-transformed) for selected Muslim nations + Finland:
