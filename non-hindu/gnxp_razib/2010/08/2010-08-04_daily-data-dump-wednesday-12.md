Daily Data Dump – Wednesday

[Does Coffee Work?](http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/does_coffee_work/) Maybe.

[Interfaith Marriages Stir Mixed Feelings](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/us/04interfaith.html). In regards to the mixed Jewish-Methodist Mezvinksy-Clinton marriage. American Jews worry a fair amount about intermarriage. As a small religious minority (with ethnic connotations because of the descent-group national understanding of Judaism) Jews are right to be worried about intermarriage rates on the order of 25-50%. But I do have to suggest that a probabilistic understanding of the threat that intermarriage poses to Jewish religio-ethnic integrity would help. It stands to reason that it is easier for two people from Jewish backgrounds to foster a Jewish household than in the case where one person is from a Jewish background and another is not. But there is no categorical guarantee in any of the combinations of the matrix, and in a world where intermarriage is a reality switching from dichotomous/categorical models to more probabilistic ones probably yields more juice.

  
[Relatives of Individuals With Autism Tend to Display Abnormal Eye Movements](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100802165408.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). If the heritable component of autism has a “threshold” aspect I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised.

[Culture Wires the Brain: A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100803113150.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). In the early 2000s [The Geography of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743216466/geneexpressio-20/) presented the cognitive psychological literature in this domain, so I’m not that surprised. But, it would be nice to compare continental Europeans to Anglo-Americans and East Asians. It turns out that in terms of many cognitive biases continental Europeans are mid-point between Anglo-Americans and the rest of the world. If the neural differences are an outcome of cultural input then you’d see that continental Europeans would be at mid-point. If the differences are hard-cored through genetics somehow then one would expect continental Europeans to but indistinguishable from Anglo-Americans.

[Virginia Heffernan Is Our Target Audience](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/08/virginia_heffernan_is_our_targ.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). “Inside baseball,” but still of interest.
