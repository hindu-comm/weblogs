Just pushing buttons

[Mike the Mad Biologist](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/), whose bailiwick is the [domain of the small](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/microbiome/), asks in the [comments](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/08/genetic-variation-within-africa-and-the-world/#comment-32269):

Since I know some human geneticists do read this weblog, I thought it was worth throwing the question out there.
