Ancient DNA and Norden

Genetics is now being brought to bear on whether [there were non-trivial population movements in the prehistorical period](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/say-it-with-me-volkerwanderung/). Or more precisely, a combination of genetics and archaeology, whereby the archaeologists retrieve and extract genetic material which the geneticists amplify and analyze. This has helped establish that [European hunter-gatherers were not lactase persistent](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/10/3736.abstract?cited-by=yes&legid=pnas;104/10/3736). This is totally unsurprising, but was a nice proof of principle. When it comes to ascertaining genetic relationships among populations, as opposed to specific traits whose genetic architecture is well established, it’s a bit trickier. Who knows how many population movements may have interposed themselves between the present and a particular period in the past from which you have samples?

A new paper in PLoS ONE reports findings which do little to clarify, though add weight to skepticism as to the definitiveness of earlier results, [Genetic Diversity among Ancient Nordic Populations](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0011898?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosone/EvolutionaryBiology+(PLoS+ONE+Alerts:+Evolutionary+Biology)):

Here’s a [review of an earlier paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/09/saami-not-descended-from-swedish-hunter-gathers/) on this topic. Here’s an important section from the discussion of the current paper:

I wouldn’t put too much stock in these specific results. The sample sizes and representativeness issues are probably such that each new paper is going to change our assessment. But, I think the section which I emphasized points to a shift in the *Zeitgeist*. Until recently there’s been a very strong bias among historical geneticists to assume that the genetic variation is more strongly affected by deep time events, and that recent replacements and perturbations will have less impact. I think there were good reasons for this assumption, and still are, generalizing from broader patterns. But the over-extrapolation of the rule-of-thumb may have led to models which will soon be falsified in many specific instances.

On a slightly bittersweet note, ancient DNA will be able to answer questions about the origins of many circumpolar populations, but will have far less to tell us about societies and cultures further south, simply because of less favorable conditions for preservation. The main exception to this truism will presumably be desert societies. For example, [Tutankhamun](http://www.kv64.info/2010/07/was-tutankhamun-european-consideratons.html) has been typed as of the R1b Y lineage.
