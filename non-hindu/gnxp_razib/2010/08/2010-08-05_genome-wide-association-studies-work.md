Genome-wide association studies work

A few months ago, [I mentioned](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/how-do-non-genic-polymorphisms-influence-disease-risk) an article in *Cell* arguing that many results of genome-wide association studies are false positives. This is obviously wrong, and this week, a [pair](http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)00829-9) of [letters](http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)00830-5) to the editor (including [one by Kai Wang](http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)00829-9) summarizing arguments he made in various comment threads here and elsewhere) take the authors to task. The [response from McClellan and King](http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)00831-7) is laden with *non sequiturs* and simple factual errors, but they conclude:

> We understand that many believe that most GWAS findings are > valid….Currently, GWAS results fail to explain the vast majority of > genetic influence on any human illness. Further, **most risk variants > implicated by GWAS have no demonstrated biological, functional, or > clinical relevance for disease.**

I’ve bolded the last sentence there, because it’s somewhat ironic that this was published the day after an epic genome-wide association study titled “[Biological, clinical and population relevance of 95 loci for blood lipids](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7307/full/nature09270.html)“. This paper is worth a read not just if you’re interested in lipids, but because of the massive effort put into functional characterization of the identified loci. For a few genes, the authors are able to show that altering the expression level of the gene in mice leads to the exact phenotype they’d expect, highlighting a number of potential therapeutic targets. At one gene, [a companion paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7307/abs/nature09266.html) describes a heroic series of experiments to identify the precise mechanism by which a non-coding SNP exerts its effect.

I allow myself to hope that these sorts of experiments will lead to a push back against [the bizarre notion that associations between non-coding polymorphisms and disease are somehow suspect](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/how-do-non-genic-polymorphisms-influence-disease-risk).
