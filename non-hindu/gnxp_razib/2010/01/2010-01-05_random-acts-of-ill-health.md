Random acts of ill-health

[Stochastic epigenetic variation as a driving force of development, evolutionary adaptation, and disease](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/28/0906183107.short?rss=1):

> Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory is based on exquisite selection of > phenotypes caused by small genetic variations, which is the basis of > quantitative trait contribution to phenotype and disease. Epigenetics > is the study of nonsequence-based changes, such as DNA methylation, > heritable during cell division. Previous attempts to incorporate > epigenetics into evolutionary thinking have focused on Lamarckian > inheritance, that is, environmentally directed epigenetic changes. > Here, we propose a new non-Lamarckian theory for a role of epigenetics > in evolution. We suggest that genetic variants that do not change the > mean phenotype could change the variability of phenotype; and this > could be mediated epigenetically. This inherited stochastic variation > model would provide a mechanism to explain an epigenetic role of > developmental biology in selectable phenotypic variation, as well as > the largely unexplained heritable genetic variation underlying common > complex disease. We provide two experimental results as proof of > principle. The first result is direct evidence for stochastic > epigenetic variation, identifying highly variably DNA-methylated > regions in mouse and human liver and mouse brain, associated with > development and morphogenesis. The second is a heritable genetic > mechanism for variable methylation, namely the loss or gain of CpG > dinucleotides over evolutionary time. Finally, we model genetically > inherited stochastic variation in evolution, showing that it provides > a powerful mechanism for evolutionary adaptation in changing > environments that can be mediated epigenetically. **These data suggest > that genetically inherited propensity to phenotypic variability, even with no change in the mean phenotype, substantially increases fitness while increasing the disease susceptibility of a population with a changing environment.**

Why you? Because.
