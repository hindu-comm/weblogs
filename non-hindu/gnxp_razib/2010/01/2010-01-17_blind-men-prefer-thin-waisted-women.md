Blind men prefer thin-waisted women

The waist-to-hip ratio research has been done to death, but an interesting twist, [Blind men prefer a low waist-to-hip ratio](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6H-4XWD03V-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a29821b4c71b93dd82db6ca85f56e4cf):

> Previous studies suggest that men in Western societies are attracted > to low female waist-to-hip ratios (WHR). Several explanations of this > preference rely on the importance of visual input for the development > of the preference, including explanations stressing the role of visual > media. We report evidence showing that congenitally blind men, without > previous visual experience, exhibit a preference for low female WHRs > when assessing female body shapes through touch, as do their sighted > counterparts. This finding shows that a preference for low WHR can > develop in the complete absence of visual input and, hence, that such > input is not necessary for the preference to develop. However, the > strength of the preference was greater for the sighted than the blind > men, suggesting that visual input might play a role in reinforcing the > preference. These results have implications for debates concerning the evolutionary and developmental origins of human mate preferences, in particular, regarding the role of visual media in shaping such preferences.
