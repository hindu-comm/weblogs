The genetics of Scottish hair color variation

In the aughts the elucidation of [human pigmentation genetics](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=skin+color+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) was of one the major successes of ‘omic’ techniques. The fact that humans exhibit some continuous variation in complexion was strongly suggestive that more than one gene was at work to generate the range of the phenotype. On the other hand pedigree based studies going back to the 1960s suggested that only a modest number of large effect genetic variants were producing the variance. Today we can say with reasonable certainty that about half a dozen genes account for almost all the between population variation in pigmentation. For example, on the order of 1/3 of the difference between Africans and Europeans in regards to skin pigmentation can be accounted for a genetic difference on the gene *SLC24A5*. Unlike [height](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=height+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) the genetic architecture of human pigmentation variance was ideally suited to being explored by the power of contemporary [GWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study); moderate frequency and moderate effect variants are numerous.  
![stacy_dash1.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/stacy_dash1.png?resize=150%2C176)![stacy_dash1.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/stacy_dash1.png?resize=150%2C176)Of course pigmentation is more than skin. The original work in mice paid attention to coat color as well as flesh, and humans vary in hair and eye color in addition to skin. While skin color variance is controlled by genetic differences across half a dozen genes, most of the variance in human eye color seems to be localized around the [OCA2/HERC2](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=oca2+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) locus (we’re talking blue vs. brown mostly). Additionally, there is naturally an overlap between the genes which have been implicated in the variation of skin, hair and eye pigmentation, though the details of exact relationship between the genetic architecture of these traits must be kept in mind so as to explain relatively dark-skinned individuals with light eye color (such as the actress [Stacey Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Dash), who is of Native American, African American and European American ancestry).  
Nevertheless, one concern in modeling hair and eye color as opposed to skin color is that in the case of the latter there has been significant quantitatization in the form of skin reflectance values (those with dark skin naturally absorb more radiation from a source). With eye and hair color categorical labeling discards useful information in the form of phenotypic variance which is artificially collapsed into a few classes. A new paper attempts to take a step forward and correct this defect, at least in relation to hair color. [Genetic determinants of hair and eye colour in the Scottish and Danish populations](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/88):

A previously unreported association with the HPS3 gene was seen in the Scottish population. However, although this replicated in the smaller cohort of the Danish population, no association was seen when the whole study population was analysed.

In this paper they looked at the genes which have been implicated previously in pigmentation variation. The main value-add seems to be mapping the genetic variants of interest onto three quantitative dimensions of hair color variance, L\*(dark/light), a\*(red) b\*(yellow). Remember that hair has two primary pigments, eumelanin, the brown one which we are familiar with, and [pheomelanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Melanin_in_humans), which results in a reddish tint. Many red-haired individuals have relatively low levels of eumelanin combined with normal or high levels of pheomelanin, resulting in their distinctive complexion. When very dark-haired people bleach their hair initial treatments may result in a copper-color as the eumelanin no long masks phenomelanin (I know this from personal experience). It seems that red-hair can be conceived as a serial loss of function across many genes; in other words, a wide range of pigment producing genes have to have reduced function.\*  
Here’s a table which shows the relationship between hair and eye color:

You can see the associations through visual inspection, but it is also statistically significant. Those with dark hair tend to have dark eyes, and those with light eyes tend to have light hair. But the associations are not exact, and that is informative as well.  
Below I’ve reformatted table 3. What you see are genes, the quantitative trait of red shading, and the categorical value of the trait associated with a particular genetic marker. Remember that R² represents the proportion of the variance of the trait, in this case the value of a\*, which can be explained by the variance in genes.  
![scot2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/scot2.png?resize=500%2C1331)![scot2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/scot2.png?resize=500%2C1331)  
Note that *MC1R* is validated as a major predictor of red hair color. Quantitative measurement should confirm what we already know, making our comprehension more precise, and possibly smoke out relationships which were masked previously because of the manner in which one classified traits. The *KITLG* locus had previous been associated with increased odds of blonde hair, and here we see its quantitative relationship to red hair. A similar table with eye color confirms the importance of *OCA2*.  
Here’s another way to visualize the effect an SNP on *KITLG* has on hair color (red and yellow shading respectively) by genotype:

Many of these findings were replicated in a Danish sample, but since they didn’t use a quantitative measure there wasn’t as much value-add.

\* These rules are not hard & fast, there are [daywalkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Broflovski), individuals with normal pigmentation excepting their red hair.
