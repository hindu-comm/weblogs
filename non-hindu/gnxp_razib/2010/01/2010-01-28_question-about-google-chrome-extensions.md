Question about Google Chrome Extensions

I’ve got a few installed now. Has anyone had any issues with performance yet? I recall back when I used Firefox that was the main downside of having extensions.  
If you don’t know what I’m talking about, [see TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/25/google-chrome-for-windows-extensions/). Or just update your browser and Google will start telling you all about it, in Settings -\> About Google Chrome.
