Doberman Pinscher with OCD

![doberman.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/doberman.png?resize=150%2C336)![doberman.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/doberman.png?resize=150%2C336)In the wake of my post on selection and variation in dog skull shape, I thought it would be useful to point to this short paper, [A canine chromosome 7 locus confers compulsive disorder susceptibility](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v15/n1/full/mp2009111a.html). Here’s the conclusion:

> **The highly significant association of CCD with the CDH2 region on > chromosome 7 is the first genetic locus identified for any animal > compulsive disorder, and raises the intriguing possibility that CDH2 > and other neuronal adhesion proteins are involved in human compulsive > behaviors.** A genetic association of cadherins with autism spectrum > disorder, which often includes repetitive and compulsive behaviors, > has also recently been reported…As little is known about the > underlying molecular mechanisms for compulsive behaviors, this > discovery could provide a better understanding of disease biology and > facilitate development of genetic tests, enabling earlier > interventions and even treatment or prevention of compulsive disorders > in at-risk canines and humans.

[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/science/19dogs.html?src=sch&pagewanted=print) has much more.
