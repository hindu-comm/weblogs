Tiny dogs are freaks of evolution

It is well known that feral dogs don’t usually look like [Pekingese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekingese). Seeing as how strange looking small dogs often evoke hostility on the part of humans who are *not* their owners, the critical role of their owners in keeping these morphs around is self-evident. By contrast working dogs tend to look more “normal.” The difference is like contrasting the haute couture you’d see during [fashion week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_week), and the kind of apparel you’d actually wear in real life.  
As noted by the researchers above, skull shape is probably the tip of the ice berg. There’s a lot of [behavioral variation in dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#Intelligence_and_behavior), no one would confuse a pitbull with a golden. Finally, I think one big picture analogy might be our own species, who are quite possibly self-domesticated….  
The paper will be out in a few days in [The American Naturalist](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/showForthcomingToc?journalCode=an).
