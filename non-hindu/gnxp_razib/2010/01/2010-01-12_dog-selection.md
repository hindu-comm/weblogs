Dog selection

[Tracking footprints of artificial selection in the dog genome](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/01/06/0909918107.short?rss=1):

> The size, shape, and behavior of the modern domesticated dog has been > sculpted by artificial selection for at least 14,000 years. The > genetic substrates of selective breeding, however, remain largely > unknown. Here, we describe a genome-wide scan for selection in 275 > dogs from 10 phenotypically diverse breeds that were genotyped for > over 21,000 autosomal SNPs. We identified 155 genomic regions that > possess strong signatures of recent selection and contain candidate > genes for phenotypes that vary most conspicuously among breeds, > including size, coat color and texture, behavior, skeletal morphology, > and physiology. In addition, we demonstrate a significant association > between HAS2 and skin wrinkling in the Shar-Pei, and provide evidence > that regulatory evolution has played a prominent role in the > phenotypic diversification of modern dog breeds. Our results provide a > first-generation map of selection in the dog, illustrate how such maps > can rapidly inform the genetic basis of canine phenotypic variation, > and provide a framework for delineating the mechanistic basis of how > artificial selection promotes rapid and pronounced phenotypic > evolution.
