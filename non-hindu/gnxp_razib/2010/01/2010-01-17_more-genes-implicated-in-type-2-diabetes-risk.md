More genes implicated in type 2 diabetes risk

[New genetic loci implicated in fasting glucose homeostasis and their impact on type 2 diabetes risk](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.520.html):

The [odds ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio) look modest, so any one susceptibility allele shouldn’t give you a heart attack. But until sugar binging becomes less of a feature of modern nutrition it seems that this avenue of research will remain robust and worthwhile. Most of the bang-for-your-buck in terms of increased risk for type 2 is probably already evident for people through family history, but perhaps the magical authority of Science will sway those who are blase about pedigrees….
