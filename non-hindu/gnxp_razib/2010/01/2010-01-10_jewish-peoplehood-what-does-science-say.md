Jewish peoplehood, what does science say?

[The New Republic](http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/indecent-proposal) has published a [review](http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/indecent-proposal) of the book [The Invention of the Jewish People](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1844674223/geneexpressio-20/). There is a genetic aspect to the story:

I’ve had a few people ask me about Shlomo Sand’s work of scholarship. Like many interpretations of history a little bit of shading can go a long way, and even without genetic science Sand’s assertions seem highly tendentious without some extremely flexible semantic gymnastics (i.e., how one defines nation and people can probably be twisted sufficiently so as to allow one to not dismiss Sand’s thesis on prima facie grounds).  
But it is interesting to see how people interpret the findings of natural science. My [previous posts](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=jewish+genetics+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) on [Ashkenazi Jewish genetics](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=jewish+genetics+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) have been used as evidence by both those wishing to assert that Jews are white and non-white for either anti-Semitic or philo-Semitic reasons.  
Just as terms such as “nation” are not always clear and distinct, the implications from statistical sciences whose categories only roughly correspond to social ones can be fuzzy. The filter with which we view the world can quickly generate a wide range of conclusions from the same exact data. Through the glass darkly indeed….  
**Note:** As one of the world’s many who are outside of the two sets of those who consider themselves Zionist and anti-Zionist, the political implications are of academic interest only.
