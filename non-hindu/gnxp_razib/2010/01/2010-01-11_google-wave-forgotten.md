Google Wave, forgotten

I hadn’t logged into my Google Wave account for about a month. No one seems to be using it. But I checked it out the other day, and it seems someone finally contacted me last week…turns out it was an “old friend” who I’ve been ignoring because of his anti-social personality disorder (blocked him from my regular Gmail account). Thanks Google Wave for helping me reconnect with people who I’ve been trying to avoid!
