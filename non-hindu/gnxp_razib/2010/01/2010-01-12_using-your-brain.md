Using your brain

[Frequent Cognitive Activity Compensates for Education Differences in Episodic Memory](http://journals.lww.com/ajgponline/Abstract/2010/01000/Frequent_Cognitive_Activity_Compensates_for.3.aspx):

> Results: The two cognitive measures were regressed on education, > cognitive activity frequency, and their interaction, while controlling > for the covariates. Education and cognitive activity were > significantly correlated with both cognitive abilities. The > interaction of education and cognitive activity was significant for > episodic memory but not for executive functioning. >
> Conclusion: Those with lower education had lower cognitive > functioning, but this was qualified by level of cognitive activity. > **For those with lower education, engaging frequently in cognitive > activities showed significant compensatory benefits for episodic > memory**, which has promise for reducing social disparities in > cognitive aging.”

Here’s some **survey** data on books from a few years ago, [One in Four Read No Books Last Year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/21/AR2007082101045_pf.html):

> One in four adults read no books at all in the past year, according to > an Associated Press-Ipsos poll released Tuesday. Of those who did > read, women and older people were most avid, and religious works and > popular fiction were the top choices. >
> … >
> “I just get sleepy when I read,” said Richard Bustos of Dallas, a > habit with which millions of Americans can doubtless identify. Bustos, > a 34-year-old project manager for a telecommunications company, said > he had not read any books in the last year and would rather spend time > in his backyard pool. >
> … >
> In 2004, a National Endowment for the Arts report titled “Reading at > Risk” found only 57 percent of American adults had read a book in > 2002, a four percentage point drop in a decade. The study faulted > television, movies and the Internet. >
> Who are the 27 percent of people the AP-Ipsos poll found hadn’t read a > single book this year? Nearly a third of men and a quarter of women > fit that category. They tend to be older, less educated, lower income, > minorities, from rural areas and less religious. >
> … >
> People from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least > one book in the past year. Southerners who do read, however, tend to > read more books, mostly religious books and romance novels, than > people from other regions. Whites read more than blacks and Hispanics, > and those who said they never attend religious services read nearly > twice as many as those who attend frequently. >
> There was even some political variety evident, with Democrats and > liberals typically reading slightly more books than Republicans and > conservatives. >
> The Bible and religious works were read by two-thirds in the survey, > more than all other categories. Popular fiction, histories, > biographies and mysteries were all cited by about half, while one in > five read romance novels. Every other genre – including politics, > poetry and classical literature – were named by fewer than five > percent of readers. >
> More women than men read every major category of books except for > history and biography. Industry experts said that confirms their > observation that men tend to prefer nonfiction.

Here’s the GSS when it comes to comparing educational attainment & WORDSUM, limiting the sample to 1998 and after:

I assume readers of this weblog are more familiar with the dull who have educational qualifications, but it is important to note that there are a non-trivial number of brights who for whatever reason didn’t go on to obtain higher education (though this is more true of older age cohorts in the United States).
