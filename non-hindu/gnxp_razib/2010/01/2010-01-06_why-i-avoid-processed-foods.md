Why I avoid processed foods

OK, there are many reasons. And I’m not a calorie counter, but really I avoid processed foods because I have a very fuzzy intuitive sense of what I’m putting into myself. If I took the time to analyze the labels in detail, it seems clear that there’s going to be a lot of error. This isn’t a surprising finding, it’s been reported before. It makes common sense, as the key economic driver is going to be be making food taste better and cheaper, not reducing the measurement error baked-into-the-cake of their labels. And no surprise that the measurements are erring on underestimating calorie-counts.
