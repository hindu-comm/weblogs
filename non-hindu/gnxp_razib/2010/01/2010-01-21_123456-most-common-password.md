123456 most common password?

[If Your Password Is 123456, Just Make It HackMe](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/technology/21password.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

> Back at the dawn of the Web, the most popular account password was “12345.”  
> Today, it’s one digit longer but hardly safer: “123456.”  
> Despite all the reports of Internet security breaches over the years, including the recent attacks on Google’s e-mail service, many people have reacted to the break-ins with a shrug.  
> According to a new analysis, one out of five Web users still decides to leave the digital equivalent of a key under the doormat: they choose a simple, easily guessed password like “abc123,” “iloveyou” or even “password” to protect their data.  
> …  
> Imperva found that nearly 1 percent of the 32 million people it studied had used “123456” as a password. The second-most-popular password was “12345.” Others in the top 20 included “qwerty,” “abc123” and “princess.”  
> More disturbing, said Mr. Shulman, was that about 20 percent of people on the RockYou list picked from the same, relatively small pool of 5,000 passwords.

But really, the end user is the root of some of the problems of security within the cloud.
