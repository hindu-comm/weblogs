Face recognition not correlated with IQ

[Heritability of the Specific Cognitive Ability of Face Perception](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4Y3TF4N-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e7fad012507964192c84f93d3f021592#aff1):

Here’s some more from [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119172758.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

Because identical twins have 100 percent of their genes in > common while fraternal twins have just 50 percent, traits that are strongly hereditary are more similar between identical twins than between fraternal twins. (Identical twins still show variability because of the influence of environmental factors.)

Liu and Kanwisher are now investigating whether other cognitive abilities, such as language processing, understanding numbers, or navigation, are also heritable and independent from general intelligence and other cognitive abilities.

I’ve [blogged about prosopagnosia](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=prosopagnosia+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) before, which is a much more extreme manifestation of lack of face recognition than they’re talking about here. These “face blind” individuals are shockingly common within the general population, 1 out of 50 humans. I haven’t heard it reported that these individuals are particularly unintelligent, so it stands to reason that there’d be no relationship between intelligence and the ability to recognize faces. I happen to know some individuals with this issue, and they’ve developed “tricks” to compensate, so I know firsthand that they’re not necessarily a dull lot.  
So how to reconcile the heritability of IQ with domain specific competencies that exhibit modularity? I think the model in terms of [genetic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_architecture) is pretty simple. General intelligence is a quantitative trait characterized by a normal distribution; the bell curve. This is because variation on the trait is due to many genes of small effect; i.e., each genetic variant which controls variation of IQ has only a very small effect on the trait. By contrast, imagine that face recognition is controlled by a few genes of large effect, for example, five genes controlling most of the variance of the trait. **Even if these five genes which control face recognition ability also affect intelligence, their contribution to the variance on the latter is going to be trivial because any specific gene has only a small effect, at least in the normal range.** I assume that this sort of dynamic could characterize many domain specific cognitive traits.
