Darwin wuz wrong, part n

A [review](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/did-charles-darwin-get-it-wrong-1882253.html) of a new book, [What Darwin Got Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374288798/geneexpressio-20/). Co-authored by Jerry Fodor, who has been continuing his [war against natural selection](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n20/jerry-fodor/why-pigs-dont-have-wings). I’ve already read [Darwinian Fairytales: Selfish Genes, Errors of Heredity, and Other Fables of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594032009/geneexpressio-20/) (at the suggestion of a reader who found the arguments within incredibly persuasive, convincing me to simply ignore anything that reader ever asserted after finishing the book), so I think I have my quota of philosopher-declaring-evolution-the-naked-emperor under my belt. Meanwhile, there are [real scholars](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19744124) grappling with the issues which emerged in the wake of the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis and its discontents, and pushing science forward.

Yes, Darwin *was* wrong about many things. But how many scientists will still have such an impact 150 into the future? He’s a big enough figure that people can sell books just by putting his name into the title! Only a
[few](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618711686/geneexpressio-20/) [others](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205753/geneexpressio-20/) fall into that class.

**Note:** Here you can read a draft of the [third chapter](http://www.chd.ucsd.edu/seminar/documents/Fodor.Chapter3.pdf) of [What Darwin Got Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374288798/geneexpressio-20/).
