Show me the data

**Update:** Also see [p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/01/bold-prediction-synthetic-associations.php) at [Gene Expression Classic.  
Follow up on](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/01/bold-prediction-synthetic-associations.php) yesterday’s post on the new [Dickson et al. paper](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000294) from David Goldstein’s lab, [A New Way to Look for Diseases’ Genetic Roots](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/science/26gene.html?pagewanted=print):

> The Icelandic gene-hunting firm deCODE genetics, which emerged last > week from bankruptcy, has long led in detecting SNPs associated with > common disease. Dr. Kari Stefansson, the company’s founder and > research director, agreed that whole genome sequencing would “give us > a lot of extremely exciting data.” But he disputed Dr. Goldstein’s > view that rare variants carried most of the missing heritability. Both > deCODE genetics and scientists at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, > Mass., have sequenced regions of the genome surrounding SNPs in search > of rare variants, but have found very few, Dr. Stefansson said.  
> **“We can speculate till we are blue in our faces,” he said, “but the > fact of the matter is that there is no substitute for data.”**

It would have been nice to get a quote from someone whose recent career hasn’t been as checkered as Stefansson. The issue of [missing heritability](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=%22missing+heritability%22&aq=f&aql=&aqi=g-c1g1g-c1g1&oq=) is going to be interesting in the near future….
