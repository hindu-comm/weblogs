Bat & whale echolocation genetic convergence

This obviously plays into the arguments about contingency and inevitability. On the one hand the convergence across these two taxa suggest that this trait seems to result in an inevitable genetic architecture. But *perhaps* only for mammals. So inevitability might be a contingent aspect of evolution here. Reminds me a bit of [opsins and vision](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008838).
