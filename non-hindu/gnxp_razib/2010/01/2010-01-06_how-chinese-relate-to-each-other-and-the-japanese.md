How Chinese relate to each other and the Japanese

Last month I pointed to a paper on Chinese population structure, [Genomic Dissection of Population Substructure of Han Chinese and Its Implication in Association Studies](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00470-4). One to note was that the average [FST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_index) differentiation Han populations was on the order of 0.002, while those differentiating Europeans was on the order of 0.009. Below are the various Han population, along with Japanese. CHB = Beijing, while CHD = Denver. The Denver sample is probably biased toward Cantonese and Fujianese, since most American Chinese are from these two groups. As a point of reference, here are [South Asian genetic distances.](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/09/visualizing_caste_linguistic_d.php)
