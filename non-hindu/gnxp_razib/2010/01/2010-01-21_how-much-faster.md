How much faster

[Athlete Atypicity on the Edge of Human Achievement: Performances Stagnate after the Last Peak, in 1988](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008800):

> The growth law for the development of top athletes performances > remains unknown in quantifiable sport events. Here we present a growth > model for 41351 best performers from 70 track and field (T&F) and > swimming events and detail their characteristics over the modern > Olympic era. We show that 64% of T&F events no longer improved since > 1993, while 47% of swimming events stagnated after 1990, prior to a > second progression step starting in 2000. Since then, 100% of swimming > events continued to progress. >
> We also provide a measurement of the atypicity for the 3919 best > performances (BP) of each year in every event. The secular evolution > of this parameter for T&F reveals four peaks; the most recent (1988) > followed by a major stagnation. This last peak may correspond to the > most recent successful attempt to push forward human physiological > limits. No atypicity trend is detected in swimming. The upcoming > rarefaction of new records in sport may be delayed by technological > innovations, themselves depending upon economical constraints.
