For the greater good

[The Price of Casino-Like Finance Is Higher Than We Think](http://www.maxineudall.com/2010/01/the-price-of-casinolike-finance-is-higher-than-we-think.html):

On the other hand, [Mike the Mad Biologist](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/12/do_we_need_more_scientists_or.php) asks, [Do We Need More Scientists, or More Jobs for Scientists?](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/12/do_we_need_more_scientists_or.php):

Well, it doesn’t look like financial engineering is going away anytime soon. In fact, I’m not sure that the finance sector of the economy is going to shrink as much as we thought it might last year. But that aside, what’s the point of funneling more math and physics graduates into math and physics instead of finance if they can’t put bread on the table? Or is the issue narrower, specifically the difficulty of getting an academic job? Or perhaps the major dynamic is that science & engineering professions are just really bad at capturing the value they generate for the society as a whole? (though this might be more of a feature than a bug in some ways, as the positive externalities might be what drives productivity gains society-wide)
