The few and the many

[John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/variation/huff-jorde-wade-18000-2010.html) has some commentary on a Nicholas Wade [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/science/19human.html) which previews a new paper on long term effective population size in humans, soon to be out in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/recent) (Wade’s piece states that it’ll be out tomorrow, but it’s PNAS). Wade states:

> They put the number at 18,500 people, but this refers only to breeding individuals, the “effective” population. The actual population would have been about three times as large, or 55,500. >
> … >
> Geneticists have long known that the ancestors of modern humans > numbered as few as 10,000 at some time in the last 100,000 years. The critically low number suggested that some catastrophe, like disease or climate change induced by a volcano, had brought humans close to the brink of extinction. >
> **If the new estimate is correct, however, human population size has been small and fairly constant throughout most of the last million years**, ruling out the need to look for a catastrophe.

Assuming an average census size on the order of 50,000, it seems as if our species stumbled onto a rather “risky” strategy of avoiding extinction. From what I recall conservation biologists start to worry about random stochastic events (e.g., a virulent disease) driving a species to extinction once its census size reaches 1,000. I suppose the fact that we were spread out over multiple continents would have mitigated the risk, but still…. It also brings me back to my [post from yesterday](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2010/01/model-of-history-of-human-misery.php), it seems that for most of human history we are a miserable species on the margins of extinction. For the past 10,000 years we were a miserable species. And now a substantial proportion of us are no long miserable (it seems life is actually much improved from pre-modern Malthusianism outside of Africa and South Asia). If only [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz#Theodicy_and_optimism) could have seen it!
