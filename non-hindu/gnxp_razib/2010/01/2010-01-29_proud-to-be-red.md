Proud to be red

A friend pointed me to this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY39fkmqKBM) clip of a young red-haired man objecting to the term “ginger,” and the opprobrium he’s been subjected to since the *South Park* episode [“Ginger Kids”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Kids) popularized ideas such as the possibility that redheads have no soul. I assume the kid is joking. On the other hand, I have read that red-haired males are at some disadvantage on online dating sites, just like non-white males. Have any readers of the red persuasion ever felt put upon due to their rare pigment status?
