"Cuba of the north"

[Iceland Voters Set to Reject Debt Deal](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/world/europe/06iceland.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

It isn’t is as if the average Icelander didn’t benefit somewhat from influx of money which arrived during the nation’s heyday as a center of international finance. But, I somewhat suspect that the movers & shakers who took risk which yielded massive fortunes are somewhat more comfortable than the average Icelander now. Yes, their paper wealth is not what it was, but they were living far above the median consumption rate anyhow. There is austerity for the masses, and “austerity” for the elite.  
There don’t seem any good solutions here. The elites of Iceland were either crooked or stupid, or some combination of both, during the years of high rolling. Now they’ve left their nation holding the bag. **And this is Iceland.** A tiny Nordic nations which is (was?) characterized by clean government and an efficient elite.
