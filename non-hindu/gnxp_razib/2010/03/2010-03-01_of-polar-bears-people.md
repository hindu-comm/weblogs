Of Polar Bears & People

I have pointed to the fact that mtDNA genetics has suggested that the polar bear is actually a derived lineage of brown bears. And, more specifically, that some extant lineages of brown bears share a more recent common ancestor with polar bears than other brown bears. In other words, brown bears are [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly). Apparently there has been dispute of when the polar bear morph emerged from the brown bears. Luckily polar bears have been resident in a region where the likelihood of preservation of ancient DNA is relatively high. PNAS has a new paper which reports on the extraction of genetic material from ancient polar bear remains. [Complete mitochondrial genome of a Pleistocene jawbone unveils the origin of polar bear](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/02/18/0914266107.abstract):

It turns out that this particular bear is at the root of the tree in relation to the separation between polar bears and the ABC brown bears. That suggests that polar bears began to speciate on the order of \~100,000 years ago, and that their speciation occurred within about 10-30,000 years. Figure 3 shows the relations between modern brown & polar bear populations, and the ancient polar bear:

The relationship between this paper and the stickleback paper should be clear: **ecological change tracks changes in evolution, and in a sense is causal.** The cases of the freshwater sticklebacks and polar bears are somewhat inverted insofar as the cooling opened up opportunities in the case of the latter, and removed them in the former. Additionally, the circumpolar polar bears radiated from a common ancestor and are one genetic species, not localized independently derived ecotypes. In this manner, polar bears are somewhat similar to humans, as is noted in the paper. Our own species seems to have left Africa and spread across the World Island within about 10,000 years, and adaptively radiated.  
If the polar bear goes extinct today, what will happen when the next Ice Age opens up more opportunities? Likely the “polar bear” will reappear, assuming that human intervention does not forestall such evolutionary responses. In fact there may be an eternal recurrence in the cases of bears and sticklebacks over the past few million years of Ice Ages whereby cold adapted morphs emerge, and go extinct, repeatedly. What would happen if all non-African populations were exterminated? Likely Africans would resettle the rest of the world, and de-pigmentation and Bergmann’s would produce lighter populations all around the temperate zones within 10,000 years. The specific details might vary, consider how light skinned populations in Britain and Japan are rather different. It illustrates how evolution is **both contingent and deterministic.**
