Monkeys are more complicated than you'd think

[Generous Leaders and Selfish Underdogs: Pro-Sociality in Despotic Macaques](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009734):

> Actively granting food to a companion is called pro-social behavior > and is considered to be part of altruism. Recent findings show that > some non-human primates behave pro-socially. However, pro-social > behavior is not expected in despotic species, since the steep > dominance hierarchy will hamper pro-sociality. We show that some > despotic long-tailed macaques do grant others access to food. > Moreover, their dominance hierarchy determines pro-social behavior in > an unexpected way: high-ranking individuals grant, while low-ranking > individuals withhold their partner access to food. Surprisingly, > pro-social behavior is not used by subordinates to obtain benefits from dominants, but by dominants to emphasize their dominance position. Hence, Machiavellian macaques rule not through “fear above love”, but through “be feared when needed and loved when possible”.

Probably would be nicer to have more dots on the scatterplot…but that would involve tracking more troops. **Someone needs to pay for more ethologists!**
