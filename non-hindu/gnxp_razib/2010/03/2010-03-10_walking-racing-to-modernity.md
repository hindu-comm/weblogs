Walking & racing to modernity

Two quantitative facts of note from [When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594201854/geneexpressio-20/):  
From page 33:

> Although the passage to modernity universally involves the transition > from an agrarian to service-based society via an industrial one, here > we find another instance of European exceptionalism. European > countries (sixteen in all)…are the only ones in the world that have > been through a phase in which the relative size of industrial > employment was *larger* than either agrarian or service employment. In > Britain, industrial employment reached its peak in 1911, when it > accounted for 52.2 percent of the total labor force…the peak figure > for the United States was 35.8 percent in 1967 and for Japan 37.1 > percent in 1973…From a global perspective, a different and far more common path has been to move directly, in terms of employment, from a largely agrarian to a mainly service society, without a predominantly industrial phase….

From page 103-104:

> …In 1950 79% of South Korea’s population worked in agriculture…by 1960 > the figure was 61%, and today it is it around 10%. In the late 1960s > the farming population still comprised half of Taiwan’s total > population, whereas today it accounts for a mere 8%…In 1950 76% of > Taiwanese lived in the countryside, whereas by 1989…that figure had > been almost exactly reversed…The urban population in South Korea was 18% in 1950 and 80% in 1994…In China the urban population represented 17% of the total population in 1975 and is projected to be 46% by 2015….  
> Compared with Europe, the speed of the shift from the countryside to > the cities is exceptional. Germany’s urban population grew from 15% in > 1850 to 49% in 1910…and 53% in 1950…The equivalent figures for France > were 19% in 1850 and 38% in 1910 (and 68% in 1970). England’s urban > population was 23% in 1800, 45% in 1850, and 75% in 1910. In the > United States, the urban population was 14% in 1850, 42% in 1910, and > 57% in 1950. If we take South Korea as our point of comparison…the > proportion of its population living in cities increased by 62% in 44 > years, compared with 52% for England over a period of 110 years, 34% over 60 years for Germany (and 38% over 100 years), 19% over 60 years for France (and 49% over 120 years), and 28% over 60 years (and 43% over 100 years) for the United States….

The author emphasizes the extreme rapidity of the economic transition from an agricultural economy to a post-industrial one in much of East Asia, with the long slow simmer of the British [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) as a contrast. He points out that the *relative* gradual nature of industrialization in Europe likely explains the historic and antique aspects of its cities; evolutionary change allows for preservation and appreciation of the past, while very rapid economic growth as has been the norm in East Asia since 1950 tends to overturn the old order in its haste. I would suggest though that the ephemeral nature of East Asian architecture, with its dependence on wood, is something which has a deeper historical basis. But in any case, I think it is plausible that the extremely rapid shift from agrarian to post-industrial societies makes East Asians particularly open to novel technologies and fads.  
[When China Rules the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594201854/geneexpressio-20/) is interesting, it occupies a space between [The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684844419/geneexpressio-20/) and [The End of History and the Last Man](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743284550/geneexpressio-20/). The title is a bit hyperbolic, and doesn’t really reflect what’s within. In fact the subtitle is far more an accurate reflection of the content.  
**Note:** The author points out in the book that the Jin Dynasty was Mongol. It was not, it was [Jurchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Dynasty_(1115%E2%80%931234)), the same group which gave rise to the Manchus.
