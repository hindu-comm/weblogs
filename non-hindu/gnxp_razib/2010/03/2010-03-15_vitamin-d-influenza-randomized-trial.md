Vitamin D & influenza – randomized trial

[Randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza A in schoolchildren](http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/ajcn.2009.29094v1):

> Design: From December 2008 through March 2009, we conducted a > randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin > D3 supplements (1200 IU/d) with placebo in schoolchildren. The primary > outcome was the incidence of influenza A, diagnosed with influenza > antigen testing with a nasopharyngeal swab specimen.  
> Results: Influenza A occurred in 18 of 167 (10.8%) children in the > vitamin D3 group compared with 31 of 167 (18.6%) children in the > placebo group \[relative risk (RR), 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.99; P = > 0.04\]. The reduction in influenza A was more prominent in children > who had not been taking other vitamin D supplements (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: > 0.17, 0.79; P = 0.006) and who started nursery school after age 3 y > (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.78; P = 0.005). **In children with a > previous diagnosis of asthma, asthma attacks as a secondary outcome > occurred in 2 children receiving vitamin D3 compared with 12 children > receiving placebo (RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.73; P = 0.006).**

I will attest to improvement in my own respiratory health since I began taking vitamin D supplements in 2007, but more studies need to be done to confirm that this is a robust finding.
