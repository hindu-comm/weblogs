Please change your links

If you have a blog, and you link to <http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/>, I would appreciate it if you switched to <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/>. I know most people don’t use blogrolls much, but it matters for [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), and the archives have been copied so I’d rather have search engine traffic go to the active weblog ASAP. Thanks.
