Whatever happened to "synthetic life"?

I remember Craig Venter talking about synthetic life in the fall of 2007 with Carl Zimmer. Last summer he said that we’d have the first “synthetic species” [by the end of the year](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6804599.ece). I haven’t heard about it in 2010, have you? Anyone have info on what’s going on here? No surprise that project deadlines get pushed back, it happens. But it seems like I’ve been hearing “wait 6 months” since the beginning of 2008. Does it actually work out so that only God can pull this off? Or is this [vaporscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware) (OK, he got the [genome](http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/synthetic-bacterial-genome/press-release/) part nailed down, but that was a while ago)?
