The Evolution of Symbolic Language

[Terrence Deacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Deacon) and [Ursula Goodenough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Goodenough) have written a great article on [*the evolution of symbolic language*](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/03/the_evolution_of_symbolic_lang.html?ft=1&f=114424647). I’m mentioning it because they make two particularly interesting points. First point:

> Language is in effect an > [emergent](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2010/01/emergence_into_the_adjacent_po_2.html) > function, not some prior function that just required fine-tuning. Our > inherited (“instinctive”) vocalizations, such as laughter, shrieks of > fright, and cries of anguish, are under localized, mostly subcortical, > neurological control, as are analogous instinctive vocalizations in > other animals. By contrast, language depends on a widely dispersed > constellation of cortical systems. Each system is also found in other > primate brains, where they engage in other functions; their collective > recruitment for language was apparently driven by the fact that their > previously evolved functions overlapped with particular processing > demands necessitated by language. **Old structures came to perform > unprecedented new tricks.**

Using their own interpretations of previous research into birdsong, they also claim a relaxation of selection pressures may have played a role in the emergence of human language:

> This reduction of emotional and contextual constraint on sound > production opens the door for numerous other influences to play a > role, allowing many more brain systems to participate in vocal > behavior, including socially acquired auditory experience. In fact, > such freedom from constraint is an essential precondition for being > able to correlate learned vocal behaviors with the wide diversity of > objects, events, properties, and relationships that language is > capable of referring to. Hence an evolutionary de-differentiation > process, while clearly not the whole story, may be a part of the story > for symbolic language evolution.
