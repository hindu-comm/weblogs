Culture & genomics

Interesting post, [Culture and the human genome: a synthesis of genetics and the human sciences](http://replicatedtypo.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/culture-and-the-human-genome-a-synthesis-of-genetics-and-the-human-sciences/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingSocialScienceEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Social+Science)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher), at [Replicated Typo](http://replicatedtypo.wordpress.com/). Looks like an interesting blog, not updated that often, but the posts have value-add. Definitely adding to my [RSS](http://replicatedtypo.wordpress.com/feed/) reader. My main complaint about the weblog are the annoying little Snap div pops. Is there anyone out there who thinks those things are awesome?
