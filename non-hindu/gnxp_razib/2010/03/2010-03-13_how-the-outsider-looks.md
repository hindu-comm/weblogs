How the outsider looks

[Heartthrob’s Barbed Blog Challenges China’s Leaders](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/world/asia/13hanhan.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

> Since he began blogging in 2006, Mr. Han has been delivering > increasingly caustic attacks on China’s leadership and the policies he contends are creating misery for those unlucky enough to lack a powerful government post. **With more than 300 million hits to his blog**, he may be the most popular living writer in the world. >
> In a recent interview at his office in Shanghai, he described party > officials as “useless” and prone to spouting nonsense, although he > used more delicate language to dismiss their relevance. “Their lives are nothing like ours,” he said. “The only thing they have in common with young people is that like us, they too have girlfriends in their 20s, although theirs are on the side.”

It looks like internet usage in China may be reaching [400 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users) soon. This may seem a bit of a stretch, but I wonder if someone such as Han Han might be viewed as an heir to the long tradition of Confucian scholars who serve as outsider critics against Imperial regimes they deemed morally unfit.
