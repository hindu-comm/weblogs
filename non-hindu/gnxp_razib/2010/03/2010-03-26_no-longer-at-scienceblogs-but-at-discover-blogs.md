No longer at ScienceBlogs, but at Discover Blogs

Many of you already know this, but I’ve moved from [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) to [Discover Blogs](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/). There isn’t much to say about this, I had a good run at ScienceBlogs, but Discover Blogs offers some new opportunities. All that matters for you is this, **please update your bookmarks and/or RSS feeds:**

**Bookmarks:** <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp>

**RSS feed:** <http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeneExpressionBlog>

Also, remember my “total feed,” which covers all the blogs. I also added my occasional *Comment is Free* pieces to the feed: <http://www.razib.com/wordpress/?feed=rss2>. I also publish this to my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/razibkhan), but there’s other stupid stuff there that you might want to avoid.

If you have a weblog that links to ScienceBlogs GNXP, I would appreciate you update the link for the same of PageRank.

Finally, I probably will be posting here far less for the indefinite future. While I was at ScienceBlogs there was a tacit understanding that I’d put the less science-oriented stuff here, the historical essays and what not. I don’t really have time to juggle too many blogs anymore, so I’m going to focus on Discover Blogs. In the future I have some ideas about making this domain more of a “user generated” website or an aggregator, but it is formative at this point. Since there are others who contribute to GNXP as a group weblog that feature will continue for the foreseeable future. But in two years I will have had this domain for a whole decade, and all endeavours go through life cycles.

P.S. [Edmund Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience) of [Not Exactly Rocket Science](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience) is also moving; kind of like Diasporic Chindia I guess….
