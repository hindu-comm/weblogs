RSS feed

I notice that not too many people seem to have switched from the old feed to the new. Part of the issue is that many people have subscriptions which they never check or have forgotten. But in case you’re reading this on the old feed, that’s because the techs are currently pointing the old feed to the new. But at some point this will not occur, and you’ll need the new feed. So if you haven’t, please switch to:

<http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeneExpressionBlog>

Danke.
