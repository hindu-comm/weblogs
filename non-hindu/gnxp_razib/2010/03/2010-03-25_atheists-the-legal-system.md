Atheists and the legal system

This [article](http://www.astcweb.org/public/publication/article.cfm/1/22/2/America-Hates-Atheists) at [The Jury Expert](http://www.astcweb.org/public/publication/article.cfm/1/22/2/America-Hates-Atheists) serves as a nice review of literature. Hereâ€™s their summary:

> Atheists are unique and individual (just like all of us) and we have > to attend to the attitudes, beliefs and life experiences that all of > us (even atheists) bring to the table as jurors. Conversely, jurors > need to be reminded, if they know they are judging an atheist, **that > they are human**, American, and as deserving of thoughtful > consideration as we all are. Do you want atheists on your particular > jury? It depends. As we mentioned earlier, you probably donâ€™t want a > militant atheistâ€“like most militants they are likely too unpredictable > and a potentially polarizing force in the deliberation room. (We have > seen occasions where juriesâ€“and even focus groupsâ€“have begun their > deliberations with a group prayer. Many atheists (and others) would be > very uncomfortable about this, of course, and resistance might have a > strong impact on the deliberative process. Of course, if you want a > contentious deliberation or a hung jury you may choose to inject a > militant atheist, but we arenâ€™t getting into that for this article.) >
> Most important, maintain an awareness of the intense bias atheism > arouses in most Americans, and remember that all bias stems from > beliefs, and the trigger is not always a characteristic visible to the > eye.

Yes. We are human ðŸ™‚
