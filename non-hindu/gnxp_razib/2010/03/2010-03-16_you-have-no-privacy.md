You have no privacy

[How Privacy Vanishes Online](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/technology/17privacy.html?hp). Pretty banal actually. Social networking has really changed things. As I’ve said before I’m fascinated by the large number of people who, even those who want to be anonymous, enter in their real email addresses when leaving a comment. There seems a default “trust unless you shouldn’t trust” setting, so we naively input our information assuming it isn’t being mined by someone. In any case, a bigger issue in the future I think will be stupid government officials who scan up documents which they shouldn’t scan up. It’s happened a few times so far, but I think it’ll get worse in this decade.
