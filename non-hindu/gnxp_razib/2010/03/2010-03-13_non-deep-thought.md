Non-deep thought

Weâ€™ll never have utopia. A world in which in many nations it is normal for the poor to be fat *is*, is a utopia by any measure from the perspective of someone who lived in 1900. Prompted to think about this after listening to part of this diavlog between [a transhumanist and Massimo Pigluicci](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/26683). Sometimes I think the ideal futurist wold be someone with a background in evolutionary biology, economics/economic history **and** engineering.
