Personal genomics is dead, long live personal genomics

The [Andrew Pollack](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/20consumergene.html?pagewanted=print) [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/20consumergene.html?pagewanted=print) which I hinted at came out a few days ago: [Consumers Slow to Embrace the Age of Genomics](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/business/20consumergene.html?pagewanted=print). For what itâ€™s worth, I think this chart from [Dr. Daniel MacArthur](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/03/the_end_is_nigh_for_23andme.php) is right on:  
![](https://i0.wp.com/scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/wiki_hype-cycle.jpg?w=640)![](https://i0.wp.com/scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/wiki_hype-cycle.jpg?w=640)  
This too will pass. I believe that like the internet the knowledge and analysis of our genetic information is going to be ubiquitous after a rough period when most of the dreams of grandeur from the first generation entrepreneurs fade.
