Disqus and Echo

I’m starting to see [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) and [Echo](http://js-kit.com/) all over the web. Anyone else notice this? I wasn’t happy when I had to move [Gene Expression Classic](https://www.gnxp.com/) off Haloscan, so the whole “death of comments” fad isn’t something I’m a fan of. But it seems like Facebook’s creation of a successful private web is now driving the Facebookification of the public web. The main issue I have with all this revolution of the “discussion” is that in my experience as a blogger **most “discussion” is retarded** and most discussants are barely sentient.
