Lactase persistence and BMI – milk does a body fat?

As you know lactase persistence (LP), which confers the ability to digest lactose sugar as an adult, is an evolutionarily recent development. On the order of 1/3 of the human population exhibits LP, due to a variety of genetic mutations which seem to arise in the cultural background of the domestication of cattle. Some have asked about the possible associations between LP & height & weight before. A new paper in *Human Molecular Genetics* looks at just that, [European lactase persistence genotype shows evidence of association with increase in body mass index](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/6/1129):

> The global prevalence of obesity has increased significantly in recent > decades, mainly due to excess calorie intake and increasingly > sedentary lifestyle. Here, we test the association between obesity > measured by body mass index (BMI) and one of the best-known genetic > variants showing strong selective pressure: the functional variant in > the cis-regulatory element of the lactase gene. We tested this variant > since it is presumed to provide nutritional advantage in specific > physical and cultural environments.

In this study, we highlight issues in model selection in the genome-wide association studies and problems in imputation of these special genomic regions.

They focused primarily on Finnish cohorts, but also looked as some other populations, in addition to performing a [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis). Here’s a figure which shows the various beta-values combined with the confidence intervals around them by study:

It turns out that in some of their populations *LCT* explains about the same proportion of the variance in BMI as *FTO*, an “obesity gene.” The discussion goes into why *LCT* might have been picked up in earlier studies:

It doesn’t look like there are common variants of large effect size. The best they could find was that *LCT* explained \~0.2% of the BMI variance, with a 1 kg & 0.3 kg/m² higher BMI across the two classes. They also observe in the study that **height is not predicted in many modern populations once you correct for population stratification** (that is, correct for ethnic origin. Though in the case of many very tall populations, and East Asian populations, I assume they are monomorphic in phenotype). I specify modern because I suspect the phenotypic correlations between LP & the genes which control it would have been very different 4,000 years ago in Denmark, when the LP conferring genotypes were probably at much lower frequencies, and nutritional substitutions for raw milk were less abundant.
