A little bit of the Others in Us

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/03/abstracts-from-aapa-2010.html) has reposted some of the abstracts from the meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. This one caught my eye, \<b*Genetic analyses reveal a history of serial founder effects, admixture between long separated founding populations in Oceania, and interbreeding with archaic humans*:

> Genetic anthropologists continue to debate whether human neutral > genetic variation primarily reflects a continuum of demes connected by > local gene flow or colonization and serial founder effects. A second > unresolved issue concerns the genetic contribution of archaic species > to the modern human gene pool. Some studies suggest that this > contribution was substantial and that it played an important role in > human adaptation. These issues remain unresolved because of > inadequacies and biases in datasets, problems in statistical > methodology, and the failure to recognize that different evolutionary > processes may produce similar outcomes. This study redresses these > limitations by analyzing gene identity within and between populations > in a dataset comprised of 614 STRs assayed in 1,983 people from 99 > widespread populations. Our strategy is to fit hierarchical models to > these data and examine residual deviations from the models. Each model > involves nesting smaller units such as populations into larger units > such as continental regions. It is possible to restate many of these > models as either expansions or reductions of each other and thereby > identify aspects of population structure that have had a major impact > on the overall pattern of diversity. The strong fit of a model > estimated using the Neighbor Joining algorithm indicates that human > genetic diversity primarily reflects a history of successive founder > effects associated with our exodus from Africa, not a continuum of > demes connected by gene flow. Residual deviations from the model > suggest: 1) the genomes of Oceanic peoples are the product of two independent waves of migration to the region and admixture, and **2) genetic exchange occurred between archaic and modern humans after their initial divergence.**

Would be nice if they found a gene which was likely differentiated between archaic and modern alleles, but it doesnâ€™t look like that. But the number of populations seems rather large.
