Doing evolution's sums

*PLoS Biology* has a review of [Elements of Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0981519423/geneexpressio-20/) up, [Evolution Is a Quantitative Science](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000381):

> But why has evolutionary genetics stood apart from biologyâ€™s > resolutely qualitative, rather than quantitative, tradition? Most > remarkably, while biomechanics employs the laws of physics, and > biochemistry is founded on the quantitative science of chemistry, > evolutionary genetics is based on axiomatic foundations that are > entirely biological, and yet are capable of precise mathematical > formulation. The rules of Mendelian genetics, encapsulated by unbiased > inheritance and random mating in a diploid genetic system, predict > Hardy-Weinberg frequencies, the binomial sampling of gametes in finite > populations determines the properties of genetic drift, and, with a > Poisson process of mutation, the complex theory of neutral genetic > variation can be established on the basis of very simple assumptions.

A few books to get a historical perspective of the origins of modern evolutionary genetics (albeit with a pop gen focus), [The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684644/geneexpressio-20/), [Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684733/geneexpressio-20/) and [R.A. Fisher: The Life of a Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471093009/geneexpressio-20/).
