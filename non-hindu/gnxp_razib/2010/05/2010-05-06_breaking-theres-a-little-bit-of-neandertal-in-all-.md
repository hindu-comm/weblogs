Breaking: there's a little bit of Neandertal in all of us

[We’re all a bit of a Neanderthal](http://www.herald.ie/national-news/city-news/were-all-a-bit-of-a-neanderthal-2167136.html):

> As a result, **between 1pc \[percent\] and 4pc of the DNA of > non-African people alive today is Neanderthal**, according to the > research. The discovery emerged from the first attempt to map the > complete Neanderthal genetic code, or genome. It more or less settles > a long-standing academic debate over interbreeding between separate > branches of the human family tree. Evidence in the past has pointed > both ways, for and against modern humans and Neanderthals mixing their > genes. >
> … >
> Prof Svante Paabo, of the Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in > Leipzig, Germany, said: “Those of us who live outside Africa carry a > little Neanderthal DNA in us.”

As I said, this is a story of genomics, not just genetics. 1-4% is not trivial. [The Daily Telegraph](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/dna-proves-we-had-sex-with-neanderthals/story-e6frev00-1225863206105) has more:

> They were surprised to find that Neanderthals were more closely > related to modern humans from outside Africa than to Africans. >
> Even more mysteriously, the relationship extended to people from > eastern Asia and the western Pacific – even though no Neanderthal > remains have been found outside Europe and western Asia. >
> The most likely explanation is that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens > interbred before early modern humans struck out east, taking traces of > Neanderthal with them in their genes. >
> Professor Svante Paabo, director of evolutionary genetics at the Max > Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, > who led the international project, said: “Since we see this pattern in > all people outside Africa, not just the region where Neanderthals > existed, we speculate that this happened in some population of modern > humans that then became the ancestors of all present-day non-Africans. >
> “The most plausible region is in the Middle East, where the first > modern humans appeared before 100,000 years ago and where there were > Neanderthals until at least 60,000 years ago. >
> “Modern humans that came out of Africa to colonise the rest of the > world had to pass through that region.” >
> … >
> Several genes were discovered that differed between Neanderthals and > Homo sapiens and may have played important roles in the evolution of > modern humans. >
> **They included genes involved in mental functions, metabolism, and > development of the skull, collar bone and rib cage.**
