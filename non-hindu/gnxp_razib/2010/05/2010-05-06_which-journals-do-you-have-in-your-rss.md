Which journals do you have in your RSS?

I don’t subscribe to *Science* or *Nature*‘s RSS feeds because I assume if there’s something of interest to me, I’ll hear about it when it comes out. But I do subscribe to the RSS feeds of more obscure journals of interest (e.g., *THe American Journal of Human Genetics*). What journals do you subscribe to which don’t have such a higher profile?
