Daily Data Dump (Monday)

[Quiz: Who’s that celebrity mom?](http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/05/07/celebrity.moms.quiz/index.html?hpt=C2) I got a 7 out of 10. I only knew one of the answers for a fact, but the resemblance was obvious in many cases (compare Reese Witherspoon’s mom’s jaw line to Reese).

[The Moral Life of Babies](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/magazine/09babies-t.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=print). It’s complicated. And contra Freud babies aren’t necessarily perverts.

[College Inc.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/collegeinc/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&utm_medium=grid&utm_source=grid), a documentary about the for-profit diploma mills. As I’ve noted before, these institutions of higher education seem geared toward capturing federal dollars through grants and student loans by duping the less intelligent segments of the population into thinking that they can get a college degree. Many conservatives assume that the market can work miracles and produce firms which can educate the uneducable. Demand must be met by supply. Many liberals believe that everyone should have a college education and that everyone has the capability. The real problem is in secondary school.

[E.U. Details \$957 Billion Rescue Package](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/business/global/10drachma.html?hp=&pagewanted=print). Europeans trying to prevent Götterdämmerung.

[African population structure and Neandertal population mixture](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/african-population-structure-neandertal-mixture-2010.html). A reply to those who argue that the 1-4% in Eurasians which is not in African is actually ancient (or present) African substructure.
