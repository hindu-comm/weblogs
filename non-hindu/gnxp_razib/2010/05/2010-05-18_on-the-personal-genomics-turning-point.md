On the personal genomics turning point

From fantasy to fact? [Personal Genomics, tipping points and a personal perspective](http://blog.openhelix.eu/?p=4381&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+openhelix/GhpE+(The+OpenHelix+Blog)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher):

> But now I think we’ve turned a corner. It feels, to mix metaphors, > that we’ve hit a tipping point. The Human genome project, the mapping > and sequencing of the/a human genome from 1990 to 2003, cost > approximately 2,700,000,000 dollars (that’s 2.7 billion, I wanted to > get all the zeros in). Celera did the genome for 300,000,000. The cost > of sequencing an entire human genome has been plummeting ever since. > In 2007, the cost of sequencing the genome of James Watson (co-discoverer of DNA) was about 2,000,000. The today cost is about 10,000. Complete Genomics and other companies are on the march to quickly reducing the cost of sequencing a genome under 1,000.

> **So, within a year, the cost of sequencing your, my, genome will > reach 1,000. If not less.** We’ve seen this coming for years now, and it’s upon us. But what does it mean? A lot of data. But data means nothing without context and analysis. Sequencing my genome would be a waste of 1,000 dollars if I gleaned nothing from it.

I can believe that we’ll be able to get a [tarball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarball) with our own full sequence for a reasonable price in a few years. Cheaper than orthodontia and cosmetic surgery even. Though the utility in prevention and treatment is a different matter. Most people already have a treasure trove of data through family history, and that doesn’t seem to change behavior for many in the short-term. Once the magical power of genomics wears off I suspect that knowing you have variant X with risk Y will be less transformative than not.
