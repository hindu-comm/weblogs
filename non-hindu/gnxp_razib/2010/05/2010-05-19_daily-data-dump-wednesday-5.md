Daily Data Dump (Wednesday)

[Insulin Signaling and Dietary Restriction Differentially Influence the Decline of Learning and Memory with Age](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000372?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosbiology/NewArticles+(PLoS+Biology:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher). I’d be curious what people who practice dietary restriction would say (I know many scientists do this, so it isn’t just quacks).

[Spicing the Meat Also Cuts the Cancer Risk, Research Suggests](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100518105801.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). Spicy foods have antioxidants.

[Punishing Cheaters Promotes the Evolution of Cooperation](http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2010/05/punishing_cheaters.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). The big long-term issue is how to explain complex societies from their basic atomic units and elementary dynamics.

[Why Science Journals Need to Move to Online Only Publishing](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2010/05/why_science_journals_need_to_m.php?utm_source=selectfeed&utm_medium=rss). Fair enough, but sometimes the constraints of a print format do impose some discipline.

[Massachusetts: Student Accused of Faking His Way Into Harvard](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/education/18brfs-STUDENTACCUS_BRF.html?ref=todayspaper). Sounds like a sociopath, though perhaps a touch on the arrogant and dumb side.
