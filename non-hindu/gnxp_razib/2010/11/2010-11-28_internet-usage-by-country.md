Internet usage by country

In my [post below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/taking-the-end-of-the-age-seriously/) on the rise of China, I ran into the data on internet usage by country again. I was online regularly by the spring of 1995, and itâ€™s amazing to think that there are hundreds of millions of Chinese on the internet now! The World Bank estimates that both China and India have exhibited an increase of internet usage by an order of magnitude from 2000-2010, though from different bases. So while there are \~300 million Chinese users of the internet, there are \~50 million Indians. But who would have guessed that Nigeria has more per capita internet users than India? See below.

Now check out this plot of more advanced economies of internet penetration by % of households vs. income per capita.
