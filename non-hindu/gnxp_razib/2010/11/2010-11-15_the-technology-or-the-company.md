The technology or the company?

[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/15/facebook-messaging/) is reporting on Facebook’s new [“modern messaging system”](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/15/facebook-messaging/). The first few comments immediately telegraphed my first impression: **is this Facebook’s Google Wave?** Interesting then to see if Facebook can make this work. If it can’t, then score one for the proposition that people don’t want a seamless integration of various tools which emerged in the 1990s and have distinctive roles today in the information ecology (IM, email, message boards, etc.). If Facebook succeeds perhaps it goes to show the importance of timing, execution and marketing. On the other hand, [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/11/15/facebook-messaging-event/) makes MMS sound just like a souped-up version of SMS texting, and so far less ambitious in scope than Wave ever was. Email *is* more formal, which is why it can be very useful in some situations. Facebook is more convenient for getting in touch with your college roommate.
