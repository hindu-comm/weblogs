The future Indian Yao Ming

In a nation of \~1 billion, even one where a large minority are positively malnourished, you’d expect some really tall people. So not that surprising:[NBA Awaits Satnam From India, So Big and Athletic at 14](http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/11/10/nba-awaits-satnam-from-india-so-big-and-athletic-at-14/):

> In a country of 1.3 billion people, 7-foot, 250-pound Satnam Singh Bhamar has become a beacon for basketball hope. >
> At age 14. >
> … >
> That potential starts with his size, which is incredible itself. At > age 14, he is expected to grow for another couple of years. For now, he wears a size-22 basketball shoe. His hands swallow the ball. His father, Balbir Singh Bhamara, is 7-2. **His grandmother on his father’s side is 6-9.**

Punjab is one of [India’s more prosperous states](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/01/when-wealth-doesnt-matter-for-height-south-asia-africa/). Interestingly this kid’s paternal grandmother is as tall in standard deviation units as her son or grandson. In Western developed societies height is 80-90% heritable. That means that there’s very little *expected* regression back to the population mean for any given child. The article doesn’t mention the mother’s height though. If she is of more normal size then Satnam is either a fluke, or, there are dominant large effect rare alleles being passed down by the father, perhaps from the paternal grandmother.
