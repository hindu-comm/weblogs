Size doesn't always matter

Neandertals famously had larger cranial capacities than modern humans, and, have gone through multiple phases of de- and re-humanization. A few weeks ago there was a [revision](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/10/19/evidence-of-smart-jewelry-making-neanderthals-is-challenged/) of the idea that Neandertals in France \~30,000 years ago adopted some aspects of modern human culture through diffusion. This was a support for the Neandertal “ooga-booga” thesis. In contrast last spring we were treated to the possibility that [most human beings have trace but non-trivial Neandertal ancestry](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/the-three-layers-of-the-neandertal-cake/). This naturally made Neandertals seem a little less primitive, since we don’t like to perceive ourselves as primitive.

A [new article](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(10)01282-0) in *Current Biology* supports the position for the primitive Neanderal, [Brain development after birth differs between Neanderthals and modern humans](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(10)01282-0):

> Neanderthals had brain sizes comparable to modern humans, but their > brain cases were elongated and not globular as in Homo sapiens…It has, > therefore, been suggested that modern humans and Neanderthals reached > large brain sizes along different evolutionary pathways…Here, we > assess when during development these adult differences emerge. This is > critical for understanding whether differences in the pattern of brain > development might underlie potential cognitive differences between > these two closely related groups. Previous comparisons of Neanderthal > and modern human cranial development have shown that many > morphological characteristics separating these two groups are already > established at the time of birth…and that the subsequent developmental patterns of the face are similar, though not identical…**Here, we show that a globularization phase seen in the neurocranial development of modern humans after birth is absent from Neanderthals.**

In other words there are developmental differences between Neandertals and modern humans. They’re a little less circumspect in the text, “We find that the modern human pattern of brain development is **derived** compared to Neanderthals.” The implication here is that the Neandertals exhibit the ancestral pattern, in common with chimpanzees. Below is figure 1, which summarizes their results:
