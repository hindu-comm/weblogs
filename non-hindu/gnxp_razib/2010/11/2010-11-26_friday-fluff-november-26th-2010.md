Friday Fluff – November 26th, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Innate social aptitudes of man](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/02/innate-social-aptitudes-of-man/).

2\. **Weird search query of the week**: ‘evolutionary biologist studies porn.’

3\. **Comment of the week**, in response to [The cult of Korea](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/7938/comment-page-1/#comment-51968):

> Razib, as you say they are literate, but not in a free way. Note that > I didn’t say North Koreans were illiterate, just that their ignorance > reminds me of places where people are illiterate. The issue isn’t > being theoretically able to read but rather being able to find > information and be skeptical. I could have made that clearer. After > all there are lots of literate fundamentalists who aren’t skeptically > literate. However being illiterate in places like Afghanistan or Haiti > makes the situation that much worse. Being literate but not reading > through choice (as with some Americans) or through restrictions > (countries like N. Korea) ends up largely being a difference without > much of a difference in terms of results. >
> Omar, most groups are informed about what they encounter regularly. > (Although even there one finds a lot of nonsense – look at water > dowsing in the US) Outside of that experience though they are ill > informed and typically open to a high level of nonsense. I don’t think > indoctrination vs. ignorance really captures what I’m getting at. > Someone may be bright but unable to think through issues critically. > Of course that can happen here in the US as well. There’s no shortage > of urban legends Americans believe. But in places like North Korea, > Haiti or many other places the lack of access/ability to read about > the world leads to huge problems. The problem is that when leaders try > to manipulate the public and enflame them they can quickly lose > control precisely because of this problem. >
> But as you both note, one should distinguish literacy from ignorance. >
> BTW – I don’t think Cuba is a good analogy to N. Korea. While the US > has had a travel ban others have been able to go to Cuba and interact > with people widely. (Canadians were quite positively viewed by the > Cubans and it wasn’t hard to go on vacation there) Further consumer > goods were a little more widely dispersed in Cuba along with telecasts > and radio from the US. (I’m not sure how much exposure to S. Korean > media N. Koreans have as a practical matter) I’m not playing down > Castro and what he did, but I think it gets a mite bit exaggerated in > the US. On the other hand N. Korea is a whole other world from what I > can tell. Cuba I think most of us would recognize, even if we chaffed > under the restrictions in say the 80’s.

4\) Are we going through the Great Stagnation?
