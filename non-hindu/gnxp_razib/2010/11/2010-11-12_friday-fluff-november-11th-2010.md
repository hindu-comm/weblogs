Friday Fluff – November 12th, 2010

![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)![FF3](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2010/09/FF3.png?resize=600%2C100)

1\. First, a **post from the past**: [Extremism in defense of precision is no vice](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/05/why-the-gods-will-not-be-defeated/).

2\. **Weird search query of the week**: ‘”it’s a jersey thing” gnxp.’

3\. **Comment of the week**, in response to [Tariffs, not trade?](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/tariffs-not-trade/#comment-49975):

> You’re ignoring intergenerational wealth transfer. Grandparents don’t > like to see their grandchildren’s parents out of work, or forced to > move out of state to find work. They don’t like to see their former > workplaces (whether GM or “Main street” shops) “diminished” by > competition from cheap imports.

4\) How do you feel about the fact that the *raison d’etre* of many public libraries is becoming their internet service?

5\) And finally, your weekly **fluff fix**: a little different. Check out [how cats lap milk](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol0/issue2010/images/data/science.1195421/DC1/1195421s1.mov) from the recent *Science* [paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1195421).
