Open Thread – November 20th, 2010

A friend pointed me to [Mapping the Measure of America](http://www.measureofamerica.org/maps/). It allows for the creation of maps really quickly without any nerd-grease needed.

West Virginia’s 13th Congressional District has the lowest life expectancy in the USA at birth at 73.93 years. Median income is \$23,200. 13.8% have university degrees or higher. In contrast, New York’s 16th Congressional District has a life expectancy of 79.03 years, a median income of \$17,800 dollars, and is 66.6% Latino (presumably mostly Puerto Rican since it is in the Bronx). Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, north of Atlanta, has a life expectancy of 79.06 years. Median income is \$40,800. It is 72% white, 10% black, 10% Latino, and 7% Asian. Texas’s 15th Congressional District has a median income of \$19,700, and a life expectancy of 80.72 years. It is 81% Latino. 15% have university degrees or higher.

Below is a map which shows the proportion lacking private health insurance by district:
