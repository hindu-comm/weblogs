30,000 full human genomes by January 1st, 2012?

That seems to be the inference one can make from this thorough [article](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101027/full/4671026a.html) in *Nature*, [Human genome: Genomes by the thousand](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101027/full/4671026a.html). Last [summer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/07/genomic-liftoff/#more-4871) I pointed to a projection of \~50,000 in 2011. *Nature*‘s current tally is \~3,000 genomes sequenced. Though issues of [accuracy](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/the-genomics-future-is-almost-now/comment-page-1/#comment-47105) are still important to remember, it’s pretty striking isn’t it only 10 years on from the Human Genome Project how far we’ve come? **Over a one year period there will be a shift of about an order of magnitude.** Though that may be a drop off from 2009-2010, which is likely to have been [two orders of magnitude](http://www.eyeondna.com/2009/09/21/people-whove-had-their-genomes-sequenced/). Totally not rational, but I’m feeling a touch lame at only having [500,000 SNPs](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/10/my-dodecad-results/) done.

Below are the charts from last summer….
