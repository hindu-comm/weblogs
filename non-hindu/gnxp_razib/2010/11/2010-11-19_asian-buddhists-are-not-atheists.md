Asian Buddhists are not atheists

In response to my [two](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/most-atheists-are-not-white/) [posts](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/11/sex-differences-in-global-atheism-part-n/) below on atheism statistics, people in the comments and around the web (e.g., Facebook) have pointed out that Buddhism is necessarily/can be atheistic, and that Buddhism, is not/not necessarily a religion, and therefore that explains the statistics. Some of these people are lazy/stupid judging by the way the argument is delivered, but they are clearly grounded in a reality which is expressed in books and documentaries which introduce people to Buddhism. There is a small issue which confounds this analysis of the atheism statistics: **most East Asians do not identify as Buddhist.** This is mostly because most citizens of the People’s Republic of China do not identify with Buddhism. That being said, Buddhism is clearly the dominant organized religion historically in many East Asian nations (though that has not been true in South Korea for the past generation). I reject the equivalence between the role of Catholicism in much of Europe and that of Buddhism in East Asia (the Church was a much more powerful, prestigious, and influential institution than the Buddhist *sangha* with only a few exceptional periods), but it can be argued that these are Buddhist cultures, just as they are Confucian societies.

But there’s a bigger issue with this objection: **most Asians who identify as Buddhist are [themselves theists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/04/asian-buddhists-believe-in-god/).** This is also the [case for American Buddhists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/06/buddhists-do-believe-in-god/). Some people have objected that *theism* in a Buddhist context is not equivalent to theism in a Hindu, and especially Abrahamic sense. There is no creator god obviously. That is fine, but I think it is important to point out that no matter the theological details of their beliefs, **most Buddhists do seem to accept the existence of supernatural entities which we would term “gods.”** I was aware of this personally because I’ve encountered several people of Chinese origin who tell me that they’re Buddhist, they believe in god, when I tell them I’m an atheist (usually in response to the question about whether I am Muslim).

The previous question as to whether someone was a “Religious person,” “Not a religious person,” or a “Convinced atheist,” can be broken down by religion. I did so. Below are the data for Buddhists alone. I also provided the sample size for Buddhists. The overall N’s were on the order of 1,000-2,000. So you can see that only a small minority (5% actually) of Chinese in the People’s Republic identify as Buddhists. The other values are obviously percentages.
