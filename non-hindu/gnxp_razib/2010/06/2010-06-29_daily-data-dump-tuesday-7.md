Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

[North America’s First Peoples More Genetically Diverse Than Thought, Mitochondrial Genome Analysis Reveals](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100628170926.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)). The [paper is free to all](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2010/06/24/gr.109231.110.abstract). Remember that this is just mtDNA, the maternal lineage. This area seems a bit confused now. The standard simple model, which is barely even a ‘stylized fact’ at this point, is that a group of Siberians arrived \~12,000 years ago and this founder population to led to all that has come after. For about twenty years geneticists have been claiming to see more time depth, but that’s confused by the possibility that they have been looking at evolutionary dynamics in Berengia, not North America.

[In Ireland, a Picture of the High Cost of Austerity](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/business/global/29austerity.html). So was there an alternative to austerity for Ireland alone? Can such a small nation pump growth with deficit spending if its larger neighbors are all beating the drum for austerity? Seems like they’re soldiering on and making the best of a bad situation.

[In Faulty-Computer Suit, Window to Dell Decline](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html). *Dude*, do not buy a Dell!

[The Triumphant Decline of the WASP](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28feldman.html?pagewanted=print). Noah Feldman basically concedes that WASPs are the world’s least primitive population. Of course that does not entail fitness of genes or memes.

[Can linguistic features reveal time depths as deep as 50,000 years ago?](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/linguistics/can-linguistic-features-reveal-time-depths-as-deep-as-50000-years-ago) Mostly likely not.
