Cuckoldry more common in past generations

We have [some data](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/your-generation-was-sluttier.php) that in fact older generations were more sexually promiscuous, contrary to the moral panic perpetually ascendant. As a follow up to my [previous post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/the-paternity-myth-the-rarity-of-cuckoldry/), there is some scholarship which suggests that misattributed paternity rates have been *declining*. [Recent decline in nonpaternity rates: a cross-temporal meta-analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19320216):

> Nonpaternity (i.e., discrepant biological versus social fatherhood) > affects many issues of interests to psychologists, including familial > dynamics, interpersonal relationships, sexuality, and fertility, and > therefore represents an important topic for psychological research. > The advent of modern contraceptive methods, particularly the market > launch of the birth-control pill in the early 1960s and its increased > use ever since, should have affected rates of nonpaternity (i.e., > discrepant genetic and social fatherhood). This cross-temporal > meta-analysis investigated whether there has been a recent decline in > nonpaternity rates in the western industrialized nations. The eligible > database comprised 32 published samples unbiased towards nonpaternity > for which nonoverlapping data from more than 24,000 subjects from nine > (mostly Anglo-Saxon heritage) countries with primarily Caucasian > populations are reported. Publication years ranged from 1932 to 1999, > and estimated years of the reported nonpaternity events (i.e., the > temporal occurrence of nonpaternity) ranged from 1895 to 1993. In > support of the hypothesis, weighted meta-regression models showed a > significant decrease (r = -.41) of log-transformed nonpaternity rates > with publication years and also a decrease, albeit not significant (r > = -.17), with estimated years of nonpaternity events. **These results > transform into an estimated absolute decline in untransformed > nonpaternity rates of 0.83% and 0.91% per decade, respectively. Across > studies, the mean (and median) nonpaternity rate was 3.1% (2.1%).** > This estimate is consistent with estimates of 2 to 3% from recent > reviews on the topic that were based on fewer primary studies. This > estimate also rebuts the beliefs and hearsay data widespread among > both the public and researchers which contend nonpaternity rates in > modern populations might be as high as about 10%.

I don’t have academic access, so I can’t say much more than that (if someone wants to email me the paper, contactgnxp -at – gmail -dot- com will work). Obviously I don’t think this is implausible on the face it; the “good old days” were often a lot less “good” than we remember (or what our elders remember and tell us).

**Addendum:** If you are from the cuckold enthusiast community, yes, I am aware that your perspective on whether the good old days were good may differ….
