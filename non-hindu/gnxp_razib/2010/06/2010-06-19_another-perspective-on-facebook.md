Another perspective on Facebook

From [Ruchira Paul](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2010/06/who-are-your-friends-and-how-many-should-you-have.html), who analyzes her own friend network. One issue which I think is relevant is that many people have several Facebook accounts for several different purposes. It’s an interesting window into the psychology of different individuals, as some seem happy to go along with Facebook’s preference of a unitary identity, while others resist it and suborn the intent with Facebook itself.
