Daily Data Dump – Tuesday

[Sexual urges overcome cultural taboo](http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/mindelle_jacobs/2010/06/21/14469481.html). So it turns out that the female children of immigrants from conservative societies (South Asian and Islamic) are paying for hymen restoration surgeries. The more interesting question would be if these children become sexually conservative themselves, perpetuating the life history trajectory so that their own children have to go through these sorts of reconstructions.

[Vitamin D Deficiency Due To Genetic Variants](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/007268.html). Vitamin D supplementation is all the rage right now. What if its efficacy and necessity is conditional on genetic background?

[Is the “missing heritability” right under our noses?](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/genetics/is-the-missing-heritability-right-under-our-noses?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+GeneExpression+(Gene+Expression)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher) The issue may have to do with the exigencies of research programs, not a deep scientific mystery.

[A Singular Kind of Eugenics](http://www.biopoliticaltimes.org/article.php?id=5260). It seems “privilege” is the new hot-button for Lefties who are skeptical of assisted reproductive technologies and genetic modifications. I suspect it’s a Left-wing buzzword which is equivalent to Righties who bring up “dignity” or the “wisdom of repugnance.” Much easier than having to generate clear prose and understand the complex motives which underpin an issue. Buying really expensive smartphones and pure entertainment machines like iPads also are manifestations of privilege. So what distinguishes X from Y? Not the commonality, privilege, but perhaps the same gut intuitions which Right bioconservatives are willing to man up to, repugnance. Some privileges are repugnant (biological interventions) and some frivolous (iPad). Also, when did discourse replace discussion and privilege replace class?

[Saltie Makes a Sandwich Almost Entirely Out of Lettuce](http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2010/06/saltie_makes_a_sandwich_almost.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+nymag/grubstreet+(Grub+Street+-+nymag.com's+Food+and+Restaurant+Blog)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher). There is nothing magical about meat; it’s all about the flavor.
