PCA plots and trees

A few years ago I had the pleasure of asking the famed geneticist [L. L. Cavalli-Sforza](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/08/10-questions-for-luigi-luca-cavalli.php) some questions. Here’s part of the Q & A which is germane to my [post from a few days ago](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/05/beyond-visualization-of-data-in-genetics/):

PCA plots show you variation that occurs in a correlated fashion across a set of genes. In other words, they’re large systematic signals within the sea of noise genetic variation. They can tell us a great deal, in concert with other techniques, about the history of our species, and the nature and extent of the relationship between populations within in our species. The reason that there is correlated variation across a subset of genes which are highly informative in regards to population identity is simple: **human population groups generally have a common shared history.** They have been subject to the same evolutionary dynamics, and those dynamics, from drift to selection, have particular effects on the nature of genomic variation (or lack thereof).

My point in my previous post was to emphasize that this information needs to be integrated into the bigger picture in a nuanced fashion. Broad systematic population wide patterns of variation, and between population variation, is important, and of great evolutionary interest. But the genetic uniqueness *within families*, from recent unique *de novo* mutations (operationally, family scale private alleles), is also of great interest and importance. PCA plots such as the ones above are naturally not going to tell us much about this aspect of human variation. In the “thought experiment” I presented I indicated that focus on the largest signals of between population variation alone can miss a great deal.
