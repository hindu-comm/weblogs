Tick-tock biological clock

There will be an interesting presentation tomorrow at the [European Society of Human Reproduction & Embryology](http://www.eshre.eu/01/default.aspx?pageid=3). Basically the researcher is going to present on a method for predicting when a woman will hit menopause. This part from the press release is the important bit:

> **“The results from our study could enable us to make a more realistic > assessment of women’s reproductive status many years before they reach > menopause.** For example, if a 20-year-old woman has a concentration > of serum AMH of 2.8 ng/ml \[nanograms per millilitre\], we estimate > that she will become menopausal between 35-38 years old. To the best > of our knowledge this is the first prediction of age at menopause that > has resulted from a population-based cohort study. We believe that our > estimates of ages at menopause based on AMH levels are of sufficient > validity to guide medical practitioners in their day-to-day practice, > so that they can help women with their family planning.”

The method:

> By taking blood samples from 266 women, aged 20-49, who had been > enrolled in the much larger Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, Dr > Ramezani Tehrani and her colleagues were able to measure the > concentrations of a hormone that is produced by cells in women’s > ovaries – anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH). AMH controls the development > of follicles in the ovaries, from which oocytes (eggs) develop and it > has been suggested that AMH could be used for measuring ovarian > function. The researchers took two further blood samples at three > yearly intervals, and they also collected information on the women’s > socioeconomic background and reproductive history. In addition, the > women had physical examinations every three years. The Tehran Lipid > and Glucose Study is a prospective study that started in 1998 and is > still continuing.

The standard objection to sample size will naturally be brought forth, but if it’s a valid diagnostic I assume it’ll get popular really quickly.

Here are the results:

> Dr Ramezani Tehrani was able to use the statistical model to identify > AMH levels at different ages that would predict if women were likely > to have an early menopause (before the age of 45). She found that, for > instance, AMH levels of 4.1 ng/ml or less predicted early menopause in > 20-year-olds, AMH levels of 3.3 ng/ml predicted it in 25-year-olds, > and AMH levels of 2.4 ng/ml predicted it in 30-year-olds. >
> In contrast, AMH levels of at least 4.5 ng/ml at the age of 20, 3.8 > ngl/ml at 25 and 2.9 ng/ml at 30 all predicted an age at menopause of > over 50 years old. The researchers found that the average age at > menopause for the women in their study was approximately 52.

Remember this is a presentation at a conference, not a paper. I don’t have much to say about this from a technical perspective. What do I know? But surely this is important from a science-you-can-use perspective.
