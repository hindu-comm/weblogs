Angus Maddison, 1926-2010

[OECD’s Gurría mourns death of economist Angus Maddison](http://www.oecd.org/document/63/0,3343,en_2649_201185_45068927_1_1_1_1,00.html?rssChId=201185). I highly recommend his books such as [Contours of the World Economy 1-2030 AD](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199227209/geneexpressio-20/). I would concede that the data would sometimes be sketchy or fragmentary, but when it comes to historical models there’s a lot more jabber than legwork. It is notable how much the jabberers have citations to Maddison’s research.
