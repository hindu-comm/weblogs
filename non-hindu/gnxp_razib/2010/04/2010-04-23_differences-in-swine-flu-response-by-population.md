Differences in swine flu response by population

Remember when there was talk about how [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#Outbreak_in_south_China) might disproportionately hit Chinese in comparison to other populations? Here’s a new paper on how Swine Flu may progress in different populations, [Clinical Findings and Demographic Factors Associated With ICU Admission in Utah Due to Novel 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection](http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/137/4/752.full.html):

> The ICU cohort of 47 influenza patients had a median age of 34 years, > Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 21, and BMI > of 35 kg/m². Mortality was 17% (8/47). All eight deaths occurred among > the 64% of patients (n = 30) with ARDS, 26 (87%) of whom also > developed multiorgan failure. Compared with the Salt Lake County > population, patients with novel A(H1N1) were more likely to be obese > (22% vs 74%;*P* \< .001), medically uninsured (14% vs 45%;*P* \< > .001), and Hispanic (13% vs 23%;*P* \< .01) or **Pacific Islander (1% > vs 26%;** ***P*** **\< .001)**. Observed ICU admissions were 15-fold > greater than expected for those with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² (standardized morbidity ratio 15.8, 95% CI, 8.3-23.4) and 1.5-fold greater than expected among those with BMI of 30 to 39 kg/m² for age-adjusted and sex-adjusted rates for Salt Lake County.

Remember that these are 47 intensive care patients, the most extreme cases. Here’s a table with N’s & odds ratios:

I’m struck by the Pacific Islander results. Obviously there are some confounds here, Pacific Islanders are heavier and have lower socioeconomic status from what I know. But the odds ratio is so high. Unfortunately I don’t see the obesity levels of the Pacific Islanders broken out, rather, they controlled for ethnicity by looking only at the white population (and obesity, smoking, etc., still mattered). I wonder how much more susceptible groups from low density or isolated societies, like Pacific Islanders, are to endemic infectious diseases.
