"Counterintuitive" social science finding of the day

Quotes because you might not find it counterintuitive, [Self-Esteem Development From Young Adulthood to Old Age: A Cohort-Sequential Longitudinal Study](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-98-4-645.pdf):

> The authors examined the development of self-esteem from young > adulthood to old age. Data came from the Americans’ Changing Lives > study, which includes 4 assessments across a 16-year period of a > nationally representative sample of 3,617 individuals aged 25 years to > 104 years. **Latent growth curve analyses indicated that self-esteem > follows a quadratic trajectory across the adult life span, increasing > during young and middle adulthood, reaching a peak at about age 60 > years,** and then declining in old age. No cohort differences in the > self-esteem trajectory were found. Women had lower self-esteem than > did men in young adulthood, but their trajectories converged in old > age. Whites and Blacks had similar trajectories in young and middle > adulthood, but the self-esteem of Blacks declined more sharply in old > age than did the self-esteem of Whites. More educated individuals had > higher self-esteem than did less educated individuals, but their trajectories were similar. Moreover, the results suggested that changes in socioeconomic status and physical health account for the decline in self-esteem that occurs in old age

On the other hand, I’m one o those people who also tend to think that “self-esteem” is a bit overrated, so I’m not *that* heartened.
