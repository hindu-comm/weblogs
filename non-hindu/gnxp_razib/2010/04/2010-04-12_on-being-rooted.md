On being rooted

[Rod Dreher](http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/04/the-impermanence-of-things.html) has a [poignant reflection](http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/04/the-impermanence-of-things.html) up on his roots in Louisiana. He finishes:

> I thought about this memory this weekend, visiting Ruthie and my > family. Ruthie and Mike bought part of what was once the orchard from > our distant cousins, and built their house there. The rest of the land > that had once been Lois and Hilda’s was sold to strangers. The cabin > has long been gone; a nice big brick house belonging to someone I > don’t know is now where the cabin was. True to Hilda’s palm-reading > prophecy, I traveled far in my life. I have now spent well over half > my life living away from there. Yet that is home for me, because that > is where my family is, and the landscape of my childhood. Now, though, > my parents are getting up in years, and my younger sister, at age 40, > is battling a disease that may take her life. I hadn’t realized until > this crisis with Ruthie how much I had counted on the continuity of > her remaining there, even after our parents pass away, to anchor that > place as the center of my imaginative universe. She, who has always > loved the land and her place there far more than I, and she, whom I > could count on to always be faithful to it, however unfaithful I was, > sits in her armchair in what was once the orchard, coughing and > straining for breath. We hope and we pray for healing, but now the way > I thought the world would be may not be the way the world is, or will > become. And I am having a hard time coming to terms with that, as both an emotional and a philosophical matter (i.e., trying to understand how to relate to where I come from now that the permanence I assumed would always be there is threatened).

From what I recall Louisiana is a region of the United States where people move least, and are deeply rooted in their locales. In this way I suppose it’s more like Europe and much of the Old World, with the importance of place encapsulated in terms such as [Heimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat). Though I am an American my family is from Bangladesh, and on the rare occasions that I interact with Bangladeshis I will be asked what my *desh* is, roughly my ancestral homeland. That would happen to be a small town in the southeast of modern Bangladesh, where my paternal ancestors settled several centuries ago, and where my extended family still has lands. But here’s the thing: **I’ve never been to “my” *desh*.** My parents always found this amusing when I asked as a child how my homeland could be a place to which I’d never been, and on some level I think they accept that these terms are anachronistic. Like much of Asia Bangladesh has seen massive urbanization within the past generation, and I get the sense that these old terms are far less relevant. In some ways it may be that Europe and North America, where development and modernization occurred at a slower place, may be the regions where a traditional sense of place remains the most robust because of the more gentle transition from the past to the future.
