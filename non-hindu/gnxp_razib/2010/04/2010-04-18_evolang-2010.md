Evolang 2010

Over at [Babel’s Dawn](http://www.babelsdawn.com/), Edmund Blair Bolles has [written](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/evolang-2010-opens.html) [several](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/language-and-its-core-properties.html) [blog](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/neanderthal_data_grows.html) [posts](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/neural-replicators-1.html) about the recent [Evolang 2010](http://www.let.uu.nl/evolang2010.nl) conference. They’re all worth reading, just to get a gist of the varying approaches taken to language evolution, with Bolles singling out talks by [Morten Christiansen](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/no-language-universals-in-this-theory.html) and [Terrence Deacon](http://www.babelsdawn.com/babels_dawn/2010/04/grand-cru-dutrecht-1.html) as being particular highlights. Not too surprisingly, Deacon is discussing his latest idea (which I mentioned [here](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/linguistics/the-evolution-of-symbolic-language)) about relaxed selection. In Bolles’ own words:

> The strength of Deacon’s presentation was that it described a > mechanism for the brain changes that support language. The old view > that language functions are confined to a few regions like Broca’s > area and Wernicke’s area, or even the left hemisphere can no longer > stand. Language processing involves complex coordination between multiple systems. But the modern human brain is a relatively recent acquisition. How did all that complexity evolve and become coordinated? >
> Deacon proposes a three-phase scenario: >
> 1.  Standard primate brain in which midbrain areas (older parts of the >     brain) control vocal emotional communications. > 2.  A duplication of a section of the genome leads to “relaxed >     selection” and extensive cross talk between many cerebral cortical systems (newer parts of the brain). 3.  “Unmasked selection” fixes new functional coordination and drives the brain’s anatomical reorganization.
