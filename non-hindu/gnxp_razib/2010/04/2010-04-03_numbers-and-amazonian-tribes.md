Numbers and Amazonian Tribes

The Guardian has [a great extract](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/31/alex-bellos-numberland) from [Alex Bellos](http://alexbellos.com/)‘ new book [*Alex’s Adventures in Numberland*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alexs-Adventures-Numberland-Alex-Bellos/dp/0747597162). Besides sounding like the title to a mathematician’s experimentation with LSD, the book dedicates a section (the abstract in the Guardian) on the work of a linguist, [Pierre Pica](http://www.pierrepica.com/), and his discovery that the [Munduruku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munduruku) tribe only count up to five. Although even this claim is dubious:

> When there was one dot on the screen, the Munduruku said “*pug*“. When > there were two, they said “*xep* *xep*“. But beyond two, they were not > precise. When three dots showed up, “*ebapug*” was said only about 80% > of the time. The reaction to four dots was “*ebadipdip*” in only 70% > of cases. When shown five dots, “*pug* *pogbi*” was managed only 28% > per cent of the time, with “*ebadipdip*” given instead in 15% of > answers. In other words, for three and above the Munduruku’s number > words were really just estimates. They were counting “one”, “two”, > “three-ish”, “four-ish”, “five-ish”. Pica started to wonder whether “*pug* *pogbi*“, which literally means “handful”, even really qualified as a number. Maybe they could not count up to five, but only to four-ish?

The whole article reminded me of another Amazonian tribe, [the Pirahã](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_people), and how they don’t even have a numerical system. In fact, many of the Amazonian tribes and languages are throwing up some interesting findings, like a restricted numerical system and the absence of both quantifiers and grammatical tense. For those of you interested, I’d recommend reading [Dan Everett’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Everett) book ([Don’t Sleep There Are Snakes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Sleep-There-are-Snakes/dp/1846680301)) on his experiences with the Pirahã.
