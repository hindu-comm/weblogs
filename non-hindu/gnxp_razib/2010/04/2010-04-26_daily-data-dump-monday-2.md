Daily Data Dump (Monday)

[How do non-genic polymorphisms influence disease risk?](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/uncategorized/how-do-non-genic-polymorphisms-influence-disease-risk) It might be gene expression and regulation.

[Law tackles U.K. caste discrimination](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/04/22/pm-uk-caste-discrimination/). Britain’s doing a great job assimilating at brown people with their ‘authentic’ barbaric traditions, isn’t it? (of all religions) *Viva la multibarbarism!*

[Why Belief in God Is Not Innate](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304222504575173890997846742.html?mod=WSJ_article_related). I think the author is trying too hard, playing shell games with various types of non-*Christianity*. Unfortunately this area is dominated by pro and anti religious polemicists who wish to promote a strong and exclusive form of their prediction.

[Complexity and Diversity](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5977/494). Frequency dependence is critical in maintaining variation on the intra and inter species level. Economists aren’t the only ones who need to move beyond equilibrium thinking.

[Liars’ Brains Wired Differently](http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/11655.html). I think many of you will click this, so I’ll let the title speak for itself.
