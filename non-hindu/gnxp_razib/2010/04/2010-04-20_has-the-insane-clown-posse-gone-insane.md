Has the Insane Clown Posse gone insane?

I’ve heard some buzz about some weird new video that the Insane Clown Posse came out with, but after watching this strange parody on SNL I had to check out the original. So first the parody:

You can see the original video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs). It’s actually pretty strange in and of itself. Here’s [a more typical video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMUknpEJdl4) from the group. Their stuff normally reminds me of the movie [Gummo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummo). I assume they’re mellowing since they’re pushing beyond their mid-30s and both have replicated (“Shaggy 2 Dope” up to replacement).

**Note:** The videos are NSFW if you have the volume on. But really, if you’re at work you should have headphones on.
