Daily Data Dump

[Dave Weigel](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/) is up & running at *The Washington Post*, covering conservative politics.

[Archaeologists Uncover Land Before Wheel; Site Untouched for 6,000 Years](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100406133712.htm). Of course the New World civilizations \~1492 were also pre-wheel.

[Realty Check: ‘Extreme Makeover’ Downsizes Its Dream Homes](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304017404575165840903285032.html?mod=WSJ_hp_editorsPicks). Mo money = mo problems (remember, home equal = \$).

[The Science of Kissing COVER!](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/06/the-science-of-kissing-cover/) Sheril has a cover. Nice.

[Today’s Social Liberal Is Tomorrow’s Social Conservative](http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/todays-social-liberal-tomorrows-social-conservative). Looking at the GSS I’ve found that conservatives of all ages tend to agree when it comes to issues like homosexuality, while liberals exhibit a split between old & young. Don’t know whether this is transitory, or a general feature of social change in the United States.
