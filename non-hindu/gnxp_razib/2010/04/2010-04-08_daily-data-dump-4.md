Daily Data Dump

[“Positive” Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010068). Physics is more objective than psychology. Too bad they didn’t include even softer disciplines like history or literature, though I don’t know how they’d do that since the methodologies start to get weird.

[The first metazoa living in permanently anoxic conditions](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/30). Wow, even complex organisms don’t need oxygen necessarily.

[Small Cancer Protection From Fruits And Vegetables?](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/007080.html) There really needs to be a reformation of the publishing of correlations coming out of nutritional studies, as people are way too apt to act on provisional findings.

[Why Do We Dream?](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2010/04/why-do-we-dream.html) Trippy.

[Why Investors Won’t Revolt](http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/money-trail/2010/04/06/why-investors-wont-revolt). Shareholders demand risk. More risk = more reward (and more downside). Most people can’t give you [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(investment)) so they’ll swap in [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) and pretend.
