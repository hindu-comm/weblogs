Credibility of the Wikio science blogs rankings

[Greg Laden](http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/04/wikio_science_blogs_rankings.php) posted the Wikio science blogs rankings for this month. Here they are:

First, where’s [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/)? Like him or hate him P. Z. Myers has to be high on this list. Where’s [Cosmic Variance](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/)? [Not Exactly Rocket Science](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience)? Perhaps some of these weblogs opted out of the rankings, I don’t know. But whatever is going on, something doesn’t pass the smell test here. For what it’s worth, my own weblog is ranked highly, but at the old URL, so I assume I’ll slowly start journeying south on the rankings as people start switching links.
