Shadows of menageries past

Following the destruction of its only known rainforest habitat, scientists had no idea whether the species still existed in the wild — or even whether it was a distinct species….

Living today is much more awesome than the 19th century overall, **but**, we’ve mapped the whole world, and have a good sense of all the large animals (at least the upper bound, unfortunately the number seems to be dropping). Call me mammal-centric, but I feel that we have tapped out most of the zoological wonder of our planet. Is it too much to say that the terrestrial domain now involves mostly the counting of beetles? (I exaggerate!) But sometimes there’s a lemur in Madagascar or a rare ungulate in Vietnam, and we get a sense of the wonder which once was (along with all the -isms which we now abhor!). Could you imagine the blog posts that [Carl Zimmer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/) or [Ed Yong](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/) could have written about the discovery of the Platypus? Actually, they’d probably end up narrating a special on the *National Geographic Channel*….

Here’s the original paper: [MtDNA and nDNA corroborate existence of sympatric dwarf lemur species at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WNH-4YJ4NBJ-5&_user=10&_coverDate=03/06/2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=6a5877960f9f35a9f1059b5bcec45b8e).
