The aliens are out to get us!

Several people have pointed me to Stephen Hawking’s [warning about ‘First Contact’ with aliens](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7631252/Stephen-Hawking-alien-life-is-out-there-scientist-warns.html). Specifically that we’d be on the short end of the stick. His worry reminded me of something I read as a child which shocked me somewhat when I encountered it, as I was conditioned by a post-[Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345331354/geneexpressio-20) optimism. Here’s the author:

That was Jared Diamond in [The Third Chimpanzee](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060845503/geneexpressio-20). In terms of this particular concern I have to admit that my attitude is encapsulated by Arthur C. Clarke’s [third law of prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws). An advanced alien race is basically going to have magical powers in relation to humanity, and I doubt anything we do will matter either way (i.e., I don’t think we could hide, or, get their attention). But my main question is why haven’t the [von Neumann machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine) already co-opted all the matter and energy in the universe? The [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) is a real issue. There are still big questions that we have no idea or clue about.
