Daily Data Dump (Friday)

[What is the impact of strict population control?](http://dailymonthly.com/?p=306) Unintended consequences. Note the convergence in fertility between South Korea and the People’s Republic of China. Coercion or no, some things are inevitable.

[Beating Obesity](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/03/beating-obesity/8017/). Marc Ambinder went from 235 to 150 in a year after surgery.
