Daily Data Dump (Tuesday)

[Angst on the Aegean](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com//features/2010/1003.clark.html). Like many Third World countries Greece is characterized by familialism and rampant corruption typical of a low trust society (more on the [familialism](http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/04/is-the-greek-family-wrecking-greeces-economy.html)). Except thanks to geography Hellenes are like a boat being lifted by the rising tide of the dynamic economies of other European nations (the reason Mexico has a GDP PPP per capita of \$15,000 and Colombia \$9,000 probably has something to do the former’s more favorable location). Greek culture and government seems trapped in a particularly unfortunate equilibrium, and the buck stops soon. I have mooted that perhaps many nations in this position might benefit from the importation of a [Suomalaiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finns) bureaucratic class to “shock” the society to another state where virtuous circles of trust may arise. Such a mandarin caste would be congenitally incapable of eye contact, minimizing the ability to weasel out bribes.

[Exploring the Complexities of Nerdiness, for Laughs](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27bang.html?hpw). I’d probably watch this show if I owned a TV.

[The Search for Genes Leads to Unexpected Places](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27gene.html). Since this is a Carl Zimmer piece of course it’s worth reading. Turns out that there are many interesting insights one can glean from the tree of life which are of general import.

[Lady Bugs to the Rescue in the Galapagos: Biocontrol of Insect Pest Is a Major Success, Entomologists Say](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100422164635.htm). “Non-native species” become useful agents of “biocontrol” in the right context!

[Ethnic Differences in Precursors of Type 2 Diabetes Apparent at an Early Age](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100420174119.htm). It’s hard to be brown. Brown like me, not [Gordon Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown), or [*faux*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Ramos_(news_anchor)) [brown](http://obama.3cdn.net/1af1397cf0da87f431_al0mvy1ke.gif).

[“Save A Mother”: An Appeal](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/accidental_blogger/2010/04/save-a-mother-an-appeal.html). My friend Ruchira Paul is trying to raise money for a charity focused on Indian rural maternal health after she got to know the doctor who heads it. You can find out more [here](http://save-a-mother.org/).
