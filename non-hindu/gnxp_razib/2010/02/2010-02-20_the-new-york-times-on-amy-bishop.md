The New York Times on Amy Bishop

Covers all the [major angles](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/us/21bishop.html?pagewanted=print). Nice that there’s a newspaper which can support this sort of reporting (on [the other hand](http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/sausage/2010/02/20/story-new-york-times-wont-touch)). Not surprising that Amy Bishop seems to have some history of delusions of grandeur, she’s claiming that both she and her husband have an [I.Q. of 180](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/us/20alabama.html?pagewanted=print). That’s 5.3 standard deviations above the mean. Assuming a normal distribution that’s a 1 in 20 million probability. Of course the tails of the distribution are fatter beyond 2 standard deviations than expectation for I.Q., but at these really high levels (above 160) I’m skeptical that most tests are measuring anything real.
