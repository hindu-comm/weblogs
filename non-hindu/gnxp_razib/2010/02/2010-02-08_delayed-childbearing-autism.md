Delayed childbearing & autism

[Independent and dependent contributions of advanced maternal and paternal ages to autism risk](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123275763/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

> Reports on autism and parental age have yielded conflicting results on > whether mothers, fathers, or both, contribute to increased risk. We > analyzed restricted strata of parental age in a 10-year California > birth cohort to determine the independent or dependent effect from > each parent. Autism cases from California Department of Developmental > Services records were linked to State birth files (1990-1999). Only > singleton births with complete data on parental age and education were > included (n=4,947,935, cases=12,159). In multivariate logistic > regression models, advancing maternal age increased risk for autism > monotonically regardless of the paternal age. Compared with mothers > 25-29 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for mothers 40+ > years was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.35-1.70), or compared with mothers \<25 > years of age, aOR=1.77 (95% CI, 1.56-2.00). In contrast, autism risk > was associated with advancing paternal age primarily among mothers > \<30: aOR=1.59 (95% CI, 1.37-1.85) comparing fathers 40+ vs. 25-29 > years of age. However, among mothers \>30, the aOR was 1.13 (95% CI, > 1.01-1.27) for fathers 40+ vs. 25-29 years of age, almost identical to > the aOR for fathers \<25 years. Based on the first examination of > heterogeneity in parental age effects, it appears that women’s risk > for delivering a child who develops autism increases throughout their > reproductive years whereas father’s age confers increased risk for > autism when mothers are \<30, but has little effect when mothers are past age 30. **We also calculated that the recent trend towards delayed childbearing contributed approximately a 4.6% increase in autism diagnoses in California over the decade.**
