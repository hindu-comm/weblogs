Why we need to avoid Middle Eastern entanglements: too complicated!

*The New York Times* has an article attempting to clarify complex political tensions cross-linked with religious identity (or not), [In an Iraqi City, the Real Ballot Contest Is for Shiite Leadership](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/world/middleeast/25shiite.html?ref=global-home&pagewanted=print). The author, Anthony Shadid, states:

> The contest bears down on one of the unanswered questions in Iraq’s > tortured narrative of invasion, occupation, war and recovery. **The > country today stands as the only Arab state in which Shiite Muslims rule.** Nasiriya is a stage, rendered small, where several Shiite currents, from street movements to venerable parties, are now vying for ascendancy.

That’s not really true. The Alawites of Syria dominate that Sunni-majority nation arguably with as tight a fist as the Sunni Arabs dominated Baath-era Iraq, or the Sunni royal family of Bahrain dominates that island nation. The [Alawites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Alawi) are Shia, or at least identify as such. They’ve long had a tacit alliance with Iran, and the Iranian regime’s lack of support for the Sunni Islamists of Hama, who were [massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_massacre) by Hafez Assad’s army in 1982, reputedly had a lot to do with Sunni rejection of Iran as a leader for worldwide Islamic revivalism. Throughout the 1980s Baathist Syria was aligned against Baathist Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War, in keeping with Syria’s traditional pro-Iranian tilt (Syria also is a secondary patron of Hezbollah).  
In any case, this is all relatively academic, **except for the fact that Syria borders on Iraq, has millions of Iraqi refugees, and likely served as a base for Iraqi insurgents.** How does the fact that Syria is dominated by a heterdox Shia sect which rules a Sunni majority influence its relationship to Iraq? That’s for you to explore. I just think it is worth pointing out this error, because if *The New York Times* can get basic facts retrievable from Wikipedia wrong how much should you trust it when it comes to the political dynamics of an obscure Iraqi city?\*  
\* Vali Nasr’s [The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393329682/geneexpressio-20/) is worth reading, as he outlines the network of Shia religious movements which span Iran to Lebanon, and now have come into stark relief with the emergence of a “Shia arc” of Iran, Iraq, Syria (Shia dominated) and Lebanon (Hezbollah becoming operational king-makers).
