Defining "synthetic associations" down

David Goldstein and collegues report today [the results of a genome-wide association study](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08825.html) for a particular side effect (treatment-induced [anemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia)) of treatment for hepatitis C. It turns out that variants in a single gene–ITPA–are overwhelmingly associated with the development of this side effect. This is a nice, probably clinically-important result, and there’s likely some interesting biology here as well.

One twist is that the authors identify two presumably causal variants in the gene–one a nonsynonymous SNP, and the other a SNP falling in a splice site. The authors make the following point:

> Two related features of these observations are worth emphasizing. > **First, the ITPA variants constitute a clear example of a synthetic > association** in which the effects of rarer functional variants are > observed as an association for a more common variant present on a > whole-genome genotyping chip: indeed, the minor-allele frequency is > higher for the top-associated SNP rs6051702 (19.4%) than for the > causal variants rs1127354 (7.6%) and rs7270101 (12.3%) in > European-Americans

Some readers will recall the paper recently published by this group on “[synthetic associations](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000294)“, where they posited a model for common diseases in which multiple rare (\< 5% minor allele frequency) SNPs in a gene can lead to identification of as association with a common allele. Now, it appears, any gene with more than one functional variant, rare or not, fits their model!

That aside, I can see their point–the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around a locus with two causal variants leads in this case to a strong association signal at a SNP that happens to be correlated with both of them. But this isn’t a new phenomenon worthy of a special name; for example, multiple correlated SNPs in the MHC [influence risk for celiac disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2274985/), and most people are happy to call it that–multiple causal variants at a locus. It seems a bit like the authors are trying to shoehorn the data to fit their theories a bit awkwardly.
