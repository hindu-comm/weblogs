Homo erectus and EDAR?

In [Why Evolution is True](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/), [Jerry Coyne](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/) has the following parenthetical aside about population variation in morphology in *H. erectus*:

> (*H. erectus* from Chinaâ€¦had shovel-shaped incisor teeth not found in other populations)

This stopped me dead in my tracks: modern East Asian populations have similar tooth morphology, [caused in part by a positively-selected nonsynonymous change in the gene EDAR](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2809%2900402-9). Could this be an example of convergent evolution of tooth morphology in hominins?

However, a cursory google suggests that shovel-shaped incisors might be thought to be a trait general to *H. erectus*, not specific to Asian populations. Can anyone clarify this?
