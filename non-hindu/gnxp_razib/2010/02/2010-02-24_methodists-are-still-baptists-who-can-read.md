Methodists are still Baptists who can read

[Income by Religions](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2010/02/income-by-religions.html):

Methodist.**

On a national level, there are. Pew’s [Religious Landscape Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/) has detailed tables on educations, income, etc., broken down by denomination. Here’s a table I created (I left out historically black denominations). The values are percentages in each category, though the last column is a ratio:

I ordered by % with more than \$100,000 per year income, except for the total American population, which is at the bottom. The relationship between education and income is pretty strong on a denominational level:

I was curious if there was a relationship between liberalism and being relatively poor in relation to educational attainment. The United Church of Christ stands out here. So here’s a plot:  
[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/episcorich2.png?resize=640%2C469 "episcorich2")![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/episcorich2.png?resize=640%2C469 "episcorich2")](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/episcorich2.png)

This probably needs to be looked at in more detail, this was just a “quick & dirty.” Though it is striking to me how the 19th century truism of a social rank order of Episcopal \> Presbyterian \> Methodist \> Baptists, seems to obtain in the early 21st century. Sensitivity to initial conditions.
