PIIGS are mostly ethical, if bad with money

By now, you probably know that there is a specter haunting Europe, and that specter is [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Argentina#The_Argentine_crisis). [Greece’s debt crisis](http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Greece-Debt-Crisis-EU-Leaders-Attend-Summit-On-Possible-Bailout-And-Implications-For-The-Continent/Article/201002215546539?lpos=World_News_Top_Stories_Header_0&lid=ARTICLE_15546539_Greece_Debt_Crisis:_EU_Leaders_Attend_Summit_On_Possible_Bailout_And_Implications_For_The_Continent) is putting the spotlight on the PIIGS nations of the Eurozone, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.  
One thing to note is that besides mismanaging their fiscal situation, 4 of he 5 PIIGS are more ethical than the Swedes. Sweden’s total fertility rate per woman is \~1.67.  
Ireland = 1.85  
Greece = 1.51  
Spain = 1.39  
Italy = 1.41  
Portugal = 1.49  
Ireland is the bad seed here, being profligate **and** unethical. The downside to being ethical is that it makes the welfare state geared toward old age benefits a bit less plausibly sustainable. A simple matter of [unfavorable dependency ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_ratio). I suppose the Greeks could invite in huge numbers of semi-literate Anatolian peasants to take care of their aged, but I’m not sure that either set is going to be too excited by such a prospect. I for one hope that the Greeks et al. are ready to welcome their robot overlords! It’s either the tin-man or the Turk.  
**Addendum:** Or perhaps [Sandmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan's_run) or [soylent green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_green#Plot)?
