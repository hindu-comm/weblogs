Why What Darwin Got Wrong is wrong

[Misunderstanding Darwin: Natural selection’s secular critics get it wrong](http://bostonreview.net/BR35.2/block_kitcher.php):

> Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini take the role of philosophy to consist > in part in minding other people’s business. We agree with the spirit > behind this self-conception. Philosophy can sometimes help other areas > of inquiry. Yet those who wish to help their neighbors are well > advised to spend a little time discovering just what it is that those > neighbors do, and those who wish to illuminate should be sensitive to > charges that they are kicking up dust and spreading confusion.*What > Darwin Got Wrong* shows no detailed engagement with the practice of > evolutionary biology, nor does it respond to the many criticisms that > have been leveled against earlier versions of its central ide**as. In > this latter respect, the authors resemble the creationist debaters** > who assert that evolution is incompatible with the second law of > thermodynamics, hear detailed refutations of their charge, and repeat > their patter in the next forum.

The essay is enjoyable, but as I was reading it I did start to think that one of the resemblances between [What Darwin Got Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374288798/geneexpressio-20/) and standard Intelligent Design works is that they serve to tie up scholars in refuting their arguments.
