Why We Cooperate

PLoS Biology [reviews](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000277?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosbiology/NewArticles+(PLoS+Biology:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Reader) [Why We Cooperate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262013592/geneexpressio-20/):

> What makes us human, what sets us apart from other animal species, and > which traits do we share with our closest living relatives? Ever since > Darwin introduced the notion of continuity in his theory of evolution, > humans have been obsessed with the question of how to distinguish > themselves from all other species. In the postwar period, our species > became known as “Man the Toolmaker,” until in the 1960s Jane Goodall > watched chimpanzees using sticks to fish for termites, and that was > that. We then distinguished ourselves using the term “Man the Hunter,” > but the discovery that chimpanzees and other social carnivores engage > in coordinated hunts refuted this type of collective action as the one > decisive feature. More recently, the issue of culture has entered > center stage. Trying to distinguish the cultural “haves” from the > “have-nots” tends to generate more heat than light, and it seems much > more productive to think about the cognitive prerequisites for social > learning, attribution of mental states, and symbolic communication.
