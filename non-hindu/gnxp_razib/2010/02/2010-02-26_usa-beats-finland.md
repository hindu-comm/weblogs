USA beats Finland

[US routs Finland 6-1, will play for hockey gold](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/26/AR2010022605283.html). It’s really not even fair; this is a nation which was oppressed by *Swedes* for nearly a thousand years. I really hope those losers beat Slovakia so we can face them for the gold. Most of the time we don’t have to think about them, except in the areas of humor and hockey.
