Gene Expression Survey

That time of the year. Please take the [Gene Expression Survey](http://www.AdvancedSurvey.com/default.asp?SurveyID=70954). I’ll put up the analysis and the csv file next week. I have the usual questions, but also added a few more that might seem a bit weird. There are 30 questions total, and you don’t need to answer all of them, but as I said the more you answer the more data there’ll be. I did a trial run and it took less than 5 minutes; most people can answer a question about their sex or religious identity pretty quickly.  
**Update:** You can view the [results of the survey here](http://www.advancedsurvey.com/results/public_results.asp?SurveyID=70954).
