Inbred dogs & GWA

Could be the title of the paper. Anyway, [Genome-wide association mapping identifies multiple loci for a canine SLE-related disease complex](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.525.html):

> …Incidences of specific diseases are elevated in different breeds, > indicating that a few genetic risk factors might have accumulated > through drift or selective breeding. In this study, a GWA study with > 81 affected dogs (cases) and 57 controls from the Nova Scotia duck > tolling retriever breed identified five loci associated with a canine > systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related disease complex that > includes both antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive immune-mediated > rheumatic disease (IMRD) and steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis > (SRMA). Fine mapping with twice as many dogs validated these loci. > **Our results indicate that the homogeneity of strong genetic risk > factors within dog breeds allows multigenic disorders to be mapped > with fewer than 100 cases and 100 controls, making dogs an excellent > model in which to identify pathways involved in human complex > diseases.**

In which case, skip the dogs. There are plenty of human populations where family reunions, not college, is where you find your “life partner”:

They’re running out of oil and water in Yemen, perhaps their unique local inbred clans could be of service to medical genetics, though I don’t know the bioethics of paying for these studies. I do recall genetic homogeneity of Icelanders was one of the selling points of why [deCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCODE_genetics) was going to be a big success….
