Saint relic might not be real, who would have thought….

[Analysis of the Putative Remains of a European Patron Saint-St. Birgitta](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008986):

> Saint Birgitta (Saint Bridget of Sweden) lived between 1303 and 1373 > and was designated one of Europe’s six patron saints by the Pope in > 1999. According to legend, the skulls of St. Birgitta and her daughter > Katarina are maintained in a relic shrine in Vadstena abbey, mid > Sweden. The origin of the two skulls was assessed first by analysis of > mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to confirm a maternal relationship. The > results of this analysis displayed several differences between the two > individuals, thus supporting an interpretation of the two skulls not > being individuals that are maternally related. Because the efficiency > of PCR amplification and quantity of DNA suggested a different amount > of degradation and possibly a very different age for each of the > skulls, an orthogonal procedure, radiocarbon dating, was performed. > The radiocarbon dating results suggest an age difference of at least > 200 years and neither of the dating results coincides with the period > St. Birgitta or her daughter Katarina lived. The relic, thought to > originate from St. Birgitta, has an age corresponding to the 13th > century (1215-1270 cal AD, 2σ confidence), which is older than > expected. **Thus, the two different analyses are consistent in > questioning the authenticity of either of the human skulls maintained > in the Vadstena relic shrine being that of St. Birgitta.** Of course > there are limitations when interpreting the data of any ancient > biological materials and these must be considered for a final decision > on the authenticity of the remains.

Of course, people are still [debating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin#Analysis_of_the_Shroud) about the Shroud of Turin.
