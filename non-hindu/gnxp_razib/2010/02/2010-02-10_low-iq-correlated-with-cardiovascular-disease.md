Low IQ correlated with cardiovascular disease?

[Second Only to Cigarette Smoking in Large Population Study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/02/100209200754.htm):

> While lower intelligence scores — as reflected by low results on > written or oral tests of IQ — have been associated with a raised risk > of cardiovascular disease, no study has so far compared the relative > strength of this association with other established risk factors such > as obesity, smoking and high blood pressure. Now, a large study funded > by Britain’s Medical Research Council, which set out to gauge the > relative importance of IQ alongside other risk factors, **has found > that lower intelligence scores were associated with higher rates of > cardiovascular disease and total mortality at a greater level of > magnitude than found with any other risk factor except smoking.** >
> … >
> The relative strengths of the association were measured by an “index > of inequality,” which summarised the relative risk of a health outcome > (cardiovascular death) in the most disadvantaged (high risk) people > relative to the most advantaged (low risk). This relative index of > inequality for the top five risk factors was found to be 5.58 for > cigarette smoking, 3.76 for IQ, 3.20 for low income, 2.61 for high > systolic blood pressure, and 2.06 for low physical activity. >
> The investigators note “a number of plausible mechanisms” whereby > lower IQ scores could elevate cardiovascular disease risk, notably the > application of intelligence to healthy behaviour (such as smoking or > exercise) and its correlates (obesity, blood pressure). **A further > possibility, they add, “is that IQ denotes ‘a record’ of environmental > insults” (eg, illness, sub-optimal nutrition) accumulated throughout > life.**
