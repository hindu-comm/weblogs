Amy Bishop, the Stephen Glass of biology?

[Ruchira Paul](http://accidentalblogger.typepad.com/) points me to a blogger [who’s been digging through](https://afamilyofshepherds.blogspot.com/2010/02/is-accused-murderer-dr-amy-bishop.html) Bishop’s recent published works, and there’s a lot of fishy stuff in there. You have to read it to believe it. [Here’s the conclusion](https://afamilyofshepherds.blogspot.com/2010/02/is-accused-murderer-dr-amy-bishop.html):

> There is no question that Dr. Bishop is smart. But it also seems very > evident that she suffers delusions of genuis. Far from establishing a record of accomplishment warranting the grant of tenure, since joining UAH Dr. Bishop took a long nap on her one true laurel — her affiliation with Harvard .  
> Evidence strongly suggests that Dr. Bishop used her husband, her > family and by all appearances the sham ‘Cherokee Labsystems’ to fabricate a record of recent accomplishments. Her use of essentially an online vanity publisher further diminishes her professional stature.  
> It should have been no surprise to Dr. Bishop that the University easily saw through the smoke and mirrors and that she would not receive tenure. But an oversized ego can be blinding.  
> It seems clear that Dr. Bishop re-wrote the rules for herself. Rather > than face the reality that she needed to conduct real research and > publish substantial, scholarly work in peer reviewed journals, Dr. Bishop tried to cheat her way to tenure. And, when that failed, it appears Dr. Bishop premeditated a new plan: if you don’t accept what I publish, you will perish.

Some readers mentioned putting her kids on a paper as a co-author. But it might not have been an isolated incident.
