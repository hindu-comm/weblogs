Genome-Wide Associations in Asians

[Genome-Wide Association Study in Asian Populations Identifies Variants in ETS1 and WDFY4 Associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000841?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+plosgenetics/NewArticles+(PLoS+Genetics:+New+Articles)&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher):

WDFY4 is a huge > protein with unknown function but is predominantly expressed in > primary and secondary immune tissues, and a nonsynonymous SNP in this gene was found to be highly associated with SLE susceptibility. Our findings shed new light on the function of these genes as well as the mechanism of this devastating disease.

This sort of stuff is necessary because you can’t always extrapolate associations found in studies where the subjects were of population X to population Y. Even this minimal level of population genetic variance might cause issues:

> An interesting analysis result from our GWAS data is the difference > between Hong Kong samples and samples collected in Taiwan and Beijing, > shown by principal component analysis…It suggests population > substructure for Chinese living in different regions, which may cause > spurious findings in association studies when cases and controls are > not well matched. With most of the genetic variants of relatively > larger effect sizes already being identified, GWAS becomes more > susceptible to effects from mismatches between cases and controls in dealing with SNPs of smaller effect sizes. Our analysis echoed two very recent reports delineating population substructures in Chinese populations living in different geographical regions

Imagine that the NIH funded genome-wide association studies where the subjects were Americans of Chinese descent. Because of the nature of American Chinese communities the population would be strongly skewed toward Cantonese and Fujianese. In China itself Cantonese and Fujianese are only a small minority, so that might limit the utility of the inferences in terms of their generalizability. Of course, if you had diverse regional and dialect groups thrown into a big pool then you might get spurious associations, which is the worry mooted above.
