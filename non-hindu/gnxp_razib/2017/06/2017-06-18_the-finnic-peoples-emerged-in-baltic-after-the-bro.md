The Finnic peoples emerged in Baltic after the Bronze Age

A reader in [the comments](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/06/17/the-origin-of-the-finnic-peoples/comment-page-1/#comment-2487) reminds me there has been a preprint which is relevant to the population structure of Baltic Europe which came out a few months ago, [Extensive farming in Estonia started through a sex-biased migration from the Steppe](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/02/112714):

> …Here we present the analyses of low coverage whole genome sequence > data from five hunter-gatherers and five farmers of Estonia dated to > 4,500 to 6,300 years before present.

As you can see in the PCA plot above the Comb Ceramic Culture and the Corded Ware culture in Estonia are modeled well by the [three ancestral populations](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7518/full/nature13673.html) hypothesis for Europe. **The problem with this is that Finns and Russians with Finnic background do not fit with this model.** There has been clear later gene flow.

From the text:

Comparing to CCC individuals, modern Estonians lack the > red component \[Eastern Siberian\]. This, **together with the absence > of Y chromosome hg N in CCC and CWC**, points to further influx and > change of genetic material after the arrival of CWC.

The sample sizes are small. **Additionally these are from Estonia, not Finland.** But the Comb Ceramic Culture was widespread throughout the region.

Also, from a 2015 [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714572/#app3) (supplements):

The “North Siberia” cluster are: Selkup, Chukchi, Dolgan, Ket, Koryak, Nganassan, Yakut and Yukagir. The admixture is very recent. I suspect too recent. But it gets us to the qualitative point that the Siberian admixture into Finns is probably not that old.
