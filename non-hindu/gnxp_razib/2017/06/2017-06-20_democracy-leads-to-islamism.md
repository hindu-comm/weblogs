Democracy leads to Islamism

Years ago in graduate school I told a friend that democracy and even economic prosperity did not monotonically lead to greater liberalism. **In the long run perhaps, but in the short run it doesn’t necessarily do that at all.**

In the United States the emergence of **universal white man’s suffrage** during the [Age of Jackson](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316773433/geneexpressio-20) signaled the rise of a much more muscular and exclusive white supremacy in this country. In [Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674031962/geneexpressio-20) you see the arc of democratization tethering itself to conservative rural vote-banks which reinforce aristocratic privilege. Finally, democratic developments in Burma have seen an associated increase in [Buddhist radicalism](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/2/myanmars-buddhist-terrorism-problem.html).

The 1979 revolution in Iran and its aftermath has been argued to be a victory of the bazar over the Western oriented gentry. In India the rise of Hindu nationalism is an assertion of the self-confidence of sub-elites from the “cow belt” who arose to challenge the Western oriented ruling class that had dominated since the early 20th century.

When the Arab Spring was in full swing in 2011 I wrote [An Illiberal People](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2011/12/03/an-illiberal-people/):

> In newly democratic nations which are pushed toward universal suffrage > and the full panoply of democratic institutions the organic process of > developing some safeguards for minorities and liberal norms has never > evolved, because there was no evolution. Rather, these democracies are > being created out of a box. Instead of a gradual shift toward more > cultural conservatism with broader franchise, in these contexts it is > a foundational aspect of the democratic system. I suspect this may > have long term repercussions, as in other contexts liberal elites > often institutionalized or established norms which served to check > majoritarian populist impulses as they ceded much of their power over > time.

The modern Left has a very anodyne view of Islam. It denies that there is something structurally within many Islamic societies which enables their illiberalism, the religion of Islam. In [Islamic Exceptionalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0176XHHTA/geneexpressio-20) Shadi Hamid argues that the religion itself may in some fundamental manner be inimical to the sort of secular liberal democratic society we perceive to be the terminal state of all cultures. **I disagree with this view.**Rather, I see in contemporary Islam the torture that Reformation era Christianity experienced attempting to navigate between an ideal of a universal church and the nascent emergence of nation-states. But in the short term both Shadi and I have the same prediction: **greater democracy may lead to greater illiberalism and more repression of minorities**. This an inconvenient truth for many Americans. But it may be true nonetheless.
