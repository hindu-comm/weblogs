What determines the rate of evolution

The tweet above from Wiley relates to a paper, [Polygamy slows down population divergence in shorebirds](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13212/full?hootPostID=c7089ec7e1c3ca937469d0a5b55e0c09). It’s a cool paper. I tweeted it. **But does it relate to the “rate of evolution”?**

Different people will have different answers, as it was evident on Twitter. For me my surprise was due to my definition for what evolution is: **change is allele frequencies over time**. This is far more fundamental than speciation. But then I don’t think much about speciation.

Some people brought up divergence. But divergence for me is not necessary, a population could remain unitary but exhibit large allele frequency changes. Then again, if you study phylogenetics on a macroevolutionary scale, as most people who study phylogenetics do, then you would focus on divergence.
