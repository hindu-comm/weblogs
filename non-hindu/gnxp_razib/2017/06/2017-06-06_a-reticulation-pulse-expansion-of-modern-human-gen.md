[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-14.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-14.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GYPKJ2I/geneexpressio-20)In response to a little bit of fatigue at the constant stream of ancient DNA, John Hawks digs the knife in a bit deeper. There’s more. Since Hawks is co-author with Lee Berger of [Almost Human: The Astonishing Tale of Homo Naledi and the Discovery That Changed Our Human Story](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GYPKJ2I/geneexpressio-20), I’m hoping for something related to *naledi*. But barring that, there is still lots to come down the pipeline ([Alexander Kim](https://twitter.com/amwkim?lang=en) has a Twitter account worth following to keep up on this line of research).

But I thought I’d enter something else into the record about what we’re starting to understand about the origins of modern human genetic variation.

1.  The “Out of Africa” movement is a real thing. That is, \~50,000
    years ago a population seems to have diverged from a broader
    pan-African group, and replaced archaic hominins across Eurasia
    (with some admixture at low levels), and then pushed the boundaries
    of our genus to Oceania and the New World. This does not mean that
    there were not earlier “Out of Africas.” Just that the dominant
    signal of variation is due to the pulse that swept out \~50,000
    years ago. 2.  Within Africa the story is different and more complicated. The
    expansion of anatomically modern humans out of Africa occurred
    relatively rapidly from a small founder population (within an order
    of magnitude of \~1,000 individuals seems correct). The archaeology
    and genetics are in pretty good alignment. **But within Africa it
    looks like the lineages which led to modern humans are much deeper,
    and preserve structure that may be hundreds of thousands of years
    old**. Just as we see admixture events giving rise to new lineages
    outside of Africa over the last 50,000 years, the same dynamic
    probably applied to within Africa far earlier.

One way to think about it is that the old “Africa Eve” model is very useful for the 10,000 year period around 50,000 years ago. And, it applies to non-Africans.

The story within Africa though may be more like the old multi-regionalist model, though with stronger biases of gene flow between populations, so that at one time one lineage may be preponderant. Over the last 10,000 years the expansion of certain populations within Africa though (in particular Bantus) has collapsed a lot of the deep structure, and now Africa resembles Eurasia much more (with some Eurasian back-migration too).

**Note:** I am talking about “modern human genetic variation” because I am starting to think talking about “modern humans” obscures far more than it illuminates.
