> The act was carried out “despite the presence of five members of the > zoological staff living on site and surveillance cameras,” the zoo > said. “The entire staff is extremely shocked.” >

> Tuesday’s gruesome event follows an attack on rhinos at an orphanage > in South Africa, home to 70 percent of the remaining 21,000 white > rhinos. Armed poachers broke into the Findimvelo Thula Thula Rhino > Orphanage on February 22 and removed the horns of two 18-month-old > rhinos, Impu and Gugu, after tying up staff members. One rhino was > killed, and the other was later euthanized.
