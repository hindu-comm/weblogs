Beyond cholula, sriracha, and tabasco

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-6.jpeg?resize=225%2C225)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/download-6.jpeg?resize=225%2C225)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D6MU0HM/geneexpressio-20)In the United States it seems that the restaurant table top hot sauces are dominated by an oligopoly. [Cholula](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00PACY7B6/geneexpressio-20), [tabasco](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CAT7TGM/geneexpressio-20), and [sriracha](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0014CSG5Y/geneexpressio-20?th=1) are ubiquitous. And there’s a reason for this: **they are delicious.** All of them have their own unique flavor profiles, as you no doubt know. But there is a whole world of hot sauce and spice beyond these three canonical flavorings.

Recently the Trinidad scorpion pepper [Rapture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D6MU0HM/geneexpressio-20) was recommended to me by a friend, and I brought it in the office. **Almost immediately it became “the” office hot sauce.** It’s complex and delicious flavor, and the high spice content fueled by more than 15 peppers per bottle, have fueled an enthusiasm for hot sauces among my co-workers.

The moral of the story is that readers should explore the a bit more of the world of hot sauce taste than they do right now. Don’t limit yourself to the Pepsi, Coke, and Dr. Pepper of hot sauces.
