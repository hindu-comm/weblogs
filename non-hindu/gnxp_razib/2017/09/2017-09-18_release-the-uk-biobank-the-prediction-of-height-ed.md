Release the UK Biobank! (the prediction of height edition)

It’s like getting the palantír or something.

Anyway, a preprint, submitted for your approval. A vision of things to come?[Accurate Genomic Prediction Of Human Height](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/18/190124):

> We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex > human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational > attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., > machine learning). Replication tests show that these predictors > capture, respectively, \~40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for > the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate \~0.65 with > actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation > samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured > for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA > (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., > as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured > most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve > the common SNP portion of the “missing heritability” problem – i.e., > the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The \~20k > activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture > of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the > UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with > multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in > earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.

A scatter-plot is worth a thousand derivations.

You know what better than 500,000 samples? One billion samples! A nerd can dream….
