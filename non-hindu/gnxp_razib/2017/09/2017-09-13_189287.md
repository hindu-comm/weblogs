America’s age of animated emojis

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/zero_to_one.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/zero_to_one.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00J6YBOFQ/geneexpressio-20)A few days ago I watched the unveiling of Apple’s new [iPhone](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XTKMWV9/geneexpressio-20)(s). Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed…and I probably will stick with a [Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06Y16RL4W/geneexpressio-20). Of course, I know that the [original iPhone](https://techcrunch.com/2007/06/07/the-futurist-we-predict-the-iphone-will-bomb/) was panned, **and it created a whole sector and a lifestyle.** We’re a bit jaded.

But this focus on lifestyle in the technology sector made me reflect on Peter Thiel’s techno-pessimism in the late 2000s, which prompted him to write [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00J6YBOFQ/geneexpressio-20). I’m glad that the best and brightest are going to Silicon Valley in the 2010s, and not Wall Street as in the 2000s. They don’t do positive harm in my opinion, while they did in the 2000s by increasing risk and volatility. But Apple and Facebook seem to be about consumption rather than production. They don’t make us more efficient, effective, they don’t change our civilization in its bones.

There are worse places to be, but then I read that [China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-10/china-s-fossil-fuel-deadline-shifts-focus-to-electric-car-race-j7fktx9z) is setting targets and goals in relation to moving from fossil fuels to electric cars. The Chinese make a lot of goals, and execution is often an issue. **But they have aspirations.** Do we?

Until then, animated emojis….
