Selection for pigmentation in Khoisan?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/skinnaturalhistory.jpeg?resize=189%2C267)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/skinnaturalhistory.jpeg?resize=189%2C267)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BP5KB62/geneexpressio-20)In the recent paper, [Reconstructing Prehistoric African Population Structure](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31008-5), there was a section natural selection. Since my [post](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/09/23/africa-the-churning-continent/) on the paper was already very long I didn’t address this dynamic.

But now I want to highlight this section:

> The functional category that displays the most extreme allele > frequency differentiation between present day San and ancient southern > Africans is ‘‘response to radiation’’ (Z = 3.3 compared to the > genome-wide average). To control for the possibility that genes in > this category show an inflated allele frequency differentiation in general, we computed the same statistic for the Mbuti central African rainforest hunter-gatherer group but found no evidence for selection affecting the response to radiation category. >
> … >
> We speculate that the signal for selection in the response to > radiation category in the San could be due to exposure to sunlight > associated with the life of the Khomani and Juj’hoan North people in the Kalahari Basin, which has become a refuge for hunter-gatherer populations in the last millenia due to encroachment by pastoralist and agriculturalist groups.

And yet earlier this summer I saw a [talk which strongly suggested](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/07/09/slc24a5-is-very-important-but-we-dont-know-why/) that there was a selection in modern Bushman populations for the derived variant of *SLC24A5*, presumably introduced through admixture from East African populations with Eurasian admixture.

In comparison to their neighbors the San are quite light-skinned, so it’s a reasonablesupposition that they have been subject to natural selection recently. The Hadza, in contrast, seem to have the same complexion as their Bantu neighbors.
