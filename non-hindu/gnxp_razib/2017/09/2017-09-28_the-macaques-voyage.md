The macaque’s voyage?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/monkeyvoyage.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/monkeyvoyage.jpeg?resize=182%2C277)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H1YPUWQ/geneexpressio-20)[The Monkey’s Voyage](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H1YPUWQ/geneexpressio-20) was one of the more interesting books I’ve read in the past few years. Basically the author shows that the idea that islands like New Zealand are living mengaries of a lost Gondwanaland is false. Due to extinction islands have high turnover rates, and most species in New Zealand descend from relatively recent arrivals.

And how do they arrive? Larger animals like New World monkeys, probably on rafts made of driftwood.

I thought of that book when reading this fascinating [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/japanese-animals-are-still-washing-up-in-america-after-the-2011-tsunami/541347/?utm_source=twb) in *The Atlantic*, [Japanese Animals Are Still Washing Up in America After The 2011 Tsunami](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/japanese-animals-are-still-washing-up-in-america-after-the-2011-tsunami/541347/?utm_source=twb):

Between them, these bits of ocean-hopping junk carried 289 species that are typically found along Japanese coasts—a vast horde of sponges, sea stars, sea anemones, mussels, limpets, barnacles, and fish. >

Advance to 2011, and we have a vast infrastructure. In the last 50 years, we’ve poised, on the edge of the world, this massive amount of material that’s ready to be washed into the ocean.”
