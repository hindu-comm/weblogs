Population structure in Neanderthals leads to genetic homogeneity

> In France you can find Neanderthals’ tools in your garden, everywhere. A small population is indeed hard to believe.<https://t.co/b2I2WbLUsL> >

The above tweet is in response to a [article]('https://www.quantamagazine.org/genetics-spills-secrets-from-neanderthals-lost-history-20170918/%22) which reports on the finding past month in *PNAS*, [Early history of Neanderthals and Denisovans](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/37/9859.full). It’s open access, you should read it. I don’t think I’ve reviewed it because I haven’t dug through the supplements. To be frank this is a paper where you pretty much have to read the supplements because they’re introducing a somewhat different model here than is the norm.

I talked to Alan Rogers at SMBE about this paper. Broadly, **I think there might be something to it, and it’s because of what David says above.** It is simply hard to imagine that Neanderthals could be extremely successful with such low genetic diversity as we see, and spread so thin. Now, the *Quanta Magazine* tries to emphasize that the effective population is **not** the true census population, but I wish it would have explained it more clearly. Basically, the size that is relevant for breeding is obviously not going to the same as a head count. And, because effective populations are highly sensitive to bottlenecks you can get really small numbers even when the extant population at any given time may be large.

The*PNAS*paper makes some novel inferences, and I’ll set that to the side until I read the supplements. But I don’t think it’s crazy that population structure within Neanderthals could be leading to lower total genetic diversity.
