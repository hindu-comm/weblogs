Inbreeding causing issues in Osama bin Laden’s family

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/understanding_terror_network.jpeg?resize=144%2C222)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/understanding_terror_network.jpeg?resize=144%2C222)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B4FJB1O/geneexpressio-20)I didn’t figure I would have to say much about 9/11 really that others could not say (aside from perhaps you should read Marc Sageman’s [Understanding Terror Networks](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B4FJB1O/geneexpressio-20) if you want an ethnography of the Salafi jihadist movement which lead to al-Qaeda). But *The Daily Best* has a [profile](http://www.thedailybeast.com/bin-ladens-son-is-poised-to-unify-terrorists-worldwide) of one of Osama bin Laden’s sons:

Osama bin Laden had two dozen some children (approximately). But it was strange to me to see mention of ***several*** children with developmental disorders. [Inbreeding](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/01/world/saudi-arabia-awakes-to-the-perils-of-inbreeding.html?mcubz=1) is a major burden for Arab Muslim societies. And sure enough, [Osama bin Laden’s first wife was his first cousin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najwa_Ghanhem). She gave birth to around 10 children. Her father was Osama bin Laden’s mother’s brother. With the possibility of several generations of cousin marriage their relatedness may have been closer than normal half-siblings.

**Note**: Osama bin Laden’s father was from Yemen and his mother from Syria. So he was most certainly not inbred.
