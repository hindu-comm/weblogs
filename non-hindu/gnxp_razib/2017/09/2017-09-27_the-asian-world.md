The Asian world

  
[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/asia_the_world.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/asia_the_world.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004WL4BJ4/geneexpressio-20)We live in interesting times. The world system is slowly shifting back to the historical norm. That norm being that most people and economic production would occur in Asia.

The book [When Asia Was the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004WL4BJ4/geneexpressio-20) chronicles period the between after the fall of the Roman Empirea and on the cusp of the European Age of Discovery. It prefigures a world of interconnections which don’t necessarily loop back to the West. It is strange on Facebook seeing my cousins on Bangladesh joining the international economy, but that economy not necessarily having the United States at its center and fulcrum. We are still the biggest player…but we are not necessarily an indispensable player.

A story in *The New York Times* brings this to mind, [IBM Now Has More Employees in India Than in the U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/technology/ibm-india.html):

> Today, the company employs 130,000 people in India — about one-third > of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their > work spans the entire gamut of IBM’s businesses, from managing the > computing needs of global giants like AT&T and Shell to performing > cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta.

A new global class is organically developing along the scaffolds provided by international corporations. This class, dare I say caste, is beginning to supersede the importance of the [Tribes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679412824/geneexpressio-20) which Joel Kotkin wrote about in the early 1990s.

And no matter what Thomas Friedman and Francis Fukuyama tried to tell us, I’m not quite sure that the global cosmopolitan culture will reflect the mores and preoccupations of the Western post-materialist elite. To be entirely frank I’m not totally sure that this is a bad thing, either.

We can look at economic projections all we want. But the protean and unpredictable nature of cultural changes is really where the action is going to happen in the next few decades, as Islamic revivalism begins to fade and burn itself out.
