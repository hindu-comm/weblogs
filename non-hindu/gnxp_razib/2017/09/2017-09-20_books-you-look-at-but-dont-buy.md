Books you look at but don’t buy

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/introquantgenetics.jpeg?resize=177%2C285)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/introquantgenetics.jpeg?resize=177%2C285)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20)A little while ago I was curious about the **books people looked at through my links which they nevertheless did not buy.** More precisely I was looking at a 90 day interval. The top book people clicked but did not buy was [Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20). I know this is an expensive book, **but if you can afford it you should buy and it read it.** The reasoning is that quantitative genetics is no longer an abstruse topic, as I’m seeing economists conflate correlation of traits between relatives and narrow sense heritability. People have opinions on this topic. Loads.

If you talk about regression to the mean, but barely understand how it works, perhaps you should read [Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20).

Here the remaining of the top 15 (in order from most clicked to least):

[The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812971469/geneexpressio-20)  
[The Harlot by the Side of the Road: Forbidden Tales of the Bible](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002PYFW02/geneexpressio-20)  
[Defenders of the Truth: The Sociobiology Debate](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192862154/geneexpressio-20). This is a good book. I’ve read it three times.  
[The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20)  
[George R. R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones 5-Book Boxed Set](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20)  
[Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20). Really readers? This is why more of you are not HWE aware….  
[Adaptation and Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0030I1XN2/geneexpressio-20)  
[The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20)

[Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684733/geneexpressio-20)

Also, I can go back to 2014. Looking over 90 days from 2014, 2015 and 2016, here are the top 15:

[Why Sex Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00NDDDI4G/geneexpressio-20) has always been a book that gets a lot of clicks. I think it is the title. But it’s rather old now, and on an old fashionedtopic: sex differences. Totally milquetoast in the 2000s, but probably very problematic today….
