It’s a quick read, and a pretty good concise survey of the religion and its history. Recommended.

Next up I think I’ll tackle Martin Meredith’s [The Fortunes of Africa](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JZBA9M4/geneexpressio-20).

[Genomic evidence for population specific selection in Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo linguistic groups in Africa](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/10/186700). The title gets at the interesting parts (though unsurprising). Not sure about the phylogenomic/population history aspect…for example, contends that Sub-Saharan ancestry mostly derives from Nuba mountains. I don’t think that’s true.

Perhaps what I prime has a big impact?

[Why I am not blogging anymore](https://chrisblattman.com/2017/09/06/not-blogging-anymore/). I am one of a dying breed.

In relation to why Twitter is getting dumber, there are five times as many users as in 2010. Can the platform really keep quality up? What I like to think of as “dumb Twitter” is getting to be a bigger and bigger proportion, and the bigger it gets the more people go silent who are of high quality.

Posting on the Rohingya controversy the last few days hasconvinced me that **most people who express opinions are mostly interested in posturing**. People of conscience can agree that killing of civilians is wrong. But the details of action from that premise vary wildly. Also, my attempt to get at the facts of contextual elements apparently make me suspicious to many people!

In relation to foreign policy, I think that distrusting “elites” is probably for the best. The primary thing they know is their own interests.

[The Last Days of ISIS’ Capital: Airstrikes if You Stay, Land Mines if You Flee](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/world/middleeast/raqqa-isis-islamic-state-syria-airstrikes.html?smid=tw-share).

[PETA versus the postdoc: Animal rights group targets young researcher for first time](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/peta-versus-postdoc-animal-rights-group-targets-young-researcher-first-time). I think this sort of behavior is more acceptable in the world of ‘social media shaming.’

[Americans Losing Faith in College Degrees, Poll Finds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-losing-faith-in-college-degrees-poll-finds-1504776601). Not all Americans:

> Today, Democrats, urban residents and Americans who consider themselves middle- and upper-class generally believe college is worth it; Republicans, rural residents and people who identify themselves as poor or working-class Americans don’t.

Also, colleges don’t get it:

> Schools such as Michigan State, the University of Wisconsin system and > the University of Florida are trying to improve their public standing with **marketing efforts**. In Wisconsin, the university system has taken out billboards across the state highlighting the impact alumni have had on the local economy.

On a related vein, over at Oberlin, [Enrollment Drop Creates Financial Shortfall](https://oberlinreview.org/14052/news/enrollment-drop-creates-financial-shortfall/). In the Pacific Northwest, [After a turbulent spring, Evergreen faces enrollment decline, budget woes](http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article172119647.html). Finally, [Long After Protests, Students Shun the University of Missouri](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/university-of-missouri-enrollment-protests-fallout.html?mcubz=1). Hyper-politicization does not seem good for the product.

Finally, interested readers should consider getting a copy of [Introduction to Quantitative Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0582243025/geneexpressio-20). The next five years or so will be saturated with results coming out of massive genomic studies which will make much more sense if one has a theoretical framework with which to interpret the them.
