In 2546 Richard Dawkins will be remembered for “memes”

  
[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/theselfishgene.jpeg?resize=175%2C287)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/theselfishgene.jpeg?resize=175%2C287)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20)In 2006 *South Park* premiered the episode[Go God Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_God_Go). It synthesized [Buck Rogers in the 25th century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B074NWLRYP/geneexpressio-20), the [Wii craze](https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/14/nintendo-microsoft-update-markets-equity-cx_er_ra_1214markets29.html) of the middle 2000s, and Richard Dawkins’ [God Delusion](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003JTHWJQ/geneexpressio-20) engendered fame (or infamy). In some ways, this was a sad reflection on Dawkins’ reputation, because before he got full-bore into atheist activism he was a great science popularizer, most famously for [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20). Many would contend that George C. Williams’ [Adaptation and Natural Selection](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691026157/geneexpressio-20) outlined [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20)‘s ideas better and earlier, while Dawkins himself is most proud of [The Extended Phenotype](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01K2BLPN2/geneexpressio-20). But warranted or not [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20) stands head and shoulders above his other work in terms of recognition, in large part due to the sexy title (which Dawkins has expressed some ambivalence about due to its misinterpretation).

I now believe that Richard Dawkins’ reputation will hinge on the word and concept of the [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Origins). That is because Dawkins [introduced](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=memetics&year_start=1950&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cmemetics%3B%2Cc0) the idea in [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20) in 1976. Despite Susan Blackmore’s attempt to revive interest in the concept in [The Meme](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00814M2BW/geneexpressio-20) Machine I think it is fair to say that “memetics” as an analog to “genetics” was moribund for several decades. This is not to say that cultural evolution as a field did not exist, but that discipline is distinct from memetics and emerged around the same time as Dawkins’ [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01GI5F2FS/geneexpressio-20).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/extendedphenotype.jpeg?resize=181%2C279)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/extendedphenotype.jpeg?resize=181%2C279)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01K2BLPN2/geneexpressio-20)Today we are in a very different position than 2006. The word “meme” has entered the lexicon. As the Google Trendschart above shows the increase began in the late 2000s, but it is has been rather precipitous of the last decade. Among the younger set, the word meme is not exotic. It’s just another word. In fact, I mentioned offhand to a co-worker that Richard Dawkins invented the neologism and he was incredulous. He simply couldn’t believe it. And that to me illustrates how ubiquitous it’s gotten in a bizarre way. Dawkins is seen as a writer on evolution and religion. Not the originator of such a ubiquitous word.

Of course, memetics and memes as Dawkins originally envisaged them never developed in the way he’d have imagined. But the culture has a knack for evolving in directions we wouldn’t expect….
