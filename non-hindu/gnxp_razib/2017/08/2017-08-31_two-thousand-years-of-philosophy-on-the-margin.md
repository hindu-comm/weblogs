Two thousand years of philosophy on the margin

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/historyofphilosophy.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/historyofphilosophy.jpeg?resize=181%2C278)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199656495/geneexpressio-20)A little less than two years ago I began to read Anthony Kenny’s [A New History of Western Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199656495/geneexpressio-20). It’s a big book, on the order of \~1000 pages. But that’s not the reason I’m just now finishing it. The book is divided by chronologically and thematically. **I read about the ancients in about a week, but struggled to get past the medieval section.** I’ve mentioned this before.

And yet in my self-pity I did wonder: is this partly just a function of the fact that ancient philosophy provided most of the answers (or non-answers) in what we think of as philosophy over a few centuries? As they say, perhaps the rest is simply commentary and extension.

If society collapsed and we reverted to barbarism it seems it would be a loss if we didn’t have the [Principia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011SFJSJO/geneexpressio-20). But if we had philosophy up to Seneca, would we miss what came after?
