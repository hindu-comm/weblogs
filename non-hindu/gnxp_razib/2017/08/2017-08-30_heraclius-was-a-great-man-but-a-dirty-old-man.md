Heraclius was a great man, but a dirty old man

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/byzantinestate.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/byzantinestate.jpeg?resize=183%2C275)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M7SP1L7/geneexpressio-20)The Emperor [Heraclius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius) is someone who more people should know. He saved the Byzantine Empire before it truly became the Byzantine Empire in a mature form. When he took power the Persians were on the march, and ruled vast swaths of the Asian and African possessions of the East Roman Empire. [Theodore of Tarsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_of_Tarsus#Early_life), one of the early Archbishops of Canterbury, grew up under Persian rule. Like Hannibal’s early victories Heraclius’ defeat of the Persians is a tour de force of strategic brilliance. I’ll leave it to the reader to find out why themselves (I recommend [A History of the Byzantine State and Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M7SP1L7/geneexpressio-20) to any reader).

But this post is inspired by pop-culture. People are talking about nephew-aunt relations right now. As it happens Heraclius’ second wife was his niece, Martina. Here is something I found on Wikipedia: “He had two children with Fabia and at least **nine with Martina, most of whom were sickly children…Fabius (Flavius) had a paralyzed neck and Theodosios, who was a deaf-mute….**” The history of this period can be patchy and unreliable. So I’m not sure there were nine children and most were sickly…but probably inbreeding was causing some serious issues.
