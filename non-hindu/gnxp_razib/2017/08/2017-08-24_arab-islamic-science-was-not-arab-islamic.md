Arab Islamic science was not Arab Muslim

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/johnderbyshire.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/johnderbyshire.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00X8EMOPO/geneexpressio-20)Someone stupid who follows me on Twitter said “It seems @razibkhan forgot the Arabs gave us algebra and many other scientific/mathematical advances.” The history of algebra is actually somewhat more antique than the Arabs, as outlined in [Unknown Quantity: A Real and Imaginary History of Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00X8EMOPO/geneexpressio-20). But the origin of the word is Arabic. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra#Etymology):

> The word algebra comes from the Arabic الجبر (al-jabr lit. “the reunion of broken parts”) from the title of the book Ilm al-jabr wa’l-muḳābala by Persian mathematician and astronomer al-Khwarizmi.

It is accurate to say that Arab Islamic civilization was intellectually productive in the centuries before 1000 A.D., but it is not accurate to say that Muslim Arab scholars were responsible for this.

A huge number of these scholars were not ethnic Arabs. In the early years a substantial number were not Muslim. Though it is often said that many were Persian, as recounted in [Lost Enlightenment](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00F8MIJMQ/geneexpressio-20) many of the “Persians” were not from Persia proper, but from Iranian regions of Central Asia which over the centuries have now become Turkified.

Why is this important? The multicultural nature of early Muslim (and later Ottoman) polities might inform us as to the future of this sort of diverse society. Second, it’s preferable that you don’t seem like an idiot if you want me to listen to anything you say.
