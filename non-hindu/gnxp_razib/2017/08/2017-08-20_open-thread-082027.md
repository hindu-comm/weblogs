[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/enigmaofreason.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/enigmaofreason.jpeg?resize=183%2C276)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674368304/geneexpressio-20)I’ve been off the map for a bit because I’m eclipse chasing. \#TotalityOrBust as they say. The whole family has been converging on zone of totality, and now we’re there. Obviously I’m excited.

There are lots of things going on in the world. One thing though that I’m beginning to think is that **people would benefit reading more cognition science.** I know I certainly did years ago. The main issue is that we’re not rational in the way we think we’re rational, and that leads to a lot of confusions why **other** people behave the way they do. Check out [Enigma of Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674368304/geneexpressio-20) (I came upon a lot of this literature through the study of the cognition of religion).

[Complex Patterns of Admixture across the Indonesian Archipelago](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msx196/3952785/Complex-Patterns-of-Admixture-across-the). Someone who knows archaeology should read this….

[The genetic history of Ice Age Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27135931). This was published last year. But it should be re-read. Closely.
