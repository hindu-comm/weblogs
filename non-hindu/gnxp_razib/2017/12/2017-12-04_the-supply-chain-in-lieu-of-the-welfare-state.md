The supply chain in lieu of the welfare state

*The Wall Street Journal*, of all places, has a fascinating human interest piece on Dollar General which is dense with insight, [How Dollar General Became Rural America’s Store of Choice](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-dollar-general-became-rural-americas-store-of-choice-1512401992):

> The local Dollar General store, built on a rural highway and > surrounded by farmland, sells no fresh meat, greens or fruit. Yet the > 7,400-square-foot steel-sided store has most of what Eddie Watson > needs. >
> … >
> Dollar General Corp.’s 14,000 stores yielded more than double the > profit of Macy’s Inc. on less revenue during its most recent fiscal > year. And its \$22 billion market value eclipses the largest U.S. > grocery chain, Kroger Co., which has five times the revenue. >
> … >
> The more the rural U.S. struggles, company officials said, the more > places Dollar General has found to prosper. **“The economy is > continuing to create more of our core customer,”** Chief Executive > Todd Vasos said in an interview at the company’s Goodlettsville, > Tenn., headquarters. >
> … >
> Dollar General’s typical shopper “doesn’t look at her pantry or her > refrigerator and say, ‘You know, I’m going to be out of ketchup in the > next few days. I’m going to order a few bottles,’” said Mr. Vasos, the > company’s chief executive. “The core customer uses the last bit of > ketchup at the table the night prior, and either on her way to work or > on her way home picks up one bottle.” >
> Camouflage is a proven winner. This year, Dollar General became the > exclusive seller of dog food from the camouflage-gear brand Mossy Oak. > “Even off-brand camo does well here,” said the Evensville store > manager Justin Ray, who has a display of camouflage merchandise, > including pacifiers and pet toys.
