Niall of the Nine Hostages and DNAGeeks

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/m222.jpg?resize=250%2C250)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/m222.jpg?resize=250%2C250)](https://dnageeks.com/collections/haplotees-special-edition/products/the-r1b-m222-haplotee?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017)The past 5 weeks have been a whirlwind. In starting [DNAGeeks](https://dnageeks.com/?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017) we wanted to share our passion for genomics, and also tap into other people’s passions. That has meant rolling out products related to [genetic genealogy](https://dnageeks.com/collections/maternal-haplotees?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017), [inside jokes about science](https://dnageeks.com/collections/science-tees/products/reviewer-3?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017), or more [pointed commentary](https://dnageeks.com/collections/science-tees/products/you-have-died-of-peer-review?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017) about the state of a scientific career. Hopefully, all of this gets people talking and spreads awareness and interest in genetic testing, as well as science in general (something I’ve tried to do with the blog obviously).

We want folks to know that science is serious but can also be fun. The genetic genealogy community synthesizes both a passion for science and a deep humanism. When we rolled out our [Haplotees](https://dnageeks.com/collections/paternal-haplotees?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017) we focused on the broadest haplogroup lineages, paternal and maternal.

Now as we gain traction, **we are trying to delve deep into specific historical stories.** Recently, in collaboration with an early supporter of [DNAGeeks](https://dnageeks.com/?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017) , we developed the [R1b-M222 Haplotee](https://dnageeks.com/collections/haplotees-special-edition/products/the-r1b-m222-haplotee?utm_source=gnxp&utm_medium=m222_blog11042017) which highlights the lineage of men descended from [Niall of the Nine Hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_of_the_Nine_Hostages). It’s a fascinating story of one dude that fathered tons of folks (or more broadly, one of the major lineages of the Sons of Mil)…. This is what we mean that the passion for genetics is deep, as these sorts of topics combine the latest science with history and great personal stories. In the future, **with greater feedback from the community**, we hope to roll-out other offerings, tailored to the interests and passions of specific groups.

We want to hear from you. Get in touch in the comments below. We are now developing our “roadmap” for the next year so feedback has, and will, make a difference.

(I like the idea of Genghis Khan shirt but wonder about the market size)
