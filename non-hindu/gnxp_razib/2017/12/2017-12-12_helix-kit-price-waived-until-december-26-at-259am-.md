Helix kit price waived until December 26 at 2:59am EST

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/regionalancestry.jpg?resize=300%2C224)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/regionalancestry.jpg?resize=300%2C224)](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=social)Happy Hanukkah! My main qualm with wishing you a happy holiday is that I’m a thorough assimilator and I don’t want to be disemboweled.

For the context, listen to the [Stuff You Missed in History Class](https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/maccabean-revolt.htm) episode on the [Maccabean Revolt](https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/maccabean-revolt.htm). As a Jewish friend of mine once observed, the Maccabees were kind of the Al-Qaeda of their day (today she would have said ISIS).

With that out of the way, I want to give you a heads up that Helix has a sale going until December 26 at 2:59am EST **where the \$80 kit cost for purchase of any app is waived if you haven’t purchased at app before.** Just enter the promotion code **HOLIDAY** at checkout.

That means presales of Insitome’s [Regional Ancestry](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-regional-ancestry?utm_campaign=insitome-regional-ancestry&utm_content=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=social) is no more than \$19.99, while [Neanderthal](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=social) is \$29.99 and [Metabolism](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-metabolism?utm_campaign=insitome-metabolism&utm_content=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_medium=social) is \$39.99 (this applies to all of Helix’s products except embodyDNA by Lose It! and Geno 2.0 by National Geographic).

Why does it matter? Again, **Helix banks a high quality exome+ (the + is for non-exonic positions) when you purchase any of their apps**. If you want subsequent apps you don’t have to sent another kit in, you just buy the app and get the results. Also, I do have to say that from what I’ve seen and heard Helix’s laboratory facilities are top-notch in terms of getting results turned around rapidly.
