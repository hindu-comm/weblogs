Perhaps then the folkway of the nomadic Turk was sublimated and integrated into the Islamic superstructure of the Ottoman ruling ideology?

I went to a work-related Christmas party thrown by my company’s law firm. There were a lot of VC guys there. Two of them confused me for a blockchain entrepreneur(one of them was asking about a conflict with the CFO). I think I better get into blockchain….

I only know about this website because of conservative Twitter. **It could be that 90% or more of the hits on this website are through viral “hate-clicks”.**

Second, I feel the image that goes along with the article is **problematic** as fuck. The woman pictured seems to be geared toward appealing to cishet male norms of “attractiveness.” On the other hand, if intersectional feminists typically look something like [Josie Maran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Maran#/media/File:Josie_Maran.jpg)…well, I won’t go there.

I will observe also that I find out about a lot of far-right movements and individuals through Left and Centrist Twitter (the two groups are interested for different reasons).

As noted in the comments, [The Irish DNA Atlas: Revealing Fine-Scale Population Structure and History within Ireland](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17124-4). At this point, I think I can say this: **unless it’s ancient DNA I’m done with the historical genetics of the British Isles.** We know enough. Period.

[Why the \#MeToo Movement Should Be Ready for a Backlash](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/10/yoffe-sexual-harassment-college-franken-216057). I don’t care too much about Al Franken, but digging a little deeper I think there might be some dirty tricks going on there…. I was rather dim on the prospects for Republicans in 2018, but at this rate, the Dems might “struggle-session” their way into defeat.

When I believed in the [End of History and the Last Man](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003DYGOQO/geneexpressio-20) this would matter to me. Now it’s all a big shrug.

There can be no genetic test for being Hispanic because that is a socio-cultural identity. There are Korean, Arab, and Nordic Hispanics. Even the most common genetic profile varies, from mostly European Argentines to mostly indigenous Bolivians to Afro-Cubans and Afro-Colombians.

When I read stuff like this I really wonder what they teach journalists (the Census explicitly declaims the the idea that Hispanic is a racial category).

I spent a fair amount of time this weekend cleaning up scripts that can batch process [23andMe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ5K87Z/geneexpressio-20), [Ancestry](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00TRLVKW0/geneexpressio-20) and [FamilyTree DNA](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B072K6PGRF/geneexpressio-20) input files and push them down the pipeline toward generating admixture percentages. I have posted the [most current results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124F0p1foJpnSt2DJcmo_cgxhq1sht34WLErxU9TJuRw/edit#gid=1109543936) from the [South Asian Genotype Project](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/12/02/south-asian-genotype-project/) have been posted.

Two things

1\) I’m not happy with the clusters that I used. I may change them (in which case I’ll rerun everything).  
2) Once I’ve done that I’ll probably send some of my scripts to Zack Ajmal and he can run all the Harappa individuals with this new cluster.

Finally, **people from the “Cow Belt” don’t get genotyped.** No submissions from UP or Bihar so far. Very frustrating.

The word [problematic](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=problematic&geo=US&date=all#TIMESERIES) is problematic in my opinion. I really want to punch people when they use that word. But I’ve lost that battle.

- [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the
  Future](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00J6YBOFQ/geneexpressio-20).
  I admire Peter Thiel much more than I did a few years ago. - [To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern

  I enjoyed reading [The First Three
  Minutes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001F0PYX2/geneexpressio-20),
  but generally am out of sync with Weinberg’s full-throated scientism
  when I hear his public pronouncements. But that’s OK, I read people I
  disagree with. - [Venomous: How Earth’s Deadliest Creatures Mastered
  Biochemistry](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B018E7HFNK/geneexpressio-20).
  Real biology and chemistry. Sometimes I miss them. - [The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth
  Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00H5ZN2Z8/geneexpressio-20).
  This has been in my stack for a **long** time (3.5 years). - [The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living
