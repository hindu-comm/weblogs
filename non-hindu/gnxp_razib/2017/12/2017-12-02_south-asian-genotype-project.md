South Asian Genotype Project

It’s been a few years since I’ve done any serious “Genome Blogging.” Mostly I’ve been very busy and there isn’t much low-hanging fruit left as it is. **But today I want to announce that I’ll be running the generically titled “South Asian Genotype Project.”**

The way it works is simple: **send me a 23andMe, Ancestry, or Family Tree DNA raw genotype file to contactgnxp-at- gmail.com (though 23andMe’s new chip has far less overlap with other platforms earlier, so probably best if you were typed before August 2017).**

In the subject please put:

1.  “South Asian Genotype Project” 2.  The state/province your family is from 3.  Ethnolinguistic group 4.  If applicable, caste

In the body of the email you can put Y and mtDNA and any other information you want. Obviously your data is **confidential** and I won’t identify you by name, just ethnolinguistic group and such.

Since the last time I did this I have some scripts that make this a lot of easier, so hopefully I’ll be adding individuals to this [spreadsheet every few days](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/124F0p1foJpnSt2DJcmo_cgxhq1sht34WLErxU9TJuRw/edit?usp=sharing). I’ll give project members an ID and try to email them when the results are up.

The main motivator for this project on my part is that people still ask me questions about Sinhalese, Nasrani Christians, and other assorted groups which we don’t have answers to because current research projects haven’t focused on them.

Since Zack worked on the [Harappa Ancestry Project](http://www.harappadna.org/) we know a lot more about South Asian ancestry. Basically, there is an ANI-ASI cline, and some South Asians have exogenous ancestry off this cline. Indian Jews have Middle Eastern ancestry, while Bengalis have East Asian ancestry, and some groups in Pakistan have African ancestry. With that in mind I’ll be testing a smaller number of populations. The marker set is 240,000 SNPs by the way.

**Below are some representative results.** You can see that my results from three DTC services are basically the same. Also, some South Indian groups (see Pulliyar) show “Dai” ancestry, when I’m pretty sure it’s just that I didn’t sample as much on the extreme portion of the ASI-cline.
