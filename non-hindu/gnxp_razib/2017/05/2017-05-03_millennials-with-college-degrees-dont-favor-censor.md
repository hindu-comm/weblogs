Millennials with college degrees don’t favor censorship

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/71859OMzmQL.jpg?resize=200%2C300)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/71859OMzmQL.jpg?resize=200%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GVRE638//geneexpressio-20)There’s a specter haunting the academy. **The specter of “red guards” destroying lives and tearing down Western civilization and all its accomplishments in the interests of antinomian leveling impulses through denunciationsand purges.** (here is the latest [instance](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html); the whole thing leaves me yawning, because too few people have the courage or gall to stand up for what they know is right, so this will happen again and again and again)

I am plain in my view that this is a problem. Some of my friends in the academy agree, but in the end they make different choices about priorities. Others don’t think this is a problem at all (and honestly, they clearly think that free speech is more about speech that they think is acceptable). Ultimately I don’t think that this will end well; I’m most [certainly going to be on the other side](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2017/04/11/living-as-loki-friendship-before-ragnarok/) of people whom I consider friends if and when the end of our current liberal democratic order collapses of its own contradictions.

But this isn’t about that. Rather, it’s about an aspect of it: are Millennials, those born after 1980, who go to college more opposed to freedom of speech than previous generations? Is this what’s driving the flair up of campus events? **The answer, as clear in the GSS is that Millennials who have gone to college are not more censorious**.

The GSS has a variable,SPKRAC. It asks:

> …. consider a person who believes that Blacks are genetically inferior. a. If such a person wanted to make a speech in your community claiming that Blacks are inferior, should he be allowed to speak, or not?

Should this person be allowed to speak? **As you can see above there is hardly any difference between people of different generations if they have a college education on this question.\*** The big difference is between generations among those who have a high school education or less. I think this is simply due to the reality that if you have only a high school education as a Millennial you’re much more likely to be not very intelligent in relation to older generations. The slight decline for college educated Millennials might be due to this effect as well, and more marginal kids are now going to, and finishing, college.

If you do a logistic regression in the GSS you see what I have reported earlier: **both education and intelligence have independent and notable impacts predicting support of free speech to a liberal extent.** Being a woman usually correlates with lower tolerance of deviant or abhorrent speech. Socioeconomic status, income, and age, don’t really matter too much when other variables are accounted for.

What about politics? The results might surprise you.

**As you can see on the whole liberals are the most supportive of free speech for racists**. It does look that there has been some regression since the ***real*** “greatest generation.” And as I expected moderates are the least tolerant.

Moderates are usually less intelligent (this is easily confirmed with the GSS) and informed, and they’re conformists. Today racism is in bad odor, so their instinct to ban or restrict it is strong, as opposed to the abstract principle of free speech. This impulse probably explains the declines broadly among Millennials.

But the results at the top indicate that university education may actually inoculate a bit against this! (remember, it’s not just intelligence, as university education had an independent effect on opinions in the regression)

There’s something going on. It’s a problem. Perhaps a big problem. I do think it ultimately threatens the credibility of the academy in a way we haven’t seen in generations. **But it’s not because the majority of students agree with driving speakers they don’t like off the campus or banning speech they find hurtful**. A minority of students are loud, mobilized, and active. Sometimes minorities can shape history….

\* I limited the sample to non-Hispanic whites. I used the variables SPKRAC, COHORT and DEGREE. I recombined some. E.g., COHORT(r:1800-1945″pre-Boomer”;1946-1964″Boomer”;1965-1980″GenX”;1981-\*”Millennial”). Adding groups besides non-Hispanic whites didn’t change the qualitative result, though support for free speech declines among minorities.
