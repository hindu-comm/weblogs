The above talk from David Reich is very good. Highly recommended.

Chris Wickham’s [Medieval Europe](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01LZ01AC8/geneexpressio-20) is pretty good, though it is very similar to his [The Inheritance of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143117424/geneexpressio-20) and [Framing the Early Middle Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199212961/geneexpressio-20).

[Rod Dreher](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/black-like-me-dreher-dna/) finds out it is highly like he has some African ancestry from a slave ancestor. This seems to be detected in 1 out of 10 whites using reasonable thresholds. Probably that that means that **genealogically** much more than 10% of Louisiana whites have lines of descent from people who were mixed-race slaves (though in French areas it might be mediated often by mixing with “free people of color”).
