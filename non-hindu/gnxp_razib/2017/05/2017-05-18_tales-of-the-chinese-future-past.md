Tales of the Chinese future past

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9815922.jpg?resize=268%2C400)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9815922.jpg?resize=268%2C400)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009Z777Z0/geneexpressio-20)In the first half of the 1990s I was an avid reader of David Wingrove’s [Chung Kuo](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B016ZGZFRK/geneexpressio-20) series. This is before I knew much about Chinese history, or much about life to be honest. This vast epic future history is set ina world where a resurgent China dominates the world. Wars of genocidal extermination against the black and brown peoples, as well as the Japanese, have left the ethnographic topography rather simpler. Europeans exist as a subaltern race in the techno-Confucian order.

The Chinese hegemony erases the true history of the human past and promulgates a fictional alternative history, which the populace acceptsas the truth. In this telling the semi-legendary Chinese general who was turned away by the Parthians 2,000 years ago continues westward, and ultimately China conquers Rome. All institutional organized religion is obliterated from existence and memory; no Christianity, no Buddhism. It is as if the Former Han dynasty had access to 21st century technology.

Earthis ruled by a small oligarchy of virtuous monarchs. Progress is dampened in the interests of social stability. The world is explicitly stratified into classes, though there is some mobility upward and downward within a single generation. They know their world’s history is a foundation of lies, **but lies are seen as critical to social harmony and stability**. The truth may set people free, butthis is not a world where freedom is the primary value. Rather, stability and social harmony are prized.

Truth, progress, and individualism.

Reading this series in the first half of the 1990s as a teenager it all seemed fantastical. Liberalism, Western liberalism, [was inevitable](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009Z777Z0/geneexpressio-20) as humanity’s terminal state. We all knew that. As the Chinese grew wealthier the expectation by many was that they would begin to inch toward Western norms and institutions, just as the collapsing Soviet Union was. **The very concept of a jarring lateral shift in norms, values, and *Weltanschauung*, was quite literally the stuff of science fiction!**

I nowbelieve that I was very wrong about many things back then, and David Wingrove’s fertile imagination grasped far deeper, and perhaps troubling, possibilities about the arrow of history. In 2011, after a 15 year hiatus, Wingrove returned to this series with a prequal, [Son of Heaven](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009Z777Z0/geneexpressio-20). It is perhaps an appropriate time for me at this juncture to revisit this world, and even look at it with more sympathy as an adult than I did as a child.

Of course I’ll also be re-reading my [Xunzi](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M/geneexpressio-20). In translation I feel as if I’m missing but, but my hope is that re-reading will allow me to gain insight. Unfortunately I am hopeless at languages, otherwise I would attempt to learn to read Mandarin at this advanced age.
