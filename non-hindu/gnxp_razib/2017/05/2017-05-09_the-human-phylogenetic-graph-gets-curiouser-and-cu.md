The human phylogenetic graph gets curiouser and curiouser

While most of my readers were sleeping, Lee Berger in South Africa was giving a press conferences on new *Homo naledi* related results. Three [papers](https://elifesciences.org/) are in elife. It’s open access, so read yourself. The major result is that the fossils have been dated to a 236,000 to 335,000 years ago.

If you aren’t a paleontologist, [Homo naledi and Pleistocene hominin evolution in subequatorial Africa](https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e24234):

The existence of a diverse array of > hominins in subequatorial comports with our present knowledge of > diversity across other savanna-adapted species, as well as with > palaeoclimate and paleoenvironmental data. *H. naledi* casts the fossil and archaeological records into a new light, as we cannot exclude that this lineage was responsible for the production of Acheulean or Middle Stone Age tool industries.

In relation to the DNA part, we don’t have ancient genomes except for the Ethiopian Holocene one. They couldn’t get DNA out of *naledi*. But we do have inferences made from modern populations. Here is the most recent paper cited, [Model-based analyses of whole-genome data reveal a complex evolutionary history involving archaic introgression in Central African Pygmies](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/3/291).
