Normally a conference or a talk related to the [Bell Beakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_culture)and their spread across Western Europe would involve a few presentation slides with pictures of beakers and shaded maps, and result in the production of a scholarly compendium such as [The Bell Beaker Transition in Europe: Mobility and local evolution during the 3rd millennium BC](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1782979271/geneexpressio-20). From the description on Amazon in relation to this book:

> Could the circulation of objects or ideas and the mobility of artisans > explain the unprecedented uniformity of the material culture observed > throughout the whole of Europe? The 17 papers presented here offer a > range of new and different perspectives on the Beaker phenomenon > across Europe. The focus is not on Bell Beaker pottery but on social > groups (craft specialists, warriors, chiefs, extended or nuclear > families), using technological studies and physical anthropology to > understand mobility patterns during the 3rd millennium BC. > Chronological evolution is used to reconstruct the rhythm of Bell > Beaker diffusion and the environmental background that could explain > this mobility and the socioeconomic changes observed during this > period of transition toward Bronze Age societies. The chapters are > mainly organized geographically, covering Eastern Europe, the > Mediterranean shores and the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, > includes some areas that are traditionally studied and well known, > such as France, the British Isles or Central Europe, but also others > that have so far been considered peripheral, such as Norway, Denmark > or Galicia. This journey not only offers a complex and diverse image > of Bell Beaker societies but also of a supra-regional structure that > articulated a new type of society on an unprecedented scale.

Pretty dry. **But thankfully in lieu of PowerPoint slides some researchers have gotten more clever, and in light of new findings I present a short film depicting the Bell Beaker arrival in what became Britain.** Pretty quick turnaround, no?
