[We’re Getting Awfully Close to Full Employment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/upshot/were-getting-awfully-close-to-full-employment.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news):

> The headline numbers for April are terrific. The economy added 211,000 > jobs in April, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent. That is not just the lowest jobless rate in a decade; it also matches the lowest level reached during the mid-2000s expansion. The last time it was lower was May 2001, 16 full years ago.

This is not surprising, as I take [the end of work](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/) seriously as a thesis. **But, I have to admit that in 2008 we’d probably be surprised that nearly a decade of very modest economic growth on a yearly basis has led us here.**

I remember listening to commentators in the dark years right after the financial downtown explaining how many quarters of job growth would be needed for us to reach \~4 percent employment. It just seemed implausible to them at that time, and I have to say that I probably agreed with them on some level. But here we are.

But whenever there is exuberance about full employment and [trillion dollar companies](http://fortune.com/2017/03/31/amazon-stock-trillion-dollar-company-apple-tesla-google/) I start to wonder if perhaps we’re living before the fall. Are we going to go into a recession soon? I suspected something was off in the [spring of 2007](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/05/05/recession/)…though my pessimism in 2012 didn’t seem to pan out.
