Applying intelligence to genes for intelligence

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download-4.jpeg?resize=144%2C217)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download-4.jpeg?resize=144%2C217)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2PFJPO/geneexpressio-20)Carl Zimmer has an excellent write up on the new [new](https://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ng.3869)[*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ng.3869) [study](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2PFJPO/geneexpressio-20) of the variants associated with IQ, [In ‘Enormous Success,’ Scientists Tie 52 Genes to Human Intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/science/52-genes-human-intelligence.html).

The issue with intelligence is that it’s a highly polygenic trait for which measurement is not always trivial. You need really large sample sizes. It’s about ten times less tractable than height as a quantitative trait. There are still many arguments about its genetic nature (though a majority position that it’s not rare variants of large effect seems to be emerging).

But all in good time.

Science is divided into many different fiefdoms, and people don’t always talk to each other. For example I know a fair number of population genomicists, and I know behavior geneticists who utilize quantitative genomic methods. The two are distinct and disparate groups. **But the logic of cheap sequencing and big data is impacting both fields**.

When it comes to the behavior geneticists many come out of psychology backgrounds, so they are not conversant in aspects of genetic theory which harbor no utility for their tasks at hand. This leads to all sorts of problems, especially when journalists go to get comments from researchers who are really opiningout of domain.

Some writers, such as Carl Zimmer, are very punctilious about the details. Getting things right. But we have to be cautious, because many journalists prefer a truth-themed story to the truth retold in a story format. And, some journalists are basically propagandists.

Over the next five years you will see many “gene and IQ” studies come out, with progressively greater and greater power. Read the write-ups in*The New York Times*,*Science*, and*Nature*. But to my many readers with technical skills this is what you should really do:

1.  ***pull down the data.*** 2.  ***re-analyze it.***

I’m a big fan of people educating themselves on topics which they have opinions on (see: population genetics). If intelligence is of some interest to you, you should read some things. Arthur Jensen’s classic [The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0275961036/geneexpressio-20) can be quite spendy (though used copies less so). But Stuart Ritchie’s [Intelligence: All That Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00RTY0LPO/geneexpressio-20) and Richard Haier’s [The Neuroscience of Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2PFJPO/geneexpressio-20) are both good, and cheaper and shorter. They hit all the basics which educated people should know if they want to talk about the topic of intelligence in an analytical way.
