The end of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saudirabia.jpeg?resize=175%2C288)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/saudirabia.jpeg?resize=175%2C288)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B007MDK5GM/geneexpressio-20)The most important thing happening in the world that is different this week from last week from what I can tell is that the the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is going “full Ishmael” on us. By this I mean the reference in the Hebrew Bible to Abraham’s firstborn son, Ishmael, and the legendary ancestor of the Arabs: “And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him….”

What’s going on now? As you know there seems to be an internal purge going on, and a centralization of power around the Crown Prince. This, after the rollback of the power of the religious establishment.

Externally the quagmire in Yemen continues, and the Saudi state is now becoming more belligerent toward both Iran and Lebanon.

Most of you probably know the general issues about why the Saudi state is attempting to change and reform. Though petroleum will remain important for plastics and jet fuel, it is quite possible that the proportion used for gasoline will decline with the rise of electric cars. Additionally, there seem more supply-side possibilities with fracking technologies.

But perhaps the **biggest factors are demographic**. Over ten years ago Peter Turchin wrote a paper, [Scientific Prediction in Historical Sociology: Ibn Khaldun meets Al Saud](http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Turchin_AlSaud2006.pdf). It’s pretty useful in understanding what’s going on right now. The big issue which Turchin talks about more generally and is relevant to Saudi Arabia is **elite overproduction.** The Royal House is highly fecund. And all the scions demand unsustainable leisured lives….
