Our time in the sun

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tarsier.jpeg?resize=275%2C183)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tarsier.jpeg?resize=275%2C183)*The New York Times* has a story up, [After the Dinosaurs’ Demise, Many Mammals Seized the Day](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/science/dinosaurs-mammals-daytime.html?hpw&rref=science&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well). It’s a write-up of a new paper that is open access, [Temporal niche expansion in mammals from a nocturnal ancestor after dinosaur extinction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0366-5).

This research illustrates how computational power has changed evolutionary biology. There has long been an intuitive verbal model that mammals were ancestrally night-adapted creatures based on aspects of their biology, as well as the evolutionary reality that for most of the lineages’ existence they were overshadowed by dinosaurs (remember, more than half of our [evolutionary history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal#Origins) predates the Cenozoic).

Obviously, the emergence of powerful computers accessible to all really changed the game in terms of analytic power.

And yet I wonder about the sense of precision that people gain from these methods. Verbal models are necessarily vague. When you give a probability of a given hypothesis being 0.71, that gives understanding a solidity. But is it warranted? Though researchers understand all the individual moving parts of the phylogenetic framework, only a computer can really bring it all together.

It’s something to consider. This is to a great extent the future of evolutionary biology. Positing models, and put it into a calculating machine like Leibniz dreamed of.

**Addendum:** This is stupid of me, but only after reading the above paper did I reflect that most amniotes are diurnal and that mammals are the exception. Think about it, birds. And reptiles are probably more sluggish at night.
