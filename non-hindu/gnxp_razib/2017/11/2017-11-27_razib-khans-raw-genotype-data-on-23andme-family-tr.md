Razib Khan’s raw genotype data on 23andMe, Family Tree DNA, Geno 2.0 and Ancestry

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/family_tree_guide.jpeg?resize=196%2C257)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/family_tree_guide.jpeg?resize=196%2C257)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M0S7C6U/geneexpressio-20)It has been a while since I posted an update on my genotype. Since then**I’ve been tested on most of the major platforms.** I don’t see any harm in releasing this to the public or researchers who want to look at it (though I don’t know why anyone would).

You can download all the files[here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/44887jjsqyrzdkt/AADF-BQ368zSWlnaYQRUTp2Pa?dl=0).

Having my genotypes public is pretty useful for me. If I inquire about someone’s genetics oftentimes people get weirdly defense and ask “what about you?” I Just invite them to look at my raw data and analyze it for themselves! I’m not a hypocrite about this.

Over the years I’ve had researchers inquire about my ethnicity when they stumble upon my genotype on platforms such as [openSNP](https://opensnp.org/). So in full disclosure, most of my ancestry is pretty standard eastern Bengali. I’m more East Asian shifted than most Bangladeshi samples in the 1000 Genomes project, but then my family is from Comilla, in the far east of eastern Bengal (anyone who cares, my Y is ofcourse R1a1a-Z93 and my mtDNA U2b).
