Dodging the Apple Premium (still)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/download-2.jpeg?resize=212%2C238)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/download-2.jpeg?resize=212%2C238)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06Y14T5YW/geneexpressio-20)Because of what I have been provided by my employers over the last few years I’ve been working on a [Macbook Pro](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071JNRK1V/geneexpressio-20). These are fine machines, but they have not converted me to being a convert to all things Apple. I have two machines with Ubuntu at home that I have no problem with using (one of them has a dual-boot where I have a copy of Windows which I use every six months or so to make sure that security updates are installed).

In any case, my current phone has been acting erratically over the past few weeks. Up until now I had been resisting getting a new phone because it wasn’t as if I really needed one…but when there is a jeopardy that your phone will decide to not boot up, one has to act.

So I was agonizing over the [Samsung 8](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06Y14T5YW/geneexpressio-20) or [iPhone 8](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075QJSQLH/geneexpressio-20). I’ve had multiple Samsung’s before. And the[Samsung 8](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06Y14T5YW/geneexpressio-20)seemed fine. The flip side is that everyone in my office uses an[iPhone 8](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075QJSQLH/geneexpressio-20), and I get crap for staying with Android. This is not a major issue…but I can’t lie, I’m curious about the iPhone.

In the end, I probably stayed with Android for one primary reason: **people in the Apple ecosystem seem totally hostage to Apple**. Upgrades are a total pain, and there are minor things I need to get fixed in regards to my[Macbook Pro](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071JNRK1V/geneexpressio-20)‘s OS which is going to require a “Genius.” The whole situation strikes me as farcical and not futuristic. I’d rather tinker with my Ubuntu distribution than wait in line at a crowded Mac store.

So pass for now….
