My son in the genetics history books

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dnastoryofagenetic.jpeg?resize=202%2C250)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dnastoryofagenetic.jpeg?resize=202%2C250)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KE61LO8/geneexpressio-20)Just saw today that my [son’s prenatal sequencing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/527936/for-one-baby-life-begins-with-genome-revealed/) was mentioned in [DNA: The Story of the Genetic Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KE61LO8/geneexpressio-20):

> The ethics of sequencing a presumably health fetus will be debated for > years to come. But the day of doing is already here. Razib Khan, a > thirty-something graduate student and blogger, decided to sequence his > **first child’s** genome while his wife was still pregnant. Although one instance of whole-genome sequencing in utero was reported in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in 2012, that had been done to supplement a positive cytogenetic result….

I want to correct the record for future printings: **my first son was my second child.**And, it was not my decision, it was **our** decision. My wife was an equal partner, and did as much behind the scenes in making the sequencing happen.
