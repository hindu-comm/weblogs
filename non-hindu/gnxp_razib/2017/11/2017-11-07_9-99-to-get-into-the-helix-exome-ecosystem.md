$9.99 to get into the Helix exome ecosystem

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/neanderthalinsitome.jpg?resize=300%2C483)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/neanderthalinsitome.jpg?resize=300%2C483)](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal/?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=early-bird&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)Will try to keep self-interested product placement to a minimum normally, but I thought I’d pass on that [Helix](https://www.helix.com/shop/) has a \$100 off sale for the next 72 hours. That means that the company [I work for](https://www.insito.me/sample) has a [Neanderthal app](https://www.helix.com/shop/insitome-neanderthal/?utm_campaign=insitome-neanderthal&utm_content=early-bird&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) on sale for \$9.99. The regular price is \$29.99, and added \$80.00 for exome+ sequencing if you aren’t in the Helix database (which most people are not).

The upshot here is that the \$9.99 will get you an exome+ sequence, which at some point in early 2018 you can download for \$600. But if you don’t want to download it it’s a great way to get into the ecosystem on-the-cheap.

I assume most of my readers know what the exome is, but it’s basically the portion of your genome which is directly translated into functional proteins. That’s about \~1% of the genome, or \~30,000,000 bases. This is a major expansion on the SNP-chip platforms which are DTC which are in the 500,000 to 1,000,000 SNP range.

Anyway, not sure this will be appealing to readers who need a full download of data. But if you are the type who is more interested in getting applications related to your genome, this is a pretty good deal at a sub-\$10 price point.

**Note**: To my knowledge only ships to USA currently.
