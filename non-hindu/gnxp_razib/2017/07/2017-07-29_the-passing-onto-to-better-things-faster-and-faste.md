The passing onto to better things…faster and faster

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shuffle.jpeg?resize=247%2C120)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shuffle.jpeg?resize=247%2C120)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011QIIW54/geneexpressio-20)As many of you know, Apple is doing away with the [iPod Shuffle](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011QIIW54/geneexpressio-20). One curious thing is that I’ve noticed several people buying these devices in the last week through my [Amazon referrals](https://www.amazon.com/?&tag=geneexpressio-20&camp=228761&creative=535969&linkCode=ur1&adid=0KN98518YHHBWK1HQWM1&). At \$50 the price point isn’t high, but it does seem a bit much for an obsolete technology.

Which made me reflect on how quickly technologies become obsolete now. As the few people who read this blog **and** know me in real life are aware, **between 2007 and 2014 I went everywhere with a Shuffle.** I always had a backup Shuffle. This is not because I’m an audiophile. I’m not. I listened to podcasts.

Ultimately what made me dump the Shuffle is that I went full d-bag and started doing the bluetooth thing. All of a sudden it didn’t matter where the phone was. I still have a Shuffle, but it’s in a drawer somewhere. Perhaps I have a backup too. I don’t recall.

I probably stuck with the Shuffle longer than most. As an old(er) person I’m reflecting now how fast “ubiquitous” technologies are getting obsolete. Faster and faster.

By the early 2000s VCRs were in decline, with DVD rentals [surpassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder#Decline) VHS in 2003. Cassettes were eclipsed by CDs in the early 1990s after a two decade reign, but CDs really didn’t master the space for more than ten years (at least in the USA). DVDs had a similarly short “moment.”

How much more can change though? Some of the transition occurred because smartphones, in particular the [iPhone](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M1EXQY4/geneexpressio-20), swallowed up whole sectors (audio and photography). Other changes are due to the utilization of high speed internet for video. We got rid of our television in 2004, and for a while there I felt “out of the loop” on a lot of water cooler conversation. But now television has come to me, as binge watching on Netflix has become common.

What will change next?
