SLC24A5 is very important, but we don’t know why

Prior to that pigmentation genetics was really to a great extent coat color genetics, done in mice and other organisms which have a lot of pelage variation.

Of course there was work on humans, mostly related to melanocortin 1. But more interesting were classical pedigree studies which indicated that the **number of loci controlling variation in pigmentation was not that high.** This, it was a mildly polygenic trait insofar as some large effect quantitative trait loci could be discerned in the inheritance patterns.

From [The Genetics of Human Populations](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486406938/geneexpressio-20), written in the 1960s, but still useful today because of its comprehensive survey of the classical period:

Depending on what study samples you use variance on a locus of*SLC24A5*explains less than 10% or more than 30% of the total variance. But it is probably the biggest effect locus on the whole in human populations when you pool them altogether (obviously it explains little variance in Africans or eastern non-Africans since it is homozygous ancestral by and large in both groups).

One aspect of the derived SNP in this locus is that it seems to be under strong selection. In a European [1000 Genomes](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;r=15:48133787-48134787;v=rs1426654;vdb=variation;vf=991135#population_freq_EUR) sample there are 1003 SNPs of the derived variant, and 3 of the ancestral. Curiously this allele was absent in [Western European Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/10/016477), though it was present in hunter-gatherers on the northern and eastern fringes of the continent. It was also present in [Caucasian hunter-gatherers](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9912) and farmers from the Middle East who migrated to Europe. It seems very likely that these sorts of high frequencies are due to selection in Europe.

The variant is also present in appreciably frequencies in many South Asian populations, and there seems to have been*in situ*[selection](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003912) there too, as well as the Near East. In Ethiopia it also seems to be [under selection](https://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n8/pdf/ejhg2014233a.pdf?origin=ppub).

As are the highlands of Ethiopia. About seven years ago I suggested that rather that UV radiation as such the depigmentation that has occurred across the Holocene might be due to [agriculture and changes in diet](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Razib_Khan/publication/43246829_Diet_disease_and_pigment_variation_in_humans/links/0c96052cd2b6e4762a000000.pdf).

But a new result from southern Africa presented at the SMBE meeting this year suggests that **this can not be a comprehensive answer.** Meng Lin in [Brenna Henn’s lab](https://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/people/) uses a broad panel of KhoeSan populations to find that the derived allele on *SLC24A5* reaches \~40% frequency. Probably a high fraction of West Eurasian admixture in these groups is around \~10% being generous. Where did this allele come from? The results from [Joe Pickrell](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/7/2632.abstract) a few years back are sufficient to explain: **there was a movement of pastoralists with distant West Eurasian ancestry who brought cattle to southern Africa, and so resulted in the ethnogenesis of groups such as the[Nama people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nama_people)** (there is also [Y chromosomal work](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10693.full) by Henn on this).

![Sad human with two derived alleles of SNP of interest](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19030388_10154756135037984_4000225532387223798_n.jpg?resize=200%2C200)

Lin reports that the haplotype around*SLC24A5*is the same one as in Western Eurasia.[Iain Mathieson](http://mathii.github.io/) (who is now at Penn if anyone is looking for something to do in grad school or a post-doc) has told me that the haplotype in the Motala Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and in the hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus are the same. **It seems that this haplotype was widespread early in the Holocene**. Curiously, the Motala hunter-gatherers also carry the East Asian haplotype around their derived*EDAR*variant.

I don’t know what to make of this. My intuition is that if a haplotype like this is so widespread nearly \~10,000 years ago recombination would have broken it apart into smaller pieces so that haplotype structure would be easier to discern. As it is that doesn’t seem to be the case.

And we also don’t know what’s going on with*SLC24A5.*Obviously it impacts skin color. It has been shown to do so in admixed populations. But it is hard to believe that that is the sole target of natural selection here.
