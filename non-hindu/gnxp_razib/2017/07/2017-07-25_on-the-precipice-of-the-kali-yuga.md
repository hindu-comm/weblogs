On the precipice of the Kali Yuga

See [The Idea of Decline in Western History](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003ODIRMS/geneexpressio-20) for a culturally delimited view. But whether it is Pandora opening her box or Eve biting the apple, the concept of an idyllic past and the ripeness of imminent decline seems baked into the cake of human cultural cognition. **It was *always* better in the good old days.**

Of course there is the flip side of those who presume that the Eternal City will continue as it always was unto the end of time. Meanwhile, cornucopian optimists of our modern era, such as Steve Pinker, are the historical aberration. But they are influential in our age.

Tanner Greer has a profoundly pessimistic post up, [Everything is Worse in China](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2017/07/everything-is-worse-in-china.html), which is getting some attention (as I’ve stated before Tanner’s [blog](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com) in general is worth a read). Rod Dreher has two follow up posts in response. First, [A: Confucius, Basically](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/why-is-china-like-that-confucius-basically/), which is somewhat an answer to Tanner. And then an email from [Tanner himself](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/ancient-china-for-modern-conservatives/). It is here that he suggests to Rod’s readers [Xunzi: The Complete Text](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00KUCTP2M/geneexpressio-20). That is all for the good (for a broader view, [A Short History of Chinese Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684836343/geneexpressio-20)).

I am rather pessimistic about the state of American culture and the prospects for the American republic as we have known it. I don’t see any of the major political factions offering up a solution for the impending immiseration of the middle class.

So I look to the east. Much of the history of the world has been a history of Asia, and it seems we are going to go back in that direction. **If we are pessimistic about China, to a great extent we are pessimistic about the world.**

Perhaps then we need to abandon the idol of the nation-state, or in China’s case the nation-civilization. Rod Dreher has the [Benedict Option](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01KUCY7XI/geneexpressio-20) for orthodox Christians\* But we need to think bigger. Men and women of civilized inclinations may need to band together, and form secret societies shielded from the avarice of the institutional engines which channel human passions toward inexorable ends. We need a strategy for living as civilized people in an anarchic world, an archipelago of oligarchy in the [sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGHDwXm6YEU) of [barbarism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIrUHVFkm9A). Sooner, rather than later.

History comes at you fast.

\* I mean here Trinitarian Christians of a traditionalist bent, not Eastern or Oriental Orthodox Christians.
