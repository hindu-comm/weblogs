People who say [George R R Martin’s](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&tag=geneexpressio-20&field-keywords=George+R+R+Martin) work is too dark? They need to really read a bit of [R. Scott Bakker](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_8?url=search-alias%3Daps&&tag=geneexpressio-20field-keywords=r+scott+bakker&sprefix=R+Scott+%2Caps%2C149&crid=1K4R9HD995YW&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ar+scott+bakker), and Martin will seem to like someone who sees the world through rose-colored glasses.

I’m thinking of reading [The Witchwood Crown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01IAUG3FM/geneexpressio-20) later because I might need a pick-me-up after[The Unholy Consult](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01MQY4CA1/geneexpressio-20). I’ve also had [The Wise Man’s Fear](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00475AYJQ/geneexpressio-20) in my Kindle stack for over five years now, but I plan on reading it when Patrick Rothfuss finishes the series with book 3.

Speaking of fantasy, there is a lot of commentary on [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00957T6X6/geneexpressio-20). Always. Some of it is quite dumb. For instance, [Game of Thrones and race: who are the non-white characters and where are they from in the books and show?](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/game-thrones-race-non-white-characters-books-show/) To make a sound argument **you actually need to know something about the books.** The writer does not. For example, “The Targaryen monarchs, who ruled Westeros for hundreds of years but, thanks to their thing for incest, never really bred all that much with the locals.” This is false. [Daenerys is only 1/8th Valyrian](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2016/06/15/daenerys-very-inbred-but-not-very-targaryen/) (at most). Half her recent ancestry is from a First Men house, the Blackwoods (though it surely has much Andal blood too). About 3/8th of her recent ancestry is Dornish, so a mix of Andal, First Men, and Rhoynish.

R. Martin published the first book in the series in 1996. It was on his mind for years before that. Obviously if he was writing these books today he’d tune them so they were more in sync with the cultural politics of the contemporary Left (since that is where his own personal sympathies lie). But it isn’t as if he can go back and rewrite the major characters and add some diversity which some of his fans might now want. The 1990s were a different time. I recall back on some message boards that Renly’s sexual orientation was an issue for some readers. Martin was arguably ahead of the times on that score.

There are fantasy works where the central characters are nonwhite. Both Judith Tarr’s[Avaryan](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DTW5GI2/geneexpressio-20) series and Ursula K. Le Guin’s [Earthsea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008T9L6AM/geneexpressio-20) series have been around for a while. And both these worlds have the added benefit of not being standard Tolkienesque medieval settings.

[Inside Facebook’s Rapid Growth in Austin](https://www.americaninno.com/austin/office-envy/facebooks-rapid-growth-in-austin-and-community-operations-expansion-1/). Their presence is felt.

Really great piece on the working relationship between Motoo Kimura and James F. Crow. About 11 years I emailed Crow 10 questions on a lark. He [responded in less than a day](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/10-questions-for-jim-crow.php). Also, Kimura and Crow’s [An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1932846123/geneexpressio-20) is worth getting (it’s cheap).

[Divorce and Occupation](http://flowingdata.com/2017/07/25/divorce-and-occupation/). No surprise that there’s a correlation between income and divorce rate (negative). But some professions are outliers. Bartender and nurse anesthetists are above the trend line (more divorce than their income predicts). Clerics and actuaries are well below it.

[Postdoctoral positions in human population genomics, nutrigenomics, & association studies](http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/content/jobs) at Cornell in Alon Keinan’s lab.

[How evolution draws trade-offs](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/28/169904).

The [TakingHayekSeriously](https://twitter.com/FriedrichHayek) Twitter account has been passing along pieces and posts around the controversy surrounding Nancy Maclean’s [Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01EH1EL7A/geneexpressio-20). The book is ridiculous. So ridiculous that *Vox* published a piece [Even the intellectual left is drawn to conspiracy theories about the right. Resist them](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/14/15967788/democracy-shackles-james-buchanan-intellectual-history-maclean).

Years ago I actually visited The Center for Study of Public Choice where James Buchanan had his office because my friend Garett Jones had his office there. There’s no conspiracy here, or secret cabals under the radar. Libertarians are by and large a nerdy group of radicals fixated on stuff like the nonaggression principle. Just like you see on the internet. Kooky. Yes. But a cabal? Have you met libertarians? They don’t have the aptitude for that sort of coordination ([Radicals for Capitalism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008CEXQAW/geneexpressio-20) is really the book to understand libertarianism, in particular because Buchanan and public choice theory have a minor role at best to play in libertarianism).

But that doesn’t matter.[Democracy in Chains](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01EH1EL7A/geneexpressio-20)will validate the suspicions and beliefs of many people. And it’s a footnoted academic work. Unless it’s obvious fraud it’s going to be a success in [influencing](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/history/2017/06/james_mcgill_buchanan_s_terrifying_vision_of_society_is_the_intellectual.html) [people](https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/874996286604398593).

Remember that [Arming America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375402101/geneexpressio-20) won the Bancroft Prize for outstanding work of American history in 2000.[Arming America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375402101/geneexpressio-20)was likely a work of fraud in large part. But its thesis, that America’s gun culture did not date to the colonial era, was congenial to the political ideology of many historians. Therefore even though it did not pass the smell test they gave the book [rave reviews](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/88/2/614/773102/Arming-America-The-Origins-of-a-National-Gun?redirectedFrom=PDF). I’d be surprised if [Democracy in Chains](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01EH1EL7A/geneexpressio-20) is a work of fraud. The author just doesn’t know what she’s talking about, but she is telling a story her audience wants to hear, with some academic credibility to boot (and so far historians have supposedly supported her).

[The population genomics of archaeological transition in west Iberia: Investigation of ancient substructure using imputation and haplotype-based methods](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006852). I think these dynamics are going to be relatively common.

I must say, I don’t recommend [All Things Made New: The Reformation and Its Legacy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01J86B2NA/geneexpressio-20). The title suggests a broader work than it is. Far too much space is given to the English Reformation. Just thought I’d mention that.

Broadly agree with the thesis I think…but wondering about the replication of some of the experiments cited.

Also in my stack, [The Red Flag: A History of Communism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01FIKD1ZM/geneexpressio-20).

Andrew Sullivan notices in this week’s [column](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/a-week-of-reckoning.html) that Islam seems to now be untouchable on the Left. This is going to too far, but liberals who express anti-Islamic sentiments are getting rather rare, and though privately many on the Left have serious issues with Islam (I know, because they tell me privately) they’re careful not to say it out loud lest they be attacked as racist. My own view is that there are 1.6 billion Muslims, so it makes sense for the Left to align with them. Isn’t world domination worth a hijab?

[Don’t blame the Empire](https://www.thinkpragati.com/opinion/1863/dont-blame-empire/). Alex Tabarrok takes some deserved shots at Shashi Tharoor’s[An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/938306465X/geneexpressio-20). The anti-colonialism tick often gets out of control among Indians, to the point where all evils are heaped upon the British. This is a major aspect of post-colonialism, which “erases” all identity-forming events before the arrival of Europeans.

[Twitter lost 2 million users in the U.S. last quarter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/27/twitter-lost-2-million-users-in-the-u-s-last-quarter/?utm_term=.efd80419e469). Shit’s getting real Jack. If you use RSS, [subscribe to my feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/RazibKhansTotalFeed)! I also have a [mailing list](http://razib.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=68e76131336a8f29b88c5e5c9&id=4be5c128df), where I’ve sent out exactly one email so far. But if Twitter goes down….

[Can 23andMe Tell Us If Jews Are A Race — And Is That A Good Thing?](https://forward.com/news/377499/can-23andme-tell-us-if-jews-are-a-race-and-is-that-a-good-thing/?attribution=author-article-listing-1-headline) The author interviews scientists who know the science, but he still manages to garble and confuse everything. First, **Ashkenazi Jews descend from a endogamous community which flourished in Central Europe probably no earlier than \~1000 AD.** That is why a Ashkenazi Jewish cluster emerges naturally out of the population genetic data; there’s a real coherent demographic history being reflected. Whether that’s a “race” or not I’ll leave to the reader.

Second, the story states that “Sephardic Jews are not considered a distinct population by either company, or by researchers — their genetic make-up is not sufficiently different from surrounding North African, Iberian and Greek populations.” **This very misleading.** To a great extent Sephardic Jews are rather distinct from the surrounding populations. There is *some* evidence of shared ancestry in Moroccan Jews with Moroccan Berbers (I know because I’ve looked at a lot of this data), but it’s a small proportion. Similar things can be said about most Sephardic communities. But, they are not nearly as coherent a genetic cluster as Ashkenazi Jews. There has been some gene flow and assimilation with many local Jewish populations (e.g., the Syrian Sephardic Jews absorbed a local Levantine Jewish community, which had its own liturgy until the 19th century).

[Neanderthal-Derived Genetic Variation Shapes Modern Human Cranium and Brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06587-0#comment-3438997356). Many people skeptical of the robustness of this result.
