The case against nutrition “science”

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/41BNE5G1gZL._SX332_BO1204203200_.jpg?resize=300%2C448)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/41BNE5G1gZL._SX332_BO1204203200_.jpg?resize=300%2C448)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01DRXCPJ0/geneexpressio-20)My attitude toward nutrition science is to be skeptical of everything. I am of the generation that lived through the [SnackWells](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MYRXWOS/geneexpressio-20) fat-free cookie craze (demand was so high at one point that there was a problem with continuous understocking). A friend who is a professor of biology once admitted to me that part of him feels somewhat bad for anti-vaccination believers, **because when it comes to nutrition he and many of his colleagues take a very jaundiced view of any orthodoxy.** The surfeit of observational studies combined with the huge revenues at stake mean that skepticism is warranted.

This puts the public, and those who serve them in a peculiar position. Last year I recall going to a restaurant where some of the menu items were labeled as “low cholesterol, heart healthy.” I told our server that [there is no evidence that dietary cholesterol](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/2015/02/why-you-should-no-longer-worry-about-cholesterol-in-food/) has any effect on serum levels in your body. But the overhang of nutritional orthodoxy persists, and the [American Heart Associations](http://www.heart.org/) prominence and tendency to be a lagging indictor of the science is going to cast a pall over “public awareness” for decades.

Now researchers are going back to the original studies which supported modern orthodoxy, and finding results that are surprising. [Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis: analysis of recovered data from Minnesota Coronary Experiment (1968-73)](http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i1246). Here is the conclusion:

> Available evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that > replacement of saturated fat in the diet with linoleic acid > effectively lowers serum cholesterol but does not support the > hypothesis that this translates to a lower risk of death from coronary > heart disease or all causes. Findings from the Minnesota Coronary > Experiment add to growing evidence that incomplete publication has > contributed to overestimation of the benefits of replacing saturated > fat with vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid.

The whole story is told over at [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/records-found-in-dusty-basement-undermine-decades-of-dietary-advice/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_HLTH_NEWS).
