Sex bias in migration from the steppe (revisited)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sexbias.png?resize=300%2C263)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sexbias.png?resize=300%2C263)](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/10/2657.abstract)Last fall I [blogged](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-sex-ratio-is-in-the-x/)a preprint which eventually came out as a paper in *PNAS*, [Ancient X chromosomes reveal contrasting sex bias in Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasian migrations](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/10/2657.abstract). The upshot is that the authors found that there was far less steppe ancestry on the X chromosomes of Bronze Age Central Europeans than across the whole genome. The natural inference here is that you had migrations of males into territory where they had to find local wives.

But the story does not end there. Iosif Lazaridis and David Reich have put out a short not on biorxiv, [Failure to Replicate a Genetic Signal for Sex Bias in the Steppe Migration into Central Europe](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/14/114124). It’s short, so I suggest you read the note yourself, but the major issue seems to be that on X chromosomes ADMIXTURE in supervised mode seems to behave really strangely. Lazaridis and Reich find that there seems to be a downward bias of steppe ancestry. Ergo, the finding was an artifact.

Goldberg et al. almost immediately responded, [Reply To Lazaridis And Reich: Robust Model-Based Inference Of Male-Biased Admixture During Bronze Age Migration From The Pontic-Caspian Steppe](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/03/122218). Their response seems to be that yes, ADMIXTURE does behave strangely, but the overall finding is still robust.

With these uncertainties I do wonder if it’s hard at this point to evaluate the alternative models. **But**, we do have archaeology and mtDNA. What do those say? On that basis, from what little I know, I am inclined to suspect a strong male bias of migration.
