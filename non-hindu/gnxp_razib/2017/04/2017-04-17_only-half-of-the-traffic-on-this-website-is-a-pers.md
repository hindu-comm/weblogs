Only half of the traffic on this website is from a personal ‘computer’

[![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/galaxy-s7-edge_gallery_left_gold_s3.png?resize=310%2C300)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/galaxy-s7-edge_gallery_left_gold_s3.png?resize=310%2C300)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CJU9BBM/geneexpressio-20)I spend way too much time semi-competently managing the VPS this site is hosted on. But at least now I can look at Google Analytics. I’ve found some interesting things.

For example, 35% of the traffic on this site comes from phones, and 10% from tablets. That means that conventional computers are only somewhat more than half of the views. Additionally, 50% more of the Facebook shares are via the mobile Facebook app than the normal desktop version (I tend to get the most referrals from Twitter since I have a bigger Twitter following, but at some point I expect Facebook to surpass that as people realize I’m blogging again).

Probably going to make a few changes to make the site more mobile friendly since so many of you tend to read it on that device….
