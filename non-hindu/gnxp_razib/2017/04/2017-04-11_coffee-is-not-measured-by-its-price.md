Coffee is not measured by its price

> Mr. Konecny’s ambitions for Yes Plz go beyond selling a high-quality > cup of coffee at that magic price point, though he knows that it sends > a powerful message. What he wants to do is shift the very nature of > coffee culture. He has no patience for what he calls the “culinary > burlesque” of pour-over bars, with their solemn baristas and potted > succulents. “It’s dress-up,” he said.  
> Those settings and presentations, he said, send the wrong message: > that **good coffee** must also be expensive and fetishized.

![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/coffee-calories.jpg?resize=150%2C100)![](https://i0.wp.com/gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/coffee-calories.jpg?resize=150%2C100)I drink a lot of coffee. At work I’m known to drink 40 or 60 ounces in a day. I also like specialty coffees, dating back to when I lived in Portland and patronized the [Stumptown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008J4WEBM/geneexpressio-20) on Belmont.

As someone who drinks black coffee I like the idea of a no frills establishment. But I also feel the piece’s opposition between cheap good coffee and expensive*faux*-good coffee is a bit much. In [How Pleasure Works](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393066320/geneexpressio-20) Paul Bloom elaborates on something that we know intuitively: **it is not always the sensory aspect of how something makes you feel, but also the intellectual aspect of what something is in a more contextual and broad sense.** I would pay a lot for legitimate [Falernian wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falernian_wine) without even knowing what it tastes like. To drink like Cicero would be enough.

Yes, sometimes you want the \$1 coffee. But sometimes you want the burlesque experience.
