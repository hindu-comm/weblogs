Human evolution & height?

In the [posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/10/hunter-gatherers-and-farmers-continuing.php) [below](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/10/lions-and-antelope.php) I wanted to make clear my assumption that [morbidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity) was likely more prevalent during the Neolithic than the Paleolithic. This does not mean of course that the Neolithic people were necessarily poorer than the Paleolithic peoples; Greg Cochran recently told me that people got *healthier* for obvious reasons during the Great Depression. I would not be surprised if the rate of mortality was somewhat higher than during the Paleolithic simply because the hunter-gatherer lifestyle had less buffering against disasters because trade and social networks were poorly developed so that environmental variation took a greater toll.

For me the biggest point to favor the idea of increased morbidity is that heights seem to have decreased after the Neolithic revolution. It seems plausible that nutritional shifts are the main reason that humans would shrink in size. Below the fold I have reproduced some charts from various papers for your reference.

The cite is [Long Bone Dimensions as an Index of Socioeconomic Change in Ancient Asian Populations](http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ejzy8882/docs/AAPA%202007%20Stature%20Handout.pdf). Of course, height is not the only thing that changed. From [Stature in Early Europeans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17003019):

Agricultural populations as a whole have shifted toward a less robust physique. The increase in height due to better nutrition doesn’t seem to have resulted in a more robusticity or a Palaeolithic dentition. So there may be some biological evolutionary parameters at work here as well. The first paper notes that **between region differences in height seem to persist** over long periods of time (East Asians are smaller). Phenomena such as [Bergmann’s rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%E2%80%99s_rule) point to changes in body form and size correlating with climatic shifts, and certainly the rise of agriculture is coincident with our current Interglacial.
