The fact of the irrational voter

Who are these people who believe that the public as a whole uses “deliberate, rational strategies”? Seems like this is the same stock-model that the press uses when they assert that “. The American people aren’t stupid.” **The American people are too stupid, and if you don’t think they are, you’re stupid yourself so you can’t judge.** Political scientists have long assumed that democracy is still a rational system because human stupidity doesn’t exhibit bias; in other words, the stupidity is randomly distributed so that intelligence shifts the majority decisively in the direction of the rational choice. Unfortunately, as Bryan Caplan argues in [The Myth of the Rational Voter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691138737/geneexpressio-20/), **humans do have systematic biases which overwhelm the rational signal in the irrational noise**. Anyone with a glancing familiarity with cognitive science would find Caplan’s hypothesis plausible on *a priori* grounds, but he marshals the empirical data. Intelligent people sometimes need a reminder that they can’t naively project their own mental operation to the modal human, just because someone is less irrational does not mean that they are necessarily less ignorant.

**Note:** Please be aware that you can substitute “people” for “American people.” I think the average human just not that bright.
