Steve Jones, in his own words

The BBC [interviews Steve Jones](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2008/10/081007_endofevolution.shtml). Nothing new. **I think Jones’ fixation on *natural* selection as a function of parameters exogenous to the population is part of the problem.** A lot of evolution is probably due to intraspecific dynamics, that is, individual vs. individual competition within a population, not to mention host-parasite co-evolution via the evolutionary arms race. And there is the ever present empirical contention that Jones’ makes that humans used to breed like [elephant seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_seal). He’s wrong. But, I have to say I understand why the media loves him, he exudes confidence and is not prone to the over subtly and qualification which is often the norm among academic scientists.  
**Related:** Britney & Jamie Lynn falsify Steve Jones, Evolution, why it still happens (in pictures) and No Virginia, evolution isn’t ending.
