I listened to the VP debate on the radio last night. Then afterwards I saw my RSS getting saturated with assessments. [The Corner](http://corner.nationalreview.com) reverberated with agreement that Sarah Palin wiped the floor with Joe Biden. Over at [Daily Kos](https://dailykos.com/) the assessment was curiously inverted. No surprise. But then listening to the NPR and seeing [Howard Fineman’s](http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/racetothefinish/archive/2008/10/03/palin-scored-points-but-she-didn-t-win.aspx) column show up my RSS I had to wonder: **who *cares* what these people think?** I mean, this is kind of like watching a basketball match, and then getting the sports reporters together 5 minutes after the game ends and having them decide who won! Why do we listen to or read these jokers? We know [who “won”](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/whats_a_win_vp_debate_edition.php); polls might only correlate to a modest degree with future electoral outcomes, or only imperfectly reflect the judgment of the people, **but they sure track public sentiment better than the “pundits.”**  
On a semi-related note, check out the site [Culture 11](http://culture11.com/). It’s a new outfit which is stocked mostly with Rightish young intellectuals who don’t seem to be [Party-Men](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009A2OKA/geneexpressio-20/). Now, some of you might shudder at the thought of reading the scribblings of the Right-leaning…but you’re doing that right now!
