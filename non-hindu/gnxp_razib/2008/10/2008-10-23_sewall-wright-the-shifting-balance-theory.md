Sewall Wright & the Shifting Balance Theory

David’s penultimate post on Sewall Wright, [Notes on Sewall Wright: The Shifting Balance Theory – Part 1](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/10/notes-on-sewall-wright-shifting-balance.php):

> Two catch-phrases indissolubly linked with Sewall Wright are the > adaptive landscape, and the shifting balance. In preparing my note on > Wright’s concept of the adaptive landscape I was surprised to discover > that Wright himself seldom if ever used this expression. I could not > find a single example. I was therefore half-expecting that I would not > find any reference to the shifting balance either – and I would have > been half-right. Wright did use that term, but not, as far as I can > find, until surprisingly late in his long career….

Part 2 coming soon….
