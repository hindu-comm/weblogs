Portfolio rollback

[Condé Nast Cuts Focus on 2 Magazines](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/business/media/31mag.html?hp):

> Through the first nine months of the year, ad pages in all United > States magazines were down 9.5 percent from the same period in 2007. Most magazines produced by Condé Nast – including Vogue, GQ, Architectural Digest and Wired – have had much smaller declines, **but they are also among the most expensive magazines to produce.** >
> Portfolio, started last year amid much fanfare, is Condé Nast’s first business magazine and its most expensive new project in years. Executives said the company was willing to lose more than \$100 million on it.

I immediately thought of this, [Can Si Newhouse Keep Condé Nast’s Gloss Going?](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/business/media/20si.html?_r=1&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/N/New%20Yorker,%20The&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin):

> Some extravagances have been curtailed, but no one in the business > disputes that Condé still spends far more money than its competitors. Magazine publishers and editors in chief haul in \$400,000 to \$2 million in salary and bonuses, current and former executives say, and many executives have clothing allowances in the high five figures. >
> … >
> Last July, Vanity Fair printed 20 different versions of its cover, a > daisy chain of celebrity pairs shot over many months and on multiple continents by Ms. Leibovitz, a project that cost millions. It paid for itself, says the magazineâ€™s editor, Mr. Carter, in increased newsstand sales and buzz. >
> Mr. Phillips, the investment banker, observed, “I would say if you > look across their whole portfolio, Condé Nast does a better job of producing high-quality magazines than anybody else in the industry.” But, he adds, **“you really could spend a lot less money on those magazines without affecting quality.”**

I remember thinking at the time that when the bubble bursts they’ll regret not running a more efficient operation. To some extent it seems like Advance treats its glossies like performance art as opposed to a business operation. Of course, S. I. Newhouse is [nearly a 10 billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Irving_Newhouse,_Jr.) so I guess he can afford to be less orthodox than the typical billion-pinching mogul. At least [The Big Money](http://www.thebigmoney.com/) isn’t going anywhere.
