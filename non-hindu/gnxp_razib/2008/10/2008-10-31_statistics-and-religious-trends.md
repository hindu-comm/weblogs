Statistics and religious trends

I have a piece up for *The Guardian’s* new [Comment is Free Belief](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief) site, [The use and abuse of statistics – Prophecies of the extinction of religion, or its triumph, fall prey to the weaknesses of linear prediction](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2008/oct/31/atheism-statistics-religion). Implicit in my argument are [these sorts of dynamics](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/abstinence-pled.html):

> Bearman and Brückner have also identified a peculiar dilemma: in some > schools, if too many teens pledge, the effort basically collapses. **Pledgers apparently gather strength from the sense that they are an embattled minority**; once their numbers exceed thirty per cent, and proclaimed chastity becomes the norm, that special identity is lost….

This is in regards to virginity, but the insight is generalizable. You don’t have to know anything about [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) though, just read a cultural history of France since the Revolution and you’ll see what I mean.
