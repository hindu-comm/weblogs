Genes which predict baldness?

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/PH2008100601285-719029.jpg)[Male-pattern baldness susceptibility locus at 20p11](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.255.html):

> We conducted a genome-wide association study for androgenic alopecia > in 1,125 men and identified a newly associated locus at chromosome > 20p11.22, confirmed in three independent cohorts (n = 1,650; OR = > 1.60, P = 1.1 10-14 for rs1160312).

*ScienceDaily* has a somewhat amusing headline, [Baldness Gene Discovered: 1 In 7 Men At Risk](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081012164437.htm):

Well, the [SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=1160312) at 20p11 exhibits different frequencies of the alleles across the HapMap populations (Europeans are the outgroup to Africans and Asians, just as they are to a great extent on the phenotype). I was amused at the use of the term “risk,” I understand the technical reason, but it seems to make male pattern baldness seems like a much more problematic condition than it really is.  
Update: [Genetic Future](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/10/male_pattern_baldness_enters_t.php) has a [much more thorough post](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/10/male_pattern_baldness_enters_t.php).
