*Wired* has a [story](http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/10/personal-pod--1.html) about pod cars! Awesome. Pod cars are one of those things ubiquitous in science fiction (like humanoid robots) that just never come to be. In contrast, computer technology has advanced so far in the past generation that older science fiction resembles some sort of alternative history where Apple didn’t transform home computing more than extrapolation from the present.  
Granted, I don’t have much of an opinion on the feasibility of pod cars. Nor do I really care. It just would be fun to have a little bit of *Logan’s Run* around (mind you, just a *little bit*).
