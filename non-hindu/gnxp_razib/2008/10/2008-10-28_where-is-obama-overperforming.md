Where is Obama overperforming?

There has been a lot of talk of Barack Obama “expanding the map” this cycle for the Democrats. In mid-September when John McCain was at his polling-peak many were assuming that had just been a pipe-dream, and that the traditional Democratic strategy of winning big blue states was back in play. But with the Obama bounce not so fast! So where is Obama exactly expanding he map? Below is a map generated by [Andrew Gelman](http://redbluerichpoor.com/blog/?p=165) comparing Kerry’s 2004 election results with current averaged poll numbers.
