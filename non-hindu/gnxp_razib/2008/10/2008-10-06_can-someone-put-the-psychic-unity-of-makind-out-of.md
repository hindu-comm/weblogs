Can someone put the psychic unity of makind out of its misery?

[Evolutionary emergence of responsive and unresponsive personalities](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/10/03/0805473105.short?rss=1):

> In many animal species, individuals differ consistently in suites of > correlated behaviors, comparable with human personalities. Increasing > evidence suggests that one of the fundamental factors structuring > personality differences is the responsiveness of individuals to > environmental stimuli. Whereas some individuals tend to be highly > responsive to such stimuli, others are unresponsive and show > routine-like behaviors. Much research has focused on the proximate > causes of these differences but little is known about their > evolutionary origin. Here, we provide an evolutionary explanation. We > develop a simple but general evolutionary model that is based on two > key ingredients. **First, the benefits of responsiveness are > frequency-dependent; that is, being responsive is advantageous when > rare but disadvantageous when common.** This explains why responsive > and unresponsive individuals can coexist within a population. > **Second, positive-feedback mechanisms reduce the costs of > responsiveness; that is, responsiveness is less costly for individuals > that have been responsive before.** This explains why individuals > differ consistently in their responsiveness, across contexts and over > time. As a result, natural selection gives rise to stable individual > differences in responsiveness. Whereas some individuals respond to > environmental stimuli in all kinds of contexts, others consistently > neglect such stimuli. Interestingly, such differences induce > correlations among all kinds of other traits (e.g., boldness and > aggressiveness), thus providing an explanation for > environment-specific behavioral syndromes.
