DonorsChoose 2008

It’s fall 2008, and I’m starting the 3rd DonorsChoose drive in this weblog’s history. In 2006 \$1,941.06 was given through this weblog’s challenges. In 2007 \$4,354.19. **First, thank you to everyone who donated!** Second, the priority is obviously to give money where needed, but, it would be nice to keep the trend [monotonic](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monotonic) as long as possible, if you know what I mean! There are two types of proposals in my list this year: having to do with biology, or from schools which are in disproportionate need. More updates later in the month….
