Elites more firm in their opinions (just)….

In response to my post below, Are the elites more polarized? Yes!, a comment:

This seems plausible. How to figure this out? First, one thing to remember is that there is a correlation between measures of intelligence/knowledge and socioeconomic status. Here is number correct on the vocab test out of 10 on the Y axis and socioeconomic index divided into quartiles on the X (WORDSUM and SEI):

The correlation between SEI (which is on a 17-98 scale) and WORDSUM is 0.37. In terms of “low information,” one has to take into account general levels of education and/or intelligence.  
At this point I wanted to query all the variables which ask people how “firm” they are in their views. Unfortunately, the vast majority have very low N’s. Additionally, none of these included socioeconomic information. There is one question though, ABFIRM, which asks about abortion, with a decent sample size (2,430 whites answered this question). Since this is the exemplar of Culture War issues, I decided to look at it for education and vocab test.

It looks to me that the low proportion who seem very changeable in their viewpoint on this touchstone cultural issue are those with less education, or lower vocabulary test scores (note that I lumped everyone who scored from 0 to 2 together since the N’s here were low). So there does seem to be some suggestion here of polarization and certitude as one moves up the socioeconomic ladder in terms of an issue which is often portrayed as a black & white divide. Unfortunately, it’s just one variable, and the effect is weak enough that I would want to look at others (obviously, the overwhelming number of people are rather set in their ways when it comes to their position on abortion; at least at any given time). But as I said the N’s for other issues I could think of were just really small. If people can think of a way to use the GSS to expand beyond this issue, or have other data besides the GSS, I will post an update….
