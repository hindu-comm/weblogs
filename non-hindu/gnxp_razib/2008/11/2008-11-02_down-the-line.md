Down the line

My discussion with [Jim Manzi](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/10/30/still-on-strike-against-campaign-blogging-why-its-plausible-that-epistatic-interactions-are-complex) on [epistasis](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/through-rugged-roads-of-gene-land.php) generated a lot commentary. It’s a complex topic, as I said there are different ways to define epistasis, and evolutionarily its effect on trait value might be different from its effect on fitness. Finally, I think it is important that epistatic and additive genetic variation can convert from one to the other; and over the long term it is this heritable variation which is the “stuff of evolution,” so to speak. But a friend recommended that I post a figure from [Genome-wide association analysis identifies 20 loci that influence adult height](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v40/n5/abs/ng.121.html).

One figure does not an argument make, but the cumulative impact of these data will resolve to some extent disputes about the efficacy of interaction effects. **I say to some extent** because evolutionary biology is predicated on variation, and I will not be surprised if one finds it difficult to fruitfully generalize about the ubiquity of particular processes across the whole of deep time & the tree of life.
