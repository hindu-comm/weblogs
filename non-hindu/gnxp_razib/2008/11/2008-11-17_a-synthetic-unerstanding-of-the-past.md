A synthetic unerstanding of the past

[Ancient DNA, Strontium isotopes, and osteological analyses shed light on social and kinship organization of the Later Stone Age](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/11/17/0807592105.short?rss=1):

> In 2005 four outstanding multiple burials were discovered near Eulau, > Germany. The 4,600-year-old graves contained groups of adults and > children buried facing each other. Skeletal and artifactual evidence > and the simultaneous interment of the individuals suggest the supposed > families fell victim to a violent event. In a multidisciplinary > approach, archaeological, anthropological, geochemical (radiogenic > isotopes), and molecular genetic (ancient DNA) methods were applied to > these unique burials. Using autosomal, mitochondrial, and > Y-chromosomal markers, we identified genetic kinship among the > individuals. A direct child-parent relationship was detected in one > burial, providing the oldest molecular genetic evidence of a nuclear > family. Strontium isotope analyses point to different origins for > males and children versus females. **By this approach, we gain insight into a Late Stone Age society, which appears to have been exogamous and patrilocal, and in which genetic kinship seems to be a focal point of social organization.**
