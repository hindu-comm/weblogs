The Great White Sort

I suggested below that though [on average](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/the_rise_of_the_non_whites.php) whites did not move toward the Democrats, regionally there might be differences. I inferred this from the fact that areas where blacks are thin on the ground in the South it looks as if John McCain did better than George W. Bush in 2004. So I compared the voting patterns of whites in the [2008](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p1) and [2004](https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5297138) elections; and there are regional differences.

  
**2008 Democratic presidential white vote declined 15% or more vs. 2004**  
**2008 Democratic presidential white vote increased 15% or more vs. 2004**
