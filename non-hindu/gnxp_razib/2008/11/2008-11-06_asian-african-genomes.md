Asian & African genomes….

Yes. This weblog is ostensibly about genetics. And yes, I’ve gotten a little obsessed about crunching election data. Honestly, I get a little bit like this every four years…I remember the ’96 election and the primitive years of the internet even. I decided I might as well post on my fixation for a few days to get it out of my system. Be aware that you won’t have to deal with any normative political arguments from me; I don’t care enough about *ought*, or, more accurately I don’t think you are really interested in my opinions about the Good Life and how to obtain it.  
In any case, since Dan MacArthur is a subject of a monarch, he isn’t blogging about republican politics. So make sure to check out this [thorough post](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/african_and_asian_genome_seque.php) on the publishing of [Asian & African genomes](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/african_and_asian_genome_seque.php).
