George R. R. Martin on science fiction

This week’s *To The Best Of Our Knowledge* [interviews George R. R. Martin](http://www.wpr.org/BOOK/081123a.cfm). If you have iTunes just subscribe to their podcast and you’ll see it on the list of shows (I don’t know where to find it streaming online). I was talking to an owner of a local science fiction bookstore, and we agreed that many angry fans are going to break down the gates of hell and tear him to pieces if Martin [does a Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan#Illness). Apropos of which the proprietor mused how worrying it was that the 60 year old Martin is corpulent (also, he resented the fact that Martin took vacations!). On the other hand, we agreed that there’s no way [Brandon Sanderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson) would ever be commissioned to complete [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire).
