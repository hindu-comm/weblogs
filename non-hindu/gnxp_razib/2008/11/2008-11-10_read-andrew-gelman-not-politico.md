Read Andrew Gelman, not Politico

[Politico](http://www.politico.com/) is the pleasure of the pundit-class. That being said, [Andrew Gelman’s](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/11/the_myth_of_poo.html) site makes it rather clear that [Politico](http://www.politico.com/) is also *US Weekly* for politicians. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but their fixation on epiphenomenal froth should really have “for entertainment purposes only” disclaimer. I’m picking on [Politico](http://www.politico.com/) because I don’t want to crucify Howard Fineman again lest the dead shall rise to rebuke my abuse.

  
This post is prompted by Andrew’s post, [A Democratic swing, not an Obama swing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/11/the_myth_of_poo.html):

Young pundits of diverse dispositions such as [Will Wilkinson](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/), [Matt Continetti](http://www.weeklystandard.com/AboutUs/bio_continetti.asp) and [Matt Yglesias](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/) are already brandishing data from Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State. I believe that the new pundit class is naturally cognizant of the creative destruction wrought by the world wide web upon the marketplace of vacuous opining. It is simply trivially easy for anonymous individuals across the web to to produce a full-court saturation of Finemanesque stupidity which drives the per unit cost of drivel to \$0.00. [For example](http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/10/21/gallup-and-new-coke.php), a virtuosity of stupidity from D J Drummond:

> The polls are wrong this year, very wrong. I have been saying this for > months, and I have backed up my claim with both statistical and > anecdotal support. The claims I have made have inspired some, caused > others to laugh in derision, and brought others to test their > assumptions and revisit the hard data.

Well, I am not a big believer in > conspiracies, but I do think that the polling groups have fallen into > a groupthink condition….

This is the tip of the iceberg as a [colossus](http://wizbangblog.com/content/2008/11/03/turners.php) of hackery takes shape; an army of dunces is on the horizon. With the arrival of these legions capable of producing boneheaded punditry to satisfy the micro-targeted need for “conventional wisdom” among the mostly dull masses, there is going to be a market for those who can translate data & statistics into prose for individuals with a more discerning analytic palette. Next stop: [Bayes Theorem](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes).
