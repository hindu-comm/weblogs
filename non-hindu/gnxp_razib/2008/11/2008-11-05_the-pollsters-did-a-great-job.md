The Pollsters Did a Great Job

- Not a single state was predicted incorrectly by pollster.com’s final
  map. The average [error in predicting the state
  margins](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/actual_vote_margin_by_preelect.php)
  between the candidates was less than .5%. - The [popular
  vote](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/president/) is not
  completely in yet, but it seems to be conforming to [pollster’s
  predictions](http://www.pollster.com/polls/us/08-us-pres-ge-mvo.php). - For now on when someone makes an argument devoid of facts or logic I
  shall refer to them as a “[DJ
  Drummond](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/10/polls-are-smarter-than-you.php)”
  instead of a retard.
