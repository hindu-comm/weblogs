Sewall Wright & the Shifting Balance Theory (part II)

[Notes on Sewall Wright: The Shifting Balance Theory (Part 2)](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/notes-on-sewall-wright-shifting-balance.php):

> Part 1 of this note dealt with Sewall Wrightâ€™s Shifting Balance theory > of evolution (the SBT) in its original form, as propounded between > 1929 and 1931. This final part deals with subsequent developments in > the theory. These include refinements and elaborations, some changes > of emphasis, one major addition, and one major change of substance. In > particular I will cover:  
> 1. The role of new mutations  
> 2. The concept of selective peaks  
> 3. The effect of changes in environment  
> 4. The adaptiveness of evolution  
> 5. The process of intergroup selection  
> 6. The three phases of the shifting balance.  
> I will throw in a few remarks about Fisher and Haldane as well.
