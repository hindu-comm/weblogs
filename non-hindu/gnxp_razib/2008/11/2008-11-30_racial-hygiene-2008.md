Racial hygiene 2008?

[FuturePundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/005748.html) points me to a research paper, [Impact of a new national screening policy for Down’s syndrome in Denmark: population based cohort study](//www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/nov27_2/a2547):

> **Results** The number of infants born with Down’s syndrome decreased > from 55-65 per year during 2000-4 to 31 in 2005 and 32 in 2006. The > total number of chorionic villus samplings and amniocenteses carried > out decreased from 7524 in 2000 to 3510 in 2006. The detection rate in the screened population in 2005 was 86% (95% confidence interval 79% to 92%) and in 2006 was 93% (87% to 97%). The corresponding false positive rates were 3.9% (3.7% to 4.1%) and 3.3% (3.1% to 3.4%).  
> **Conclusion** The introduction of a combined risk assessment during > the first trimester at a national level in Denmark halved the number > of infants born with Down’s syndrome. The strategy also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of chorionic villus samplings and amniocenteses carried out, even before full implementation of the policy.
