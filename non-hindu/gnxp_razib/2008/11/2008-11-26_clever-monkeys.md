Clever Monkeys

I thought I knew a fair amount about monkeys already, but a BBC wildlife documentary last night still had some surprises for me. The documentary is ouststanding even by the BBCâ€™s usual standards for this kind of thing. I dare say it will be broadcast in most countries sooner or later, but meanwhile it can be seen online [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00ft5nv/Natural_World_Cheeky_Monkey/) (iplayer or equivalent required).
