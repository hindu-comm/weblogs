New theory of MHC diversity?

[A new theory of MHC evolution: beyond selection on the immune genes](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/m166p1048427p5v3/):

> The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a dense region of immune > genes with high levels of polymorphism, which are arranged in > haplotype blocks. Traditional models of balancing selection (i.e. > overdominance and negative frequency dependence) were developed to > study the population genetics of single genes. However, the MHC is a > multigene family surrounded by linked (non-neutral) polymorphisms, and > not all of its features are well explained by these models. For > example, (i) the high levels of polymorphism in small populations, > (ii) the unexpectedly large genetic differentiation between > populations, (iii) the shape of the allelic genealogy associated with > trans-species evolution, and (iv) the close associations between > particular MHC (human leucocyte antigen, HLA) haplotypes and the > approximately 100 pathologies in humans. **Here, I propose a new model > of MHC evolution named Associative Balancing Complex evolution that > can explain these phenomena.** The model proposes that recessive > deleterious mutations accumulate as a ‘sheltered load’ nearby MHC > genes. These mutations can accumulate because (i) they are rarely > expressed as homozygotes given the high MHC gene diversity and (ii) > purifying selection is inefficient with low recombination rates (cf. Muller’s ratchet). Once fixed, these mutations add to balancing selection and further reinforce linkage through epistatic selection against recombinants.
