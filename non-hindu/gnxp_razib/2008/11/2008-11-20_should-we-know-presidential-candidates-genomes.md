Should we know presidential candidates’ genomes?

That’s the question being asked at [The Personal Genome](http://thepersonalgenome.com/2008/11/presidential-dna-dont-ask-dont-tel/). Over at [Genetic Future](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/11/embryo_screening_for_common_di.php) Dan “The Man” MacArthur notes the difficulties which might emerge if we start engaging in widespread embryo screening. So how exactly is the average American voter going to interpret the myriad of genes responsible for only a [small fraction](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/how-predictive-are-known-genetic.php) of phenotypic variation?  
I’m not sure that genetic data adds much value for the body politic. **I would want to know,** but, I would also take SAT scores and college transcripts before I’d be interested in a candidate’s genetic sequence. Our president elect has not, for example, [released his academic record.](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_were_Barack_Obama's_grades_in_college)
