Why does the genetic map of Europe still work?

An interesting point. Some levels of immigration and movement have always been part of European history. Think about the [outflow of Huguenots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot#Edict_of_Fontainebleau) after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The trade and migration between the Low Countries and the eastern shore of Britain. The immigration of Spaniards, Poles and Italians to France in the 19th century. The relocation of Saxons to Romania, Russia, etc.

Some thoughts:

1\) Many of the immigrants, like the Huguenots, settled disproportionately in cities and towns (the Volga Russians are an exception obviously). French in Berlin, British Puritans in Amsterdam, Jewish industrial workers in East London, Asian sailors in Cardiff. And cities until recently were powerful relative population sinks. So modern European cities might be affected by past immigration (e.g., in changing the accent on dialects) culturally, but they are far less reshaped genetically than you would expect.

2\) Many of the immigrants were from nearby regions. Spanish and Italian immigration to France was far higher than Polish. So the affect would be more to subtly shift the positions and centers of gravity, as opposed to rearranged the expected spatial relationship.

3\) Aside from France, there wasn’t much migration as a proportion of the population. The ancestors from Aberswyth and Krakow are very salient because of their exoticism. This is just subject to the same dynamics as [disappearing English phenomenon](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/where-have-all-engish-americans-gone.php).

4\) They sampled from only a few locations within each nation, so the clumping is exaggerated, and combined with \#3, the migration effect wasn’t strong enough to change your impression. Perhaps they also generally don’t sample ethnic minorities in these studies; e.g., avoiding Hungarians and Saxons in Romania.

5\) Some migrations, like the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe after World War II, rolled back the obscuring effects of earlier movements.

I was thinking about following the notes and what not and see where the samples came from, but I’ll leave it to enterprising readers. I’m sure that can answer some of these questions.
