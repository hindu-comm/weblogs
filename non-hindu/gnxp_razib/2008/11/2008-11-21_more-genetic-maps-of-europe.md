More genetic maps of Europe

Another paper on European phyogeography, [Investigation of the fine structure of European populations with applications to disease association studies](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v16/n12/abs/ejhg2008210a.html):

> An investigation into fine-scale European population structure was > carried out using high-density genetic variation on nearly 6000 > individuals originating from across Europe. The individuals were > collected as control samples and were genotyped with more than 300 000 > SNPs in genome-wide association studies using the Illumina Infinium > platform.

Below the fold is a PC map where I’ve added clarifying labels.

But there’s another fascinating map which I think needs to be highlighted.

As you can see, **there is population substructure within Germany.** We need to map these things out ***now*** before the EU mobility wipes clear many of the historical information signals. These data will be a great boon to historians trying to understand the patterns of ethnogenesis in pre-modern Europe. There are textual support for the contention that the medieval German drive to the east resulted in the Germanization of many West Slavic peoples, these sorts of data can test these hypotheses.  
Finally, I’ll leave you with this comment from [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/11/european-population-structure-with-300k.html):

If you read the paper you can see that the differences between European nationalities are very small, especially in a worldwide context. But that does not mean that they are trivial when it comes to giving us information about population structure.
