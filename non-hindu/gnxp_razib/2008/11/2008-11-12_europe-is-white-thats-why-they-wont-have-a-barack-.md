Europe is white, that’s why they won’t have a Barack Obama soon

*The New York Times* has a piece up, [After Breakthrough, Europe Looks in Mirror](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/world/europe/12europe.html?hp=&pagewanted=print), which quotes people who wonder when Europe will have its own colored head of state. Let’s ignore for a moment that the [longest serving Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jenkinson,_2nd_Earl_of_Liverpool) in British history was 1/8 Indian; that was nearly 200 years ago and despite his known and acknowledged colored heritage Lord Liverpool was first and foremost a scion of the British nobility. These sorts of self-flagellations make no sense. **The United States is about 30% non-white** (many Hispanics identify as racially white, but operationally the Hispanic/Latino category is considered non-white). If Europe looks in the mirror, [it sees a white person](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Cheryl_X_FACTOR.jpg)!

  
The 70% which is “white” in the United States includes a few percent of Middle Eastern Americans who would be considered colored in Europe (Ralph Nader is not considered colored in the United States, so I don’t grant that Arabs are always considered to be non-white, it depends). So it is probably fair to say that on the order of 2 out of 3 Americans are of European white ancestry. A substantial majority, but still way less white than any European country. Additionally, non-whites have been a substantial proportion of the American population from its founding, when blacks were 20-25% of the population. The proportion declined as European immigration increased until the United States was a 90% white nation by the 1950s. I think most Americans will agree that the 1950s were the apotheosis of “white America” (even if the high tide of white supremacy was receding). Guess how white the United Kingdom is today? [92% white!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingom#Ethnic_groups). Yes, Britain today is whiter than the United States was during the 1950s. Even London is still majority white. Yes, London is [68% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London#Ethnic_groups). Washington D.C. is [38% non-Hispanic white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_D.C.#Demographics). New York City, [35%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City#Racial_and_Ethnic_composition). Chicago, [31% non-Hispanic white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago#Demographics). Even [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Seattle) is darker than London! Yeah, you read that right, **Seattle is more colored than London.**  
The rest of Europe isn’t any more colorful. Quick back of the envelope suggests that Italy is [more than 95% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy#Demographics). Spain, more than [95% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Spain#Immigration_and_Demographic_Issues). Sweden, well over [90% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Sweden#Ethnicity). Germany, around [90% white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany#Demographics) (I am being very generous here with high estimates, but it is likely that well over 50% of the 19% non-Germany population in Germany are from EU or Balkan nations; ergo, white). France is a tough cookie because they don’t like to collect ethnic data since all their ancestors are Gauls on *a priori* grounds. But, high bound estimates of Muslims suggest that around 10% of the population is of North African or West African origin which is Muslim. Add on top of that another 5% which is non-Muslim African, Vietnamese, etc., I think it is plausible to believe conservatively that France is still at least 85% white, making it the most colored country in Europe! The most colored nation in Europe is probably as white as the American state of [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio#Demographics).  
I am being very explicit here because I suspect that though most people know these statistics vaguely, **they’ve been brainwashed into pretending as their are swarms of colored people all across Europe who needed to be “included”.** I’m specifically thinking about criticisms of the [Up!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_series) series in Britain for example which follows about a dozen individuals over their lifetime. Some have criticized it for being too white and only including one token non-white in the cast. But look, 1 out of 12 is representative today! The series started in the 1960s when there were far fewer non-whites around. But the press has its script, an apparently for a television show to “look like Britain” it really has to look like London.  
The perception that coloreds are swarming the land in Europe is surely due in part to their concentration in urban areas, which far exceeds anything the United States. After all, there is a large reservoir of rural blacks and Latinos who have been heavily involved in the American agricultural sector. In Europe this does not exist, the peasantry is totally white. I also think that the rate of change matters a great deal, **America has gone from 1/10th non-white to 1/3rd non-white in 2 generations.** Europe has gone from on the order of 0% non-white to 5% non-white within 2 generations. That’s just an incredible rate of increase, no wonder people think that the coloreds are coming!  
This is not to deny the reality of racism, institutional barriers and lack of assimilation in Europe. But let’s just grow up and not be so simple-minded. I’ve had relatives, friends and acquaintances who’ve lived in the USA and Europe as colored (in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, etc.). It’s hard to generalize, but on the whole most people experienced less explicit racism in the USA than they did in those countries (everyone lived in “cosmopolitan” urban areas from what I know, so it can’t be that they live in New York in the USA and rural Germany in Europe). The United States has a long history of colored citizens, even if they were second-class citizens for most of American history. Europe has not. Yes, there were isolated cases of prominent individuals with non-white ancestry, such as [Alexander Dumas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_père), but the non-white communities, such as sailors in Cardiff, were quickly absorbed and disappeared into the memory hole. Many white Americans are discomfited with the idea of a black man as head of state, but, they would not deny that a black man is an American (granted, Obama-the-Muslim-Arab is a special case, but then we have to crank down the significance of the *sui generis* exotic-black-man winning the presidency). Until the past decade Germany had a very robust legal framework of “blood” citizenship which dated back to the late 19th century. *Volkisch* indeed. It was therefore common for Volga Germans who barely spoke German and whose ancestors had lived in Russia for 200 years to be given German citizenship, while the children of Turkish guest workers born and raised in Germany were Turkish, and not German, citizens.  
As the second half of the 20th century began most European nations did not conceive of themselves as destinations for immigrants (the main exception being France). But the reality was always more complex; Britain long had immigrants from Ireland, which was operationally a separate nation even though it was not politically independent until the early 20th century. Berlin was a strongly Huguenot city in the 18th century. Small communities of industrious artisans from the Low Countries were wooed by many European monarchs in the early modern period, only to disappear into the general population after a few generations. But aside from France these migrations were of relatively minimal scope (Berlin might have been 25% French speaking, but Prussia had proportionately far fewer Huguenots). Additionally, the cultural distance between Protestant Dutch miners and Protestant Swedish farmers was lower than between Oriental Orthodox Assyrians and post-Protestant Swedes. The past may tell us about the present, but it is no perfect model for the now. French Huguenots might have had a sense of superiority in regards to their culture and wished to maintain their traditions, but after their expulsion from Catholic France there was no turning back. This is not analogous in to a Turkish German who has dual citizenship, takes holidays in Turkey every winter and marries someone from Turkey. Black Americans, who were long denied voting rights, are a relatively well mobilized group and politically focused. In contrast, American Latinos and Asians are far less engaged. Does this surprise one when one notes the multinational and immigrant character of these groups? Black Americans have no choice about which nation they identify with, despite some romanticism for Africa, the United States is the only nation they have, and will have. This is not so for more recent immigrant groups.  
I only feel like I have to post about this because I’ve read and heard way too much sentimentality about what the election of Barack Obama “means” for Europe, and colored people living in Europe. It seems now that all things being equal Europeans are more prejudiced, and Americans less so, no? **But all things are not equal!** Yes, I actually do think that white Europeans are probably more prejudiced than white Americans, several European nations have given more than 15% of their vote to white nationalist parties (Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, etc.). I also think many colored Europeans have bad attitudes and I wish European countries would get serious about bribing more of the crazy Muslims to go live in crazy Muslim countries and get their primitive on there instead of ruining Europe with their daughter-killing & ninja dressing. But it’s complicated. America elected a black man as president when even three generations ago there was some debate on whether non-whites should be granted citizenship (naturalization being limited to whites). That’s enough to talk about instead of making stretched analogies and debasing the complexities of reality.  
**P.S.:** Remember that Obama only won 43% of the white vote. Not that there’s anything wrong with that!
