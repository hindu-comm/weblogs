No temperance

This article, [Some See Big Problem in Wisconsin Drinking](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/us/16wisconsin.html?hp=&pagewanted=print), speaks to some of John Emerson’s [comments below](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/different-american-conservatisms.php). This made me laugh:

> Most people in Wisconsin say the beer-drinking traditions reflect the > customs of German immigrants, passed down generations. More than 40 > percent of Wisconsin residents can trace their ancestry to Germany. > **Some experts, though, are skeptical of the ethnic explanation. It > has been a very long time, after all, since German was spoken in the > beer halls of Wisconsin.**

Look, these people might not speak German, but they still [eat raw meat](http://www.madison.com/wsj/mad/top/index.php?ntid=263367) (not that there’s anything wrong with that!). And Norwegian Americans might not speak Norwegian, but they still eat [Lutefisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutefisk). It is notable that the piece does not quote by name any of those “experts.” I wonder if the author just didn’t want to make an ethnic generalization in relation to the origins of drunkenness, and so just inserted the stock “don’t generalize!” admonition in there….
