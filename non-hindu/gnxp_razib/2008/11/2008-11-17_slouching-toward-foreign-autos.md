Slouching toward foreign autos….

Here is a chart from [Jim Manzi](http://theamericanscene.com/2008/11/17/detroit-same-old-same-old):

I added a trendline of GDP growth in the United States from 1995-2006 to suggest the general economic climate. As they usually don’t say: **the fundamentals are *not* strong.** Matt Yglesias [makes a pointed](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/analogies_7.php), if admittedly somewhat unfair, analogy:

This seems right. Many people, even those who aren’t politicians with interest groups to satisfy, and elections to win, feel that we need to **do something.** But sometimes it is just important to do no harm. Unlike the Iraq war we’re not trashing labor and capital on a fool’s errand. But a “soft landing” toward the inevitable extinction for the American auto-industry means fewer resources for the rest of the economy.
