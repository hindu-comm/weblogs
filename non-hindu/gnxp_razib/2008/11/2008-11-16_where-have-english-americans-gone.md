Where have English Americans gone?

Elsewhere, I reiterate the common sense case that the [decline in the proportion of Americans who are of “English” ancestry](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/11/where-have-all-engish-americans-gone.php) over the past 30 years from 22% to 9% is mostly a function of changed questionnaires and cultural preferences.
