Fat attitude

[In the Fatosphere, Big Is in, or at Least Accepted](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/health/22fblogs.html):

> Blogs written by fat people — and it’s fine to use the word, they say > — have multiplied in recent months, filling a virtual soapbox known as the fatosphere, where bloggers calling for fat acceptance challenge just about everything conventional medical wisdom has to say about obesity.  
> …  
> Ultimately, these bloggers argue, being skinny **may have far more to do with the luck of the genetic draw than with lifestyle choices.**

When I was visiting Bangladesh in 2004 I noticed that peasants in the rural areas were shorter, wirier and “tighter” in their physique than many people in Dhaka. Though Dhaka residents weren’t tall, they did strike me as taller, and a substantial subset were endowed with a plump visage which one rarely saw among rural peasants. Dhaka is a mega-city which has grown by orders of magnitude over the past few generations. In other words, very few people living there are natives for whom Dhaka is an ancestral home; over 9/10^(th) are 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants.
