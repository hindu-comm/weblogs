The most ‘intelligent’ species on the planet….

[Big Weddings Bring Afghans Joy, and Debt](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/world/asia/14weddings.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all):

> In Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, bridegrooms > are expected to pay not only for their weddings, but also all the > related expenses, including several huge prewedding parties and money > for the bride’s family, a kind of reverse dowry.

[Bill Cosby may be right about African-Americans spending a lot on expensive sneakers–but he’s wrong about why](http://www.slate.com/toolbar.aspx?action=print&id=2181822):

These are the sorts of data which has resulted in my turn away from principled libertarianism; in my opinion political ideology should be grounded in the art of the possible not the yearning for what should be. The more we delve into ‘human nature’ the more complex and bewildering it becomes, and the less our naive reliance on the powers of human agency seems to be a wise course.  
**Note:** I have read ethnographic literature from Southeast Asian which suggests that some communities have converted to world religions (in this case Islam and Christianity) to escape the onerous expectations of the community in regards to ritual feasts and other various customary outlays. Since these expenses are justified on religious grounds a rejection of the tribal religion is a principled “opt-out,” and an integration into a universalist religion results in compensation for the social ostracism which might be incurred by the removal of oneself from the communal activities which have sacral import. That being said, **I suspect this sort of behavior has only an epiphenomenal significance, because over time whole communities tend to convert to world religions.** At that point the old dynamics no doubt reassert themselves as communal outlays are now justified as part of the customary tithe or zakat for the new dispensation.
