Jamie Lynn Spears: uncertain paternity?

![Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg?resize=180%2C435)![Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg?resize=180%2C435)Turns out that Jamie Lynn Spears’ [baby daddy is expressing paternity skepticism](http://thesuperficial.com/2008/01/casey_aldridge_dumps_jamie_lyn.php). He might check out the paper [How Well Does Paternity Confidence Match Actual Paternity? Evidence from Worldwide Nonpaternity Rates](http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/A/Kermyt.G.Anderson-1/papers/worldwidepc.pdf):

> This survey of published estimates of nonpaternity suggests that for > men with high paternity confidence, nonpaternity rates are typically > 1.7% (if we exclude studies of unknown methodology) to 3.3% (if we > include such studies). These figures are substantially lower than the “typical” nonpaternity rate of 10% or higher cited by many researchers, often without substantiation…or the median worldwide nonpaternity rate of 9% reported by Baker and Bellis….  
> Men who have low paternity confidence and have chosen to challenge > their paternity through laboratory testing are much less likely than > men with high paternity confidence to be the fathers of their putative > children. Although these men presumably have lower paternity > confidence than men who do not seek paternity tests, this group is > heterogeneous; some men may be virtually certain that the putative > child is not theirs, while others may simply have sufficient doubts to warrant testing. **Most of these men are in fact the fathers of their putative genetic children; only 29.8% could be excluded as biological fathers of the children in question.**
