Hooray for biology!

Andrew Gelman [weighs in](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/01/thou_shalt_not.html) on whether or not social scientists “know things”, in response to [Robin Hanson’s statement](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/social-scientis.html) that indeed they do. I have no real comment, except to say that I’m moderately pleased to see that he classifies biology as a field that gets shit done.
