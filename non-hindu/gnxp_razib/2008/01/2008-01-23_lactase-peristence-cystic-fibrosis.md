Lactase peristence & Cystic Fibrosis

[Yann](https://yannklimentidis.blogspot.com/2007/01/lactose-persistence-cystic-fibrosis.html) points to a new paper, [new paper](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n3/full/5201749a.html), [Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis and lactase persistence: a possible correlation](http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n3/full/5201749a.html) (Open Access):

The two models to explain the high frequency of the deleterious CF allele in Europeans are that it has a high mutational bias and heterozygote advantage for those with one copy. Most people would say that the latter is much more likely. The authors here propose that the derived CF allele was a really kludgey adaptive response to a new cultural regime predicated on raw milk consumption. Paul has some Ireland [related thoughts](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/6482588516116215453/?src=hsr#2044239) (as usual!). I’ve never seen the term “adaptopgen” before. In any case, I need to think on this case more…but I do think that if human evolution has been on hyperdrive the last 10,000 years we should be many kludgey genetic responses laying around the adaptive landscape…..
