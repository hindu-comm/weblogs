$$$ X Politics ⇒ Red vs. Blue

The always interesting Andrew Gelman, [Rich state, poor state, red-state, blue-state: it’s all about the rich](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/archives/2008/01/rich_state_poor_1.html):

> Thus, the familiar “red America, blue America” pattern, the “culture > war” between red and blue states, is really something happening at the > higher range of incomes.

I believe that the details of history are always driven by battles between the elites….

**Update:** zeil asks if this is a race effect. From [Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State: What’s the Matter with Connecticut?](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/published/rb_qjps.pdf):

> Could the varying income effects we have shown be merely a proxy for > race? This is a potentially plausible story. Perhaps the high slope in > Mississippi reflects poor black Democrats and rich white Republicans, > while Connecticut’s flatter slope arises from its more racially > homogeneous population. To test this, we replicate our analysis, > dropping all Africanâ€“American respondents. This reduces our key > pattern by about half. For example, in a replication of Figure 5, the > slopes for income remain higher in poor states than in rich states, > but these slopes now go from about 0.2 to 0 rather than from 0.4 to 0. >
> To see if the income patterns could be explained by other demographic > variables, we went back to the full dataset for the Annenberg surveys > in 2000 and 2004 and added individual-level predictors for female, > black, four age categories, and four education categories; and > group-level predictors for percent black and average education in each > state. After controlling for all these, the patterns for income > remained: within states, the coefficient for individual income on > probability of Republican vote was positive, with steeper slopes in > poorer states; after controlling for the individual and group-level > predictors, richer states supported the Democrats.
