Bloggingheads.TV, slouching towards dhimmitude?

![galib.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/galib.jpg?resize=350%2C155)![galib.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/galib.jpg?resize=350%2C155)Seriously, what’s up with Robert Wright recruiting a terrorist-looking-dude [to chat](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8223) with [the Elf](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/)? Is there any way this is good for the financial bottom line? Is this the face of D.C. punditry you want to present to a terrified country? Perhaps someone should look into Wright’s bank transaction records and see if some Gulf money has started to flow in…. I mean, there’s always a clean cut guy like [Will Wllkinson](http://www.cato.org/people/wilkinson.html), do we really have such a pundit shortage that we’ve got to yank a mullah off the bench? I mean, the split screen is a little too reminiscent of the partitions between men & women at mosque. Thank god bearded-guy didn’t object to talking to a female; though perhaps the Hadiths make exceptions for sister clades to *H. sapiens sapiens* (I mean, do elves go to hell or heaven?) Come to think of it [Douthat and Yglesias](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/7370) often look like they’re about to interject an “Ibn” into the middle of their names too….  
**Update:** Griping brings [results](http://www.bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8244).
