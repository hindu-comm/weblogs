Which Americans do and don’t accept evolution?

Over at [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/01/who-believes-in.html) there’s some [really interesting crunching](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/01/who-believes-in.html) of the GSS data. Some of it was not surprising to me, you see the same results in [national polls](http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publi.htm) on the topic; blacks are more Creationist than whites, who are more Creationist than Asians. Women are more Creationist than men, as are the poor vs. the rich and the uneducated vs. the more well educated. Then there are the obvious ones; evangelicals are more Creationist than mainline Protestants & Roman Catholics, who are more Creationist than those with no religion. You can find these data pretty easily with 30 seconds of googling, **but [Half Sigma’s regional results](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/01/who-believes-in.html) were pretty new to me, though I was not surprised by rank order.**

The *N*s for some regions aren’t large, check out [Half Sigma’s post](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/01/who-believes-in.html) for the full data. But I suspect this trend is robust and it pretty much matches our priors. It seems to reinforce the perception by many that the South *is different*, and that much of the exceptionalism of American culture can be attributed to this region and its large demographic and social footprint. In contrast, the data from New England bespeaks a culture with sensibilities not unlike much of [Europe or Canada](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html).
