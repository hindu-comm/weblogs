Homosexuaity & blood group & hair & eye color

Via [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/01/sexual-orientation-correlated-with.html), [Eye Color, Hair Color, Blood Type, and the Rhesus Factor: Exploring Possible Genetic Links to Sexual Orientation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18074215):

What do you think? Seems more plausible that the likelihood of homosexual orientation is partly conditional upon the other genetic factors or physiological parameters; rather then there being a common causal root. If, as some argue, homosexuality is due to a relatively recent pathogen then its relationship to particular blood groups may simply be a coincidence of varied immune response of the different ABO & Rh antigens. I would be curious as to the blood group status of the mothers of gay men and women; perhaps it is simply due to physiological conflict (this might be related to sibling order). Like IQ it seems highly likely that there’s a biological component to the variation, but color me skeptical of any locus of large effect.

(FYI, I’m blood group A & Rh+)
