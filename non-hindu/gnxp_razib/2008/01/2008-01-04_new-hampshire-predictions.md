New Hampshire predictions

I note that [Slate](http://slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/Default.aspx) is congratulating a reader who guessed the top 3 finishers for both Repubs and Dems. Well, I got everything right except flipping Biden and Richardson (heard some guy on the radio say he was going for Biden, so I did it for the hell of it!). OK, this is a bit easier I think…but here I go….

  
**Republicans:**  
McCain  
Romney  
Huckabee  
Paul  
Giuliani  
Thompson  
Hunter  
Keyes  
**Democrats:**  
Obama  
Clinton  
Edwards  
Richardson  
Kucinich  
Gravell  
Most of these are “gimmes” now and I’ve followed “conventional wisdom” (e.g., Obama up, Clinton down), with the main exception being that I think Paul will over-perform and pass the deflating Giuliani. Percentages to come…. (after I do a little more reading)
