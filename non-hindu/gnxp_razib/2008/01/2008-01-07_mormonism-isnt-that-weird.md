Mormonism isn’t that weird

Ross Douthat has a [quick comment](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/what_is_it_about_mormonism.php) on a [Noah Feldman](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06mormonism-t.html?ei=5087&em=&en=fc2e77108757dcfe&ex=1199854800&pagewanted=print) piece on [Mormonism](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/magazine/06mormonism-t.html?ei=5087&em=&en=fc2e77108757dcfe&ex=1199854800&pagewanted=print). Feldman is really, really smart; but his argument is a bit more extended than it needs to be. This interest in the religion is basically sparked by the [Romney candidacy](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/09/one-nation-under-gods-and-mitt-romney.php). A few quick points:

  
First, the evangelical Protestant (and to a lesser extent other Christians) hostility toward Mormonism is I think pretty comprehensible and requires little analytic decomposition: they think Mormons are liars. Specifically, Mormon theology is so different from the range of ideas in circulation among “orthodox” Christians that most evangelicals would reject that Mormons are Christian, and Mormon assertion that they are just inflames them further. The details of historical plausibility aren’t really that critical, they’re icing on the cake.  
Second, the strangeness of Mormon beliefs in relation to a comparison point of mainstream Christianity affects the reaction of those who reject mainstream Christian beliefs (and theism in general). An acquaintance of mine who is an atheist and a conservative could not help express contempt and disdain for Romney’s religion above & beyond their typical reaction because the beliefs are so far outside the range of expectation within American culture. In other words, there are only a finite number of religious schemas which Americans, even non-religious ones, find acceptable. The antiquity fixation that some exhibit is simply the packaging; there is obviously a range of “acceptability” for secular, but not Sam Harris level hostile, intellectuals in regards to religion. Some “spirituality” is better than other “religions.” An important side point I suspect is that Feldman is right to juxtapose Mormonism’s “All American” exoteric presentation as opposed to its rather atypical esoteric beliefs. If Mitt Romney had brown skin and wore a turban he wouldn’t even get to the point of running for president, but I also doubt that liberal intellectuals would be as comfortable mocking him.  
Third, I have to make something explicit: **though I find Mormonism less plausible in the secondary details in its scripture, I find the theology central to the religion more coherent than that of mainstream Christianity.** I think it is pretty clear that the civilization described in the Book of Mormon was invented by Joseph Smith working off ideas and preconceptions in the Zeitgeist of early 19th century antiquarian America. In contrast, the Hebrew Bible, the Gospels, the Koran, etc., have a much higher proportion of historically plausible events and acts (the Hebrew Bible has historically confirmed events embedded within it, not simply plausible ones). That being said, I find the Mormon concept of God as a material being intelligible via common sense reflection much more coherent than the mainstream Christian positions expressed in the [Athanasian Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed#The_Trinity). I don’t happen to believe the Mormon position in regards to God, but I actually understand what they’re trying to say. Though I don’t have the normal sociological prejudice against Mormons, I am thinking I might have to reconsider why I tend to accept the proposition that Mormonism is more ludicrous based on avowed beliefs.
