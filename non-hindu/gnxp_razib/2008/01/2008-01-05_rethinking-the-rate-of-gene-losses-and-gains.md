Rethinking the rate of gene losses and gains

In the comments on [a previous post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/01/edge-2008-question.php), I made reference to [a paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000085) by Demuth et al. on the evolution of gene families in mammals. As this was published in PLoS One, I took a look at [the annotations](http://www.plosone.org/annotation/getCommentary.action;jsessionid=FADA3F220866437FCDA49BF19B9A0A68?target=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000085). One of the comments [by Laurent Duret](http://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-Duret-Laurent-.html?lang=en) brings up a potentially major issue–the authors use a database of gene families for their analysis, but don’t try to test how exhaustive the database is. He continues:

I think it’s fair to say that any of the numbers on gene losses/gains between species presented in this paper should be taken with a grain of salt. This is one of the advantages of the PLoS One system–critiques can be appended directly rather than floating around unpublished or getting published in a minor journal. (Of course, the modal paper published by PLoS One probably doesn’t get read closely enough to generate real critiques.)

Addendum: a reader points out that overestimating the number of gene extinctions by a factor of 100% is, in fact, not overestimating it at all (a factor of 100% is a factor of 1). Perhaps Dr. Duret should have written something like “a false positive rate of 100%”, but I imagine everyone got his point.
