Jerry Coyne smacks down Olivia Judson

Wow. Well, [Jerry Coyne](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/coyne.html) has never been one for weak words. A few days ago evolutionary biologist & journalist [Olivia Judson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Judson) posted [The Monster is Back, and It’s Hopeful](http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/the-monster-is-back-and-its-hopeful/) on her blog [The Wild Side](http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/). Jerry Coyne, a prominent evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and co-author of the magisterial [Speciation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878930892/geneexpressio-20/), has posted a [strongly worded response](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/01/24/hopeless_monstersa_guest_post.php) over at [Carl Zimmer’s weblog:](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/01/24/hopeless_monstersa_guest_post.php)

> [Judson commits two errors of reasoning when arguing a la Goldschmidt > (or Gould). The first is what I call the “macromutationist fallacy,” > for this error is so common that it deserves a name. It is this: we > see some single mutations within species that make big changes in a > trait, and then infer that differences between species in that same > trait are also due to mutations in that same gene, or to other > mutations of large effect. Judson makes this mistake when discussing > the naked head of the vulture, presumably an adaptation for sticking > its noggin into rotten meat. She thinks that the loss of vulture head feathers may well be due to a single mutation because there are occasional mutations in domestic chickens that give them bare heads and necks.

These macromutations, like > those producing bald chickens, almost always have highly deleterious > side effects that make them unlikely to form the basis for evolution > in nature. In fact, many cultivated species would never survive, much > less take over, in the wild. Domestic corn is good to eat, but would > never thrive in nature because the seeds don’t disperse. Or, take > single mutations having drastic effects on body size. One of these, > achondroplastic dwarfism in humans, has severe negative effects on > health and reproduction. Saying that the bald-chicken mutation implies > that vultures lost their top feathers courtesy of a single mutation is > like saying that because there is dwarfism in humans, the size > difference between humans and chimps must have the same genetic basis > as achrondroplasty. Most big-effect mutations that occur in the laboratory, greenhouse, or henhouse could never survive in nature, and have to be coddled by humans to survive.](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/01/24/hopeless_monstersa_guest_post.php)

[Read the whole thing! (as they say) Interesting that Coyne, a serious contributor to evolutionary scholarship, has gotten his hands dirty and reached out to the public so directly to correct what he perceives is journalistic malpractice. Hey](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/01/24/hopeless_monstersa_guest_post.php) [Dick Lewontin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin), I’d be willing to set up a blog for you if you want now that you’re emeritus….  
**Note:** Coyne is a traditionalist who doesn’t suffer fools; his [recent critiques](https://evolgen.blogspot.com/2005/06/coyne-versus-carroll.html) of [evo-devo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology) make this sort of sally understandable. The ideas resurrected by Judson are fundamentally more radical than anything Sean Carroll has proposed. But, I do want to offer that I remember listening to a young zebrafish researcher explaining how shocked he was a lot of the extant variation they saw was controlled by only a few genes. There is a real story to be told about the exposure via genomics that many quantitative traits are controlled by a few loci of large effect as opposed to architectures hypothesized by the infinitesimal models….
