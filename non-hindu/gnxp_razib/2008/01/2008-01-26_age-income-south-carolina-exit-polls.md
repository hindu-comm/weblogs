Age & income: South Carolina exit polls

Was checking out the [exit poll data](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/epolls/#SCDEM). Two things that jumped out at me….  
Here are the votes for Obama from non-blacks in the South Carolina primary by age:  
18-29 – 52%  
30-44 – 25%  
45-59 – 23%  
60+ – 15%  
Here are the votes by income for Edwards:  
Under \$15,000 – 14%  
\$15,000-\$30,000 – 15%  
\$30,000-\$50,000 – 16%  
\$50,000-\$75,000 – 22%  
\$75,000-\$100,000 – 26%  
\$100,000-\$150,000 – 24%  
\$150,000-\$200,000 – not enough data  
\$200,000 or more – 29%  
**Update:** [Andrew Sullivan](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/01/exit-poll-nugge.html) says:

> Then this: Obama won every demographic among the religiously > observant. And the more devout they are – judging by their church attendance – the better he did. **His narrowest margins against Clinton and Edwards were among those who never attend church services.**

In [New Hampshire](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/epolls/index.html#NHDEM) and [Nevada](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/epolls/#NVDEM) we have data which suggests Obama is stronger among the more secular (no data from Iowa that I can see). But I think the most plausible explanation is that what you’re seeing in South Carolina is the impact of the black vote; [blacks are more religious than whites](http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&BarnaUpdateID=169). Just as younger whites (there aren’t many Latino or Asian American voters in South Carolina from what I can tell from the exit polls) were more favorable toward Obama than older whites, I would be willing to bet that wealthier and more educated whites would also lean in his direction compared to poorer and less educated whites. Whatever you might say about it, but Obama does have a diverse coalition, and not just in terms of race. (though to be fair, one can say that about the Democratic party as a whole of late, with a coalition of racial and ethnic minorities, the remaining white working class vote as well as social issue driven professionals).
