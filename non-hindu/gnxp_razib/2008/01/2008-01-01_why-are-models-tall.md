Why are models tall?

First, happy New Year! Second, when I saw [this post](http://blog.behavioralecology.net/2008/01/why-are-models-tall-anyway/) from Matt in the referrals I assumed he was going to be offering some skepticism as to the utility of formal models in science. No, not really, not *that type* of model. The sort that our resident [callipygiaphile](https://akinokure.blogspot.com/) [ruminates](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/female-sex-symbols-somewhat-taller-than.php) upon.
