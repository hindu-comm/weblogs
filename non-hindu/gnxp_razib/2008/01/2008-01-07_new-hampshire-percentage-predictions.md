New Hampshire percentage predictions

The primary happens tomorrow, and I’m ready with my predictions (see my Iowa outcome).

  
**Republicans:**  
McCain – 33%  
Romney – 30%  
Huckabee – 14%  
Paul – 12%  
Giuliani – 7%  
Thompson – 3%  
Hunter – 1%  
Keyes – 0%

**Democrats:**  
Obama – 45%  
Clinton – 30%  
Edwards – 19%  
Richardson – 4%  
Kucinich – 2%  
Gravel – 0%  
Pretty obvious, the main thing is that I think that we haven’t seen the Obama crest in the polls, and I suspect that Paul will do better than Giuliani because of the dynamics of the New Hampshire electorate.
