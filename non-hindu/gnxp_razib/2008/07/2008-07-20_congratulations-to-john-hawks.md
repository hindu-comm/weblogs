Congratulations to John Hawks!

John Hawks is now a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsin, heâ€™s announced in [the inaugural post](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/meta/tenure-blog-prosper-2008.html) of a four-part series on academic blogging. The entire thing is well worth a read for anyone who hopes to end up in a similar situation.
