Summers part 29,476

Slate has been having a debate on sex differences. [Along the way](http://www.slate.com/id/2194486/entry/2194525/), they hit on a key Summers issue: The apparent higher male variability of math scores. Shaffer, the author, refers to the [classic Feingold piece](http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3575318245761hg/), a cross-cultural meta-study of the variability of mental abilities across genders. Shaffer makes the common claim that there are data on both sides–sometimes women have a higher variance, and sometimes the men do. But is the difference statistically significant?

I did a simple analysis of Feingold’s data from 54 math tests from 20 countries, and 19 tests of spatial ability from 9 countries. I ran least squares and least absolute deviation tests.

Here are the p-values for the restriction that men and women have equal variability:

Math, least squares: p
