HIV may not be associated to Duffy!?!?!

Over the past few days I’ve blogged a bit about the story about an HIV susceptibility allele; Evolution, a reason for the African HIV epidemic?, Overplaying “AIDS genes” and HIV susceptibility, a “black” thing, not a Duffy thing?. But there’s an important post [Genetic Future](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/duffy-hiv-association-odd-choice-of.html), [Duffy-HIV association: an odd choice of ancestry markers](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/duffy-hiv-association-odd-choice-of.html):

> In the Duffy study the authors attempt to perform this type of > correction using a set of just 11 markers they describe as > “differentially distributed between European and African populations”. > p-ter notes that several of these markers are not particularly > ancestry-informative, and indeed on closer inspection it’s clear why > this is: these genes weren’t originally selected on the basis of > ancestry informativeness, but rather because they are associated with > HIV biology. Every single one of the 11 markers has some association > with HIV: three of them have previously been associated with HIV > infection, progression, or response to treatment ([CCR5 > delta32](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8751444), [APOBEC3G > H186R](http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/78/20/11070?view=long&pmid=15452227), > [GNB3 C825T](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16354603)); most of > the remaining markers are in genes that are known binding targets or > modulators of HIV > ([CCR5](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=18402), > [CXCR4](http://www.mcld.co.uk/hiv/?q=CXCR4), > [PD1](http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/203/10/2281), > [TRIM5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16815734), > [IL-2](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2000/il2-haart.htm), > [IL-4](http://www.jleukbio.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/3/340)).

> If that’s true – and it’s difficult to see any other rationale for > using these HIV markers rather than a set of validated AIMs – this is > poor form for at least two reasons. Firstly, it’s unlikely that using > such a weak set of ancestry-informative markers provides an effective > correction for a marker with as strong a correlation with ancestry as > Duffy (as p-ter notes, all of the supposed ancestry markers are far > weaker predictors of ancestry than the Duffy variant).

Read the whole thing…**but something is starting to smell fishy.** Hey [Dave Appell](https://davidappell.blogspot.com/2008/07/blogosphere.html), blogs rock and peer review sucks! (sometimes)
