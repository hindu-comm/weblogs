HIV susceptibility, a “black” thing, not a Duffy thing?

This is why mapping human variation is so important. Note that the genetic variation itself might not even be responsible for greater susceptibility to HIV in a causal sense; if [circumcision](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=circumcision+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) does have a role in reducing the spread of HIV then cultural practices which correlate with genetic variation can also produce spurious correlations. As an illustrative example in South Africa there is a correlation between HIV infection rates and decreased Khoisan ancestry. I say this because the Zulus have higher infection rates than the Xhosa, and the latter have a great deal more Khoisan ancestry than the former. The differences have been attributed to the fact that the Xhosa practice circumcision and the Zulu do not, so the differences in genes is just coincidental.
