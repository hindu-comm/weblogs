Drugs & science & insight

I posted before on Why scientists should do drugs (if they choose), via [Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/the-eureka-hunt.html), a [Jonah Lehrer](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2008/07/the_neuroscience_of_insight.php) [article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/28/080728fa_fact_lehrer) in *The New Yorker*:

> Many stimulants, like caffeine, Adderall, and Ritalin, are taken to > increase focus — one recent poll found that nearly twenty percent of > scientists and researchers regularly took prescription drugs to > “enhance concentration” — but, accordingly to Jung-Beeman and Kounios, > **drugs may actually make insights less like, by sharpening the > spotlight of attention and discouraging mental rambles**. > Concentration, it seems, comes with the hidden cost of diminished > creativity. “There’s a good reason Google puts Ping-Pong tables in > their headquarters,” Kounios said. “I you want to encourage insights, > then you’ve got to also encourage people to relax.” Jung-Beeman’s latest paper investigates why people who are in a good mood are so much better at solving insight puzzles. (On average, they solve nearly twenty percent more C.R.A. problems.)

In other words, what may make a more efficient engineer may also dampen creativity in a theoretical physicist….
