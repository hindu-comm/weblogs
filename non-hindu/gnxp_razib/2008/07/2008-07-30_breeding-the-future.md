Breeding the future

Some results from the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss06) on what people perceive the ideal number of children is based on social variables. Additionally, the realized number of children the respondent has. I limited the sample to whites who were 40 or older (there are people who have children past 40, but I assume that most of the discrepancy, or not, between ideal and realized will be evident by that age).
