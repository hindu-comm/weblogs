No Polynesian origin for pre-Columbian chickens???

[Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/30/10308.short?rss=1):

> European chickens were introduced into the American continents by the > Spanish after their arrival in the 15th century. **However, there is > ongoing debate as to the presence of pre-Columbian chickens among > Amerindians in South America**, particularly in relation to Chilean > breeds such as the Araucana and Passion Fowl…The modern Chilean > sequences cluster closely with haplotypes predominantly distributed > among European, Indian subcontinental, and Southeast Asian chickens, > consistent with a European genetic origin. A published, apparently > pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian > specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian > subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a > Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America….
