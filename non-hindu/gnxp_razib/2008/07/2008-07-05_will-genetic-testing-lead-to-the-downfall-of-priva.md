Will genetic testing lead to the downfall of private insurance?

That’s what [Daniel](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/genetic-testing-and-end-of-private.html) is asking at [Genetic Future](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/genetic-testing-and-end-of-private.html), and he is soliciting the input of the economically informed. I’ve closed comments on this post so as to encourage you to leave comments there if you have something intelligent to say. Also, Dan [posted last year](http://www.tdaxp.com/archive/2007/08/24/the-end-of-private-insurance.html). FWIW I am moderately skeptical of health benefits for the average person re: genomics as I recall several years back steakhouses were supposedly attributing their robust business to the ubiquity of statins. I suspect quantitative improvements in healthcare will have more relevance toward combining lifestyle choices with the current expectations of life expectancy and quality of life as opposed to pushing the longevity window outward much. The ubiquity of fatitude makes me skeptical that we’re going in any direction aside from risking-pooling. BTW, Half Sigma has recently [been](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/07/response-to-comments-on-socialized-medicine.html) [promoting](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/07/republicans-should-support-socialized-medicine.html) socialized medicine.
