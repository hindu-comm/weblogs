When not going to church signals something

When [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/06/43-of-young-men-who-never-go-to-church.html) observed that [the unchurched tend more toward criminality](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/06/43-of-young-men-who-never-go-to-church.html), I
[asked](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/are-unchurched-criminals.php) whether social matrix would be a major factor here. In other words, in an area where church going is a major signal of social conformity antisocial oddballs would be far more likely to break the the norm. With [a follow up](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/07/explaining-connection-between-never.html) [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/07/explaining-connection-between-never.html) says:

A meta-point here (and obvious one to many of you no doubt) is that religion can not be understood simply as a relationship between an individual and their faith in an atomic manner. The social dimension in critical to mass religion.
