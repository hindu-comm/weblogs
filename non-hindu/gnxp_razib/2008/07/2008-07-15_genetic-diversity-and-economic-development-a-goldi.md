Genetic Diversity and Economic Development: A Goldilocks Story

From [Oded Galor](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/galor-and-moav-property-rights-as.php) and his promising grad student Quamrul Ashraf, [another paper](http://ideas.repec.org/p/bro/econwp/2008-3.html) that ties together genes and group productivity.

Their big result (Figure 5 below) is that a population cluster’s genetic heterozygosity has a Goldilocks relationship with population density in 1500AD: Too much heterozygosity (Sub-Saharan Africa) or too little heterozygosity (Americas) predicts low population density. And in a pre-modern world (heck, even in the [modern](http://conneva.com/blog/archives/images/Hong%20Kong%20Island%20At%20Night.jpg) [world](http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/10d-2/new-york-city-at-night.jpg)), population density is a rough measure of technological progress.

Surprisingly, the Goldilocks result holds even when you control for a bunch of other stuff like arable land and the timing of a population’s agricultural transition. And perhaps most surprisingly, the much-hyped correlation between latitude and population density vanishes when you control for pretty much anything in addition to latitude. So the “distance from the equator” variable that growth economists spend [so much time](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=latitude+%22economic+growth%22+equator&btnG=Search) on may just be epiphenomenal.

The authors admit they don’t have a great theory for why the warm porridge tastes bestâ€“the goal of their paper is basically to get the Goldilocks result out there for others to work on. Here’s hoping some economists take the bait…..

Bonus: Portfolio’s Zubin Jelveh [gets Galor to comment](http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/odd-numbers/2008/01/31/guns-germs-and-steel-and-genetics) on what all this means for Jared Diamond.
