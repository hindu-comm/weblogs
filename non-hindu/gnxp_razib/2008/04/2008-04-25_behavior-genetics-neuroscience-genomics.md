Behavior genetics + neuroscience + genomics = ?

[Genetic variation in human *NPY* expression affects stress response and emotion](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7190/abs/nature06858.html):

> Understanding inter-individual differences in stress response requires > the explanation of genetic influences at multiple phenotypic levels, > including complex behaviours and the metabolic responses of brain > regions to emotional stimuli. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is anxiolytic…and > its release is induced by stress…NPY is abundantly expressed in > regions of the limbic system that are implicated in arousal and in the > assignment of emotional valences to stimuli and memories…Here we show > that haplotype-driven *NPY* expression predicts brain responses to > emotional and stress challenges and also inversely correlates with > trait anxiety. *NPY* haplotypes predicted levels of *NPY* messenger > RNA in post-mortem brain and lymphoblasts, and levels of plasma NPY. > Lower haplotype-driven *NPY* expression predicted higher > emotion-induced activation of the amygdala, as well as diminished > resiliency as assessed by pain/stress-induced activations of > endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions. **A > single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs16147) located in the promoter > region alters *NPY* expression *in vitro* and seems to account for > more than half of the variation in expression *in vivo*. These convergent findings are consistent with the function of NPY as an anxiolytic peptide and help to explain inter-individual variation in resiliency to stress, a risk factor for many diseases.**

Don’t know quite what to make of these results,¹ but I’m sure I’m not the only one who is curious when SNP’s are implicated in behavioral variation. The great thing about science is that nature is one; which means that the [post-genomic era](http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/05/186212) has changed the game in a whole host of fields. Here you have a study attempting to smoke out individual differences manifested on the level of psychology, rooted in part on genetic variance which is mediated by neurological and molecular genetic processes. Many years ago the psychologist Jerome Kagan found that [Asian babies are calmer than European ones](https://books.google.com/books?id=JynhysOSKWYC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=jerome+kagan+asian++caucasian&source=web&ots=43zfmjSjGv&sig=gBFPyF1bQbShR-1xRWVAUrZ5xA8&hl=en). Why? If there is a genetic component to the variance of this trait, and the distribution of the causal genes differ between groups, then we may have a simple explanation for this phenomenon. I see no reason that between group differences are going to be limited to disease, and as [the cost of genome sequencing converges upon triviality](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/005150.html) we’ll find out as much there is to find out when it comes to personality variation, as it seems to me that many psychological phenotypes might have [QTLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_inheritance) of relatively large effect.  
**Related:** [Behavioral Genetics in the Postgenomic Era](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1557989265/geneexpressio-20) is a touch dated (it was published in 2002!), but it can still serve as a nice soft-landing to this ripening field. Jonah [comments on the neuroscience angle](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2008/04/razib_calls_my_attention_to.php).  
1 – If there is between group variation, many times Africans exhibit more heterozygosity than Europeans & Asians. This is easily comprehensible when you recall that Africans seem to have more extant genetic diversity than non-Africans, possibly for [historical-demographic reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Africa_theory).
