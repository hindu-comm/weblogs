Swarming loci; the genetics of height

[Identification of ten loci associated with height highlights new biological pathways in human growth](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.125.html) & [Genome-wide association analysis identifies 20 loci that influence adult height](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.121.html). [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080406153335.htm) has a [long review](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080406153335.htm).

**Update:** I was pretty sure [Genetic Future](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/04/height-and-hypertension-genes-in-nature.html) would hit this, so I didn’t say much. Well, here’s what [he notes](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/04/height-and-hypertension-genes-in-nature.html):

This is a > powerful demonstration of the inability of current GWAS technology to > access the genetic variants responsible for the vast majority of heritable variation in at least some complex traits, for reasons I have [previously discussed in detail](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/03/why-do-genome-wide-scans-fail.html).

The bolded parts are exactly right in my estimation; of course nearly a century of biometric analysis of human height should lead us to expect this. In contrast, [50 years ago](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/skin-color-loci-older-work.php) there was pedigree based work which implied that skin color was going to resolve itself so that about half a dozen loci of large effect explaining most of the variance. That’s what we see.

But I think height is important & interesting. Our species [has shrunk](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/09/tall_to_short_to_tall_again.php) since the last Ice Age (even modern nutrition hasn’t brought us all the way back). Why? Cross-cultural evidence seems to suggest that [tall men are more reproductively fit](http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/05/08/03/how_much_of_an_advantage_do_tall_men_have_are_tall_men_really_better_off.htm), but the fact that there is a normal range of variation within populations tells us that strong directional selection hasn’t been effective over the long term. Otherwise, variation would quickly be exhausted. But it seems likely that some of the [between-population differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Average_adult_height_around_the_world) are due to genetic differences.
