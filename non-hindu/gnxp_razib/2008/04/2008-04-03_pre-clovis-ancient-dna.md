pre-Clovis ancient DNA?

[DNA from Pre-Clovis Human Coprolites in Imbler, North America](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1154116):

> The timing of the first human migration into the Americas and its > relation to the appearance of the Clovis technological complex in > North America ca. 11-10.8 thousand radiocarbon years before present > (14C ka B.P.) remains contentious. We establish that humans were > present at Paisley 5 Mile Point Caves, south-central Oregon, by 12,300 > 14C yr. B.P., through recovery of human mtDNA from coprolites, > directly dated by accelerator mass spectrometry. The mtDNA corresponds to Native American founding haplogroups A2 and B2. The dates of the coprolites are \>1000 14C years earlier than currently accepted dates for the Clovis-complex.

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080403141109.htm) has a really [long review](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080403141109.htm) of the results & their implications.
