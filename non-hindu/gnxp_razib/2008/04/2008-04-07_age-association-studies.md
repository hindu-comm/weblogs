Age & association studies?

When it comes to association studies population substructure is something you have to keep in mind, but what about age? [On the Replication of Genetic Associations: Timing Can Be Everything!](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2808%2900174-2):

> The failure of researchers to replicate genetic-association findings > is most commonly attributed to insufficient statistical power, > population stratification, or various forms of between-study > heterogeneity or environmental > influences[](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2808%2900174-2#bib1)…Here, > we illustrate another potential cause for nonreplications that has so > far not received much attention in the literature. We illustrate that > the strength of a genetic effect can vary by age, causing “age-varying > associations.” If not taken into account during the design and the > analysis of a study, age-varying genetic associations can cause > nonreplication. By using the 100K SNP scan of the Framingham Heart > Study, we identified an age-varying association between a SNP in > *ROBO1* and obesity and hypothesized an age-gene interaction. This > finding was followed up in eight independent samples comprising 13,584 > individuals. The association was replicated in five of the eight > studies, showing an age-dependent relationship…Furthermore, this study > illustrates that it is difficult for cross-sectional study designs to > detect age-varying associations. If the specifics of age- or > time-varying genetic effects are not considered in the selection of > both the follow-up samples and in the statistical analysis, important > genetic associations may be missed.
