Speciation & gene flow

[Speciation with gene flow could be common](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03715.x):

> The likelihood of speciation in the face of homogenizing gene flow > (i.e. without complete geographical isolation) is one of the most > debated topics in evolutionary biology. Demonstrating this phenonemon > is hampered by the difficulty of isolating the effects of time since > population divergence vs. gene flow on levels of molecular genetic > differentiation. For example, weak genetic differentiation between > taxa could be due to recent divergence, gene flow, or a combination of > these factors. Nonetheless, a number of convincing examples of > speciation with gene flow have recently emerged, owing in part to the > development of new analytical methods designed to estimate gene flow > specifically. A recent example of speciation with gene flow in > salamanders ([Niemiller *et al*. 2008](popRef('b6'))) further advances > our understanding of this phenonemon, by showing that gene flow > between cave and spring salamanders was ongoing during speciation, > rather than having occurred after a long period of allopatric > divergence. Future work on the ecological and genetic factors reducing > gene flow will likely increase our understanding of the conditions > that faciliate divergence in the face of gene flow.
