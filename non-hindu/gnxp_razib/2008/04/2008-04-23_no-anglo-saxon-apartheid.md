No Anglo-Saxon Apartheid?

[Is it necessary to assume an apartheid-like social structure in Early Anglo-Saxon England?](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/0285423800626071/) :

> It has recently been argued that there was an apartheid-like social > structure operating in Early Anglo-Saxon England. This was proposed in > order to explain the relatively high degree of similarity between > Germanic-speaking areas of northwest Europe and England. Opinions vary > as to whether there was a substantial Germanic invasion or only a > relatively small number arrived in Britain during this period. > Contrary to the assumption of limited intermarriage made in the > apartheid simulation, there is evidence that significant mixing of the > British and Germanic peoples occurred, and that the early law codes, > such as that of King Ine of Wessex, could have deliberately encouraged > such mixing. More importantly, the simulation did not take into > account any northwest European immigration that arrived both before > and after the Early Anglo-Saxon period. In view of the uncertainty of > the places of origin of the various Germanic peoples, and their > numbers and dates of arrival, the present study adopts an alternative > approach to estimate the percentage of indigenous Britons in the > current British population. It was found unnecessary to introduce any special social structure among the diverse Anglo-Saxon people in order to account for the estimates of northwest European intrusion into the British population.

  
This is a rejoinder to [Evidence for an apartheid-like social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England](Evidence%20for%20an%20Apartheid-like%20Social%20Structure%20in%20Anglo-Saxon%20England). Exciting times. I don’t have the time to read this right now…but I would suggest that islands are quite often rather surprisingly insulated from continuous gene flow. Granted, the English Channel is rather a narrow chasm, but sufficient to block land-based invasions since 1066. The “apartheid” argument seemed rather extreme to me at the time, but I am inclined toward accepting the reality of a significant demographic discontinuity around the 5th-6th centuries….
