Gene Genie #30

![gene_genie_logo_400.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gene_genie_logo_400.jpg?resize=300%2C120)![gene_genie_logo_400.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gene_genie_logo_400.jpg?resize=300%2C120)**Welcome to the 30^(th) [Gene Genie](http://genegenie.wordpress.com/)!**  
[Indulge in the fascinating world of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine](http://tomographyblog.com/2008/04/17/home-improvement-for-geneticists/) has a “genetics lifestyle” post, [Home Improvement For Geneticists](http://tomographyblog.com/2008/04/17/home-improvement-for-geneticists/). Not quite Tim Allen. Fellow [ScienceBlogger](http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2008/04/mapping_polymorphisms_in_16s_r.php) [Sandra](http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2008/04/mapping_polymorphisms_in_16s_r.php) illustrates [Mapping polymorphisms in 16S ribosomal RNA](http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2008/04/mapping_polymorphisms_in_16s_r.php). Definitely worth checking out, anyone interested in biology should be down with [ribosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome), and [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA#Importance_of_rRNA) has also been critical in taxonomy. [Biotech Weblog](http://www.biotech-weblog.com/50226711/gene_therapy_may_treat_cocaine_addiction.php) notes that [Gene Therapy May Treat Cocaine Addiction](http://www.biotech-weblog.com/50226711/gene_therapy_may_treat_cocaine_addiction.php). ‘nuf said. Migraines affect about 1 out of 6 people in the world; so pay attention when [Genetics and Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2008/04/20/genetic-breakthrough-for-migraine-sufferers/) suggest the possibility for a [Genetic breakthrough for migraine sufferers](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2008/04/20/genetic-breakthrough-for-migraine-sufferers/). KQED’s [Quest](http://www.kqed.org/quest/radio/view/836) offers a podcast which illuminates the light shed upon [Human Genetics through Dogs](http://www.kqed.org/quest/radio/view/836). Have you read [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20)? Then you *must* read [Yann Klimentidis](https://yannklimentidis.blogspot.com/2008/04/do-clines-of-genetic-diversity-say.html), [p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/picture-is-worth-thousand-words-part-n.php) and [G](https://popgen-ramblings.blogspot.com/2008/04/sines-of-expansion.html); beware of how [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis) is displayed! We live in a world where hundreds of thousands of Americans are currently stationed in Iraq. So it is probably important to wonder about [A Genetic Susceptibility to PTSD?](http://brainblogger.com/2008/04/16/a-genetic-susceptibility-to-ptsd/), as [Brain Blogger](http://brainblogger.com/2008/04/16/a-genetic-susceptibility-to-ptsd) does. [Think Gene](http://www.thinkgene.com/scientists-clarify-a-mechanism-of-epigenetic-inheritance/) engages in a little heresy from the [Central Dogma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology), blogging the revolution as [Scientists clarify a mechanism of epigenetic inheritance](http://www.thinkgene.com/scientists-clarify-a-mechanism-of-epigenetic-inheritance/). Are you going to be well aged? [Ouroboros](http://ouroboros.wordpress.com/2008/04/24/is-there-anything-sirt1-cant-do/) asks [Is there anything SIRT1 can’t do?](http://ouroboros.wordpress.com/2008/04/24/is-there-anything-sirt1-cant-do/) It might be part of the answer, along with a helping hand from our friends at Big Pharma. You hear a lot about [Hox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_genes) genes, especially with the rise of [evo-devo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo-devo), [DNA and You](http://genomicmd.typepad.com/dna_and_you/2008/04/can-you-hear-me.html) makes it a bit personal. [A HOXA2 mutation is responsible for one type of autosomal recessive microtia (congenital deformity of the outer ear)](http://genomicmd.typepad.com/dna_and_you/2008/04/can-you-hear-me.html), a mouthful that remains relevant.  
Speaking of which, let’s move specifically into the domain of **Personalized Genetics**:

  
About 10% of all cancer is breast cancer, so when [Genetics and Health](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2008/04/23/gene-signature-found-for-breast-cancer-survival/) observes that [Gene signature found for breast cancer survival](http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2008/04/23/gene-signature-found-for-breast-cancer-survival/), everyone should listen up. Speaking of an impact on millions & millions, [Eye on DNA](http://www.eyeondna.com/2008/04/23/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-gina-nears-unanimous-consent-passage-in-us-senate/) observes that [Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) Nears Unanimous Consent Passage in U.S. Senate](http://www.eyeondna.com/2008/04/23/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-gina-nears-unanimous-consent-passage-in-us-senate/). This is only the beginning, genes will now impinge more and more into the public consciousness through policy and legislation. [Gene Sherpas](https://thegenesherpa.blogspot.com/2008/04/timely-release-and-unanimous-vote.html) adds voices to the conversation, [Timely Release and A Unanimous Vote](https://thegenesherpa.blogspot.com/2008/04/timely-release-and-unanimous-vote.html), while [The Genetic Genealogist](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2008/04/24/finally-gina-gets-her-day/) makes it a hat-trick with [Finally, GINA Gets Her Day](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2008/04/24/finally-gina-gets-her-day/). Of course, GINA is important because of companies like Navigenics. [Predicter Blog](https://predicter.blogspot.com/2008/04/navigenics-enters-personal-genomics.html) continues the conversation on personal genomics with [Navigenics Enters Personal Genomics Game … Meanwhile: “What’s a SNP?”](https://predicter.blogspot.com/2008/04/navigenics-enters-personal-genomics.html). Taking a step back from the nitty-gritty of public policy & business, [Genetic Future](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/04/genome-wide-association-studies-taken.html) offers up the big picture with [Genome-wide association studies taken to the next level](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/04/genome-wide-association-studies-taken.html). If you don’t know what a genome-wide association is, then you get less return on value for boning up on GINA. Finally, getting back to the pragmatic big picture, [ScienceRoll](http://scienceroll.com/2008/04/18/personalized-genetics-are-we-ready/) asks, [Personalized Genetics: Are we ready?](http://scienceroll.com/2008/04/18/personalized-genetics-are-we-ready/).  
The next edition will be published at [Adaptive Complexity](http://www.scientificblogging.com/mwhite74) on 11 May 2008! (a blog you should already be reading)
