Vitamin D deficiency makes you dumb?

[Vitamin D Important In Brain Development And Function](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080421072159.htm):

As you might know, it seems that most dark-skinned people at higher latitudes have a deficiency. Also, tests of natural selection seem to suggest that humans have become *far lighter* over the past 10-20,000 years. Why?  
Here’s the citation:  
McCann, JC, Ames BN (2008) Review Article: Is there convincing biological or behavioral evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to brain dysfunction” FASEB J. 22: 982-1001.  
The paper is [not online](http://www.fasebj.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml) yet….  
A word of caution: many nutrients are involved in thousands of biochemical pathways. The main reason I focus on Vitamin D is that the data for selection of lighter skin at northern latitudes is very powerful….
