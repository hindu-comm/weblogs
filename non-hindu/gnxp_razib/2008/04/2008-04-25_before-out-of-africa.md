Before Out of Africa….

A new paper, [The Dawn of Human Matrilineal Diversity](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2808%2900255-3?large_figure=true), is out in *AJHG*. I [read too much John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/weaver_roseman_2005.html?seemore=y) to really be all that excited about [mtDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervariable_control_region) based studies, and this paper is [Mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve) to the nth power. But…I do think it is indicative of a trend which suggests a rollback from the most extreme [Out of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans) scenarios; i.e., that one band somewhere in Eastern Africa arose \~100,000 years ago and expanded demographically so that they were the exclusive ancestors of all human beings.1 The [introgression story](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/11/neanderthal-introgression.php) is one angle; but the likelihood of preexistent population substructure within Africa itself is another. If you don’t read the paper (which is Open Access), just check out [Figure 1](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/images/S0002-9297%2808%2900255-3?imageId=gr1&imageType=large) and [the map](http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/images/S0002-9297%2808%2900255-3?imageId=gr2&imageType=large). Breathless [description of the study](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080424130710.htm) over at ScienceDaily of course….

1 – Some of this was more about public perception than reality; just like the one mtDNA ancestor was conflated with one female ancestor (the same trick of course applied to the [NRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup)).
