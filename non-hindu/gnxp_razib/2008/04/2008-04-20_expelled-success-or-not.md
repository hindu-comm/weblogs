Expelled, success or not?

Chris Mooney [is claiming *Expelled* is a box office success](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2008/04/expelled_a_box_office_success.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=channellink). Documentaries don’t make a very big splash typically, but whatever you think about the impact of *Expelled*, the fact that [*Fahrenheit 9/11*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11) will go down as a much bigger success illustrates the contrast between depth and breadth of feeling from their respective audiences. Michael Moore’s politics have a smaller potential audience than the half of Americans who are Creationist, and the 3/4 of Americans who are open to the idea of “equal time,” but the devotees of Moore’s brand of Leftism are far more intense in their sentiment. I am not totally ignorant of the dynamics of Creationist politics in the United States, the history seems to be one where every time the movement manages to exceed a particular threshold of success a counter-reaction quickly dampens its damage. Despite the broad sympathy from the masses for the Creationist cause the intensity of elite feeling on this topic means that a position held by half of Americans remains marginal in the commanding heights of the culture.  
Here’s the assessment from [Weekend Box Office](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Weekend-Box-Office-The-Forbidden-Kingdom-8562.html):

> Ben Stein’s documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed managed to > make it all the way to ninth place despite only showing on 1,000 > screens. The beauty of documentaries these days is that you have some > kind of built in audience so long as your subject matter and approach > is controversial enough.  
> It’s a secret Michael Moore has been using to milk millions out of > anti-Bushites for the last few years and now Expelled is benefitting. > It doesn’t matter how much merit Stein’s message has, you can bet no > one saw it who didn’t already agree with him.  
> While the movie has done moderately well in small release compared to > most movies in small release, in the world of documentaries its > nothing to get excited about. It will be lucky to break into the > overall documentary top ten. Not too impressive since the other three > documentaries that have made it to more than 1,000 screens are the top > three financial performers.
