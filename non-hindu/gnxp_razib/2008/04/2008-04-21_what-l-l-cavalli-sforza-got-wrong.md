What L. L. Cavalli-Sforza got wrong?

[History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20) is one of my favorite books; it might rank up there in my “top 10” if I ever wished to enumerate one. But in both [Human Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0815341857/geneexpressio-20), a textbook, and [A Genetic and Cultural Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231133960/geneexpressio-20), a biography of L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, it was noted that the PCA **maps** pioneered in [History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20) have never really caught on. There might be a reason…[Interpreting principal component analyses of spatial population genetic variation](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.139.html):

> Nearly 30 years ago, Cavalli-Sforza et al. pioneered the use of > principal component analysis (PCA) in population genetics and used PCA > to produce maps summarizing human genetic variation across continental > regions…They interpreted gradient and wave patterns in these maps as > signatures of specific migration events…These interpretations have > been controversial…but influential…and the use of PCA has become > widespread in analysis of population genetics data…However, the > behavior of PCA for genetic data showing continuous spatial variation, > such as might exist within human continental groups, has been less > well characterized. **Here, we find that gradients and waves observed > in Cavalli-Sforza et al.’s maps resemble sinusoidal mathematical > *artifacts* that arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data, > implying that the patterns do not necessarily reflect specific migration events.** Our findings aid interpretation of PCA results and suggest how PCA can help correct for continuous population structure in association studies.

If this critique holds up, it’s a step back for the synthesis of genetics & history. But so it goes. Science is fundamentally about proper method, not congenial outcome. [G](https://popgen-ramblings.blogspot.com/2008/04/sines-of-expansion.html) &
[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/picture-is-worth-thousand-words-part-n.php) comment futher. G’s point is important to keep in mind:

> …These results do not to say that human populations did not expand out > of particular regions, just that PCA maps are not the best tool to judge this. **The authors also note that this does not invalidate the use of PCA to correct for structure in association studies**, and in fact might aid in their interpretation in epidemiological models.
