Why you might have asthma?

[Effect of Variation in *CHI3L1* on Serum YKL-40 Level, Risk of Asthma, and Lung Function](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/NEJMoa0708801?resourcetype=HWCIT):

From the discussion:

Identifying the remaining loci that contribute to > differences in serum YKL-40 levels and related proteins could identify > additional genes with a significant effect on the risk of asthma and > on lung function….

Remember that the [Hutterites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite) are a relatively homogenous population; and that’s one reason that these researchers selected them. And of course the variance in serum levels of YKL-40 does not track perfectly the expression of the asthma disease phenotype. In other words, **this is possibly a locus of some significance, but the polygenic nature of this disease susceptibility is simply confirmed**. It is also important to add that it seems likely that though asthma is heritable (there are genetic predispositions), its expression seems highly contingent upon the environment. That being said, the paper does attempt to connect the dots in terms of using various techniques to converge upon a plausible answer to their question.  
Finally, I was curious about the [SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=4950928) which these researchers implicated in terms of increasing risk of developing asthma. It seems that Africans have more diversity around this region, so one might wonder if some between population differences exist in terms of susceptibility. Specifically, on [the candidate SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=4950928) the asthma-susceptible variant is twice as common in the Yoruba sample as it is in Asians and Europeans.
