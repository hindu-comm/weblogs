The Inner Asian gap: the Afanasievo breakthrough

If you read this weblog you are aware that I have a fascination with the intersection of human history and human evolutionary genetics. There are many questions I have about the [finding](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=convergent+skin+color+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) from evolutionary genomic studies that light skin evolved at least twice independently in Eurasia within the last 20,000 years or so at the extremities. The selection coefficients are large, so I am confused as to why even minimal gene flow did not result in equilibration and homogenization of the allelic profiles of the populations. I have posited that the answer has to do with very low population densities verging upon nil in Central Asia. From [The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691058873/geneexpressio-20) (**a book I can not recommend enough!**):

> Cemeteries of the local Kuznetsk-Altai foragers like Lebedii II were > located in the forest and forest-meadow zone higher up on the slopes > of the Altai….

It seems that around 3500 BCE they “leap-frogged” across what would become the northern Kazakh steppe for the pine forests of south Siberian fringe. The point though is this: **this sort of volkswanderung only became possible with the emergence of the nomadic herder lifestyle.** The selective sweeps which one infers from evolutionary studies likely occurred before the Afanasievo trek….
