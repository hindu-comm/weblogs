Your genome is what you eat?

This is a *very* interdisciplinary paper; props to the authors for that. Recent methods from evolutionary genomics, primatology, older molecular evolutionary techniques, a basic exposition of the physiological genetics of dentition and a broader palaeoanthropological framework were all tossed together to synthesize an explanatory narrative. Impressive, if a bit unfamiliar territory now and then.

  
Using the [Tajima’s D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajima%27s_D) method of [detecting natural selection](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2006/01/detecting_natural_selection_pa_1.php) on about a dozen human populations the authors discovered that in regards to the *ENAM* locus non-African populations were fixed for a derived variant. Either this was due to a bottleneck during the Out-of-Africa event, or, it was the result of a selective sweep driven by new environmental conditions. Additionally, they used simulations with various demographic parameters to infer the greater plausibility of the hypothesis of positive selection as opposed to population history driven increases in allele frequency (bottlenecks sampling wildly upward the proportion, etc.). The fact that the derived variant also exhibits a nonsynonymous substitution suggests that there is a functional signficance to the change. To compelement this observation the he authors attempt sketch out with a rudimentary hypothesis for how the molecular genetic pathways could cause a change in the development of enamel. They also observe that Africans have thicker enamel than non-Africans, so that the genetic difference between Africans & non-Africans might be causal specifically in terms of this phenotype. Finally the paper also compared [orthologous](http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-O/orthologous_genes.html) genomic regions in other primates; they wanted to get a bigger picture of the macroevolutionary history around *ENAM* via its non-human cognates. And what they found suggests **a great deal of adaptation leading up to the human lineage (excess nonsynonymous substitutions) as well variation of phenotype which tracked diet.** The authors conclude:

> These data suggest that tooth enamel in non- African populations may > be adaptively thinning to account for changing diets in the > out-of-Africa expansion. Our hypothesis is that the nonsynonymous > polymorphism alters the molecular function of *enamelin*, resulting in > a change in enamel thickness. *enamelin* **provides an opportunity to > look for an association between genotype and enamel thickness > phenotype** in human populations and to understand the role of > adaptive evolution in creating human phenotypic diversity….

The next step is to do an assocation study in African Americans; they’d have the right mix of polymorphisms to see if the variation on *ENAM* really is what is causing the differences of enamel thickness. But what about their overall hypothesis? I’m looking at this through a [recent human evolutionary lens](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=recent+human+evolution+papers+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search). These sorts of papers don’t exist in a vacuum. Results on [amylase](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=amylase+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search), [*LCT*](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=LCT+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) and ADH prime us to anticipate diet related evolution. **Food affects fitness; a lot.**  
This paper has a somewhat primatological focus; ergo, the reference to [frugivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore), [folivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folivore) and omnivores. I’m not sure that the difference in Eurasia (as opposed to Africa) had that much to do with content of food. Rather, it might have had more to do with presentation and processing. [Breads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread#History_of_bread) and gruels must have shown up soon after agriculture. We know that with agriculture peoples got smaller, more gracile, and their teeth shrunk. Why shouldn’t enamel have become less robust as well?  
Below is Figure 2 from the paper. The font is small, so all you need to know is that rows are individuals, who are geographically clustered (so “SS” represents Sub-Saharan Africans), and the columns the sections of the genome. Changes in color represent changes in state.
