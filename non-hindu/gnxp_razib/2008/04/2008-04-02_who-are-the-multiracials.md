Who are the multiracials?

A few days ago *The New York Times* published an article, [Who Are We? New Dialogue on Mixed Race](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/us/politics/31race.html?sq=Multiracial&st=nyt&scp=1&pagewanted=all). Who are the multiracials? Because of the history of black-white relations in the United States, and Barack Obama’s own background, the term is often framed so that that dimension is front & center. But what do the numbers say? [Census 2000](http://www.censusscope.org/us/chart_multi.html) found that 2.4% of Americans selected more than one race; i.e., they identified as multiracial. The [breakdowns were](http://www.censusscope.org/us/chart_multi.html):

|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Rank** | **Multiple Race Selection**       | **% of Total Pop.** | **% of Multiracials** |

| *3.*     | White × Asian                     | 0.31%               | 12.72%                |
| *4.*     | White × Black                     | 0.28%               | 11.50%                |

![mixedrace.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/mixedrace.jpg?resize=199%2C377)![mixedrace.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/mixedrace.jpg?resize=199%2C377)“Some Other Race” usually means [Hispanic or Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(United_States_Census)#Ethnicity) (nearly half of Hispanics or Latinos identify as white, but 2/5^(ths) identify as Some Other Race). When it comes to [how race is lived in America](http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/race/) the fact that the major media is based out of the east coast has a distortionary affect on the discourse. Granted, *The New York Times* piece profiled a woman of mixed Chinese & white heritage, but she was predictably tacked on after the primary focus on the new *bi*racial America.  
**P.S.** Did you know that Herbert Hoover’s Vice President, [Charles Curtis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Curtis), was about 1/4^(th) to 1/2^(th) Native American (depending on which source you trust) and spent some of his youth on a reservation?
