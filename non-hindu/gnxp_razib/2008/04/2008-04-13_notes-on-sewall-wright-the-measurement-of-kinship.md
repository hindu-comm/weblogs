Notes on Sewall Wright: the Measurement of Kinship

David Burbridge continues his awesome [series](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/03/on-reading-wright.php) of [posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/notes-on-sewall-wright-path-analysis.php) on the history of evolutionary genetic thought with [Notes on Sewall Wright: the Measurement of Kinship](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/04/notes-on-sewall-wright-measurement-of.php). Here’s a taste:

> In Malecot’s system two genes at the same locus, in the same or > different individuals, are defined as Identical by Descent (IBD) if > they are both descended from the very same individual ancestral gene, > without either of them undergoing mutation in the interim. The > relatedness between two individuals can be measured, roughly speaking, > by calculating the probability that two genes at the same locus in the > two individuals are IBD. To do this it is necessary first to identify > all the distinct paths of descent connecting the two individuals > through a common ancestor, and then to calculate the probability that > the same gene will have descended to both individuals from that > ancestor along any given path. Since all such paths of descent are > mutually exclusive (though portions of them may overlap), the > resulting probabilities can be added together to give the total > probability that a given gene in the two individuals is IBD. To take a > simple case, consider two individuals (full siblings) who have both > parents in common. I assume that the parents are not related to each > other or inbred. If we select a (diploid autosomal) gene at random > from one sibling, there is a probability of one-half that it comes > from the mother, and, if it does, a probability of one-half that the > same gene has descended from the mother to the other sibling. This > gives a compound probability of one-quarter that the second sibling > has received a gene from the mother that is IBD to the selected gene > in the first sibling. There is likewise a probability of one-quarter > that the second sibling has received an IBD copy from the father. The > total probability is therefore one-half, which is often called the > Coefficient of Relationship or Relatedness between full siblings. If > the parents are themselves related or inbred (i.e. descended from one > of their own ancestors by more than one possible path), additional > paths of descent need to be taken into account. Since there are two > genes at the relevant locus in the second sibling, there is a > probability of one-quarter (one-half times one-half) that a particular > one of these genes, chosen at random, is IBD to the selected gene in > the first sibling. This is usually known as their Coefficient of > Kinship. If a male and female with a non-zero Coefficient of Kinship > mate together, there is a non-zero probability that any offspring will inherit two genes that are IBD to each other. This is usually known as the offspring’s Coefficient of Inbreeding, and a little consideration shows that it is equal to the Coefficient of Kinship of the parents.
