Japanese Giant Hornet blitzkrieg

If you like bees, perhaps you don’t want to click this video….

The [native honey bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet#Native_honey_bees) have evolved defensive tactics. Guess it goes to show that kin selectively driven altruism doesn’t matter for jack shit unless you actually have some proximate tactics to go along with the strategic good intentions. Sometimes we could learn from nature’s lessons….

**Update:** Counter-attack! Bee-day!
