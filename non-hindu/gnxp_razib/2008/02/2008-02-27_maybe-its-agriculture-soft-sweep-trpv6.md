Maybe it’s agriculture – soft sweep TRPV6

[Parallel Selection on *TRPV6* in Human Populations](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001686) (Open Access):

I would bet many Old World “hunter-gatherer” populations in close proximity to the *Oikumene* were driven there, or, gene flow has swamped out any “pure” original signature. In any case, the paper is basically talking about the process whereby extant genetic variation that was always around got selected due to changes in the exogenous pressures. So a switch to a new lifestyle. In contrast, the locus around *LCT* that’s swept in much of Eurasia seems to be derived from a relatively recent mutant.
