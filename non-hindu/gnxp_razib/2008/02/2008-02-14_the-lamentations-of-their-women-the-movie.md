The lamentations of their women – the movie?

Roger L. Simon [reviews](http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2008/02/sergeis_mongoli.php) a new Russian film, [Mongol](http://www.mongolmovie.com/), which is a biopic of Genghis Khan. See the [trailer](http://www.mongolmovie.com/trailer.html). If you want a fictionalized, but relatively accurate, narrative of Genghis Khan’s tale I suggest Pamela Sargent’s [Ruler Of The Sky](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=2&sts=t&tn=ruler+of+the+sky&x=0&y=0) (Sargent extrapolates into the blank spaces of his life to fill out the story, as opposed to making things up to add “spice” in contradiction to the spirit of what we know). Why post about this on a weblog generally science-focused? [The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=12592608):

Certainly a way to make population genetics interesting to a particular subset. In [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609610627//geneexpressio-20) the author argues that the world conqueror’s success was in large part owed to the fact that he marginalized his extended family and promoted an inner circle of loyalists on the merit of their talents (e.g., [Subutai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subutai)). But subsequently to this first generation direct line descent from Genghis Khan became the “gold standard” across much of Eurasia for who could ascend to power; ergo, the inference by some population geneticists that the Mongolian modal haplotype derives from Genghis Khan.
