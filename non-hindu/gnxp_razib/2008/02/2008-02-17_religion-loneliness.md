Religion & loneliness

[God (and Gadgets) of the Lonely?](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2008/02/god_and_gadgets_of_the_lonely.php):

> I’ve been hanging out with fellow atheists for a while now, and one of > the more common discussions I’ve had when the topic of religion comes > up is, why are people religious? The two most common answers I’ve > heard from atheist friends and acquaintances are that religion is a > fantasy designed to explain the mysterious and otherwise > unexplainable, and that religion is a fantasy designed to make people > feel less alone in the universe. As those of you who’ve been reading > Mixing Memory for a while may have noticed, these discussions have led > me to be somewhat obsessed with understanding the psychological > origins of religion. While the final answer to why people are > religious is a long, long way off, I can say with some confidence that > the first of the two answers above is almost certainly wrong. People’s > religious impulses stem from much more mundane sources than the > mysteriousness of the world around us. That’s not to say that religion > can’t serve to help explain the otherwise inexplicable, or that this > isn’t an important purpose of religion, but it doesn’t seem to be one > of the fundamental or original purposes of it. Instead, it seems that > religion’s social functions are actually more foundational. This leads > to the second answer above — the one that says religion is around to > make us feel less lonely — seeming plausible. Most of the research on > the social aspects of religion to date, however, has been on its > function in communities. A paper in this month’s issue of > Psychological Science, however, takes a more direct look at the role > of loneliness in religion.
