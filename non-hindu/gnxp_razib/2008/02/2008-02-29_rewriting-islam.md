Rewriting Islam

Lots of [articles](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7264903.stm) on [the radical reinterpretation](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7264903.stm) of the [Hadith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith) in Turkey. The Hadith serve as the basis for Islamic law, and orthopraxy more generally. I am on the record as saying that texts don’t in the end determine anything, so obviously I’m skeptical. But, I will simply point to a historical analogy; in the 19th century [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt#Industrialization_and_modernization) and Japan attempted to modernize and catch-up with Western nations. Egypt did not truly succeed, Japan did. Where there’s a will there always isn’t a way; Japan had the necessary preconditions in terms of human capital for the task at hand (e.g., high literacy, a preexistent samizdat of “Dutch” learning, etc.), Egypt did not. A revision of the Hadith is a positive sign, and it is a necessary precondition toward modernity in a Western manner (for example, in regards to sexual equality in family law, or a full-throated acceptance of the institutional instruments modern of capitalism¹), but I doubt it is sufficient. A genuine reinterpretation of Islam will more likely happen in a place like the United States, where there are endogenous social forces at work at the grassroots. **Textual reintrepretation of sacred literature or law is more often concomitant with, or the effect of, change, not the agent of it.** Feminist or socialist interpretations of the Bible post-date the emergence of these movements, they did not inspire them.  
1 – “Islamic banking” actually goes a long way toward this already by making up excuses and “work-arounds” which violate the spirit but follow the letter of the law. Rather, I think it is in family law where a top-down imposition might be more necessary.
