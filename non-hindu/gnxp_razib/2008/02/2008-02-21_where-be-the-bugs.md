Where be the bugs?

Cool paper in Nature, [Global trends in emerging infectious diseases](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/abs/nature06536.html). Not cool because infectious diseases are great, but I believe they’ve been (and are) major evolutionary pressures on our species. [Great map](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/fig_tab/nature06536_F3.html#figure-title) too. From the legend:

a\) zoonotic pathogens from wildlife  
b) zoonotic pathogens from non-wildlife  
c) drug-resistant pathogens  
d) vector-borne pathogens

Not surprised about the intersection with [world population density](http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/earth/images/final-images/g-gpw-population-map.gif). Just by inspection, the Indo-Gangetic plain looks to be the “winner” here! Though it does seem that Sub-Saharan Africa holds its own in terms of representing above its population-weight class in the wild-life derived and vector-born pathogen categories. Might we be able to chalk that up to a long history of coevolution between the African ecosystem and hominid species? Domesticated animals seem to be more of an issue in the old Eurasian *Oikumene* as you would expect. For more precision on the global trends and correlates, [check out their regressions](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/fig_tab/nature06536_T1.html#figure-title).
