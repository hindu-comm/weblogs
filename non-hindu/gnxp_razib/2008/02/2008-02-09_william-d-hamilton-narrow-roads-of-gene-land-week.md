William D. Hamilton & Narrow Roads of Gene Land week

If you don’t know, I’ve been reviewing William D. Hamilton’s [Narrow Roads of Gene Land](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716745305/geneexpressio-20) the past week [over at my other blog](https://www.google.com/search?q=william+d.+hamilton&btnG=Search%21&domains=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp&sitesearch=scienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp). The papers I blogged were [The genetical evolution of social behaviour – I](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_genetical_evolution_of_soc.php) &
[II](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_genetical_evolution_of_soc_1.php), [The moulding of senescence by natural selection](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_genetical_evolution_of_soc_1.php), [Extraordinary sex ratios](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/extraordinary_sex_ratios.php) and [Innate social aptitudes of man](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/innate_social_aptitudes_of_man.php). In [The Altruism Equation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691125902/geneexpressio-20) Lee Alan Dugatkin notes that it’s rather obvious that in the scientific literature the citation for many of Hamilton’s two papers where he outlined the nature of [inclusive fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_fitness) were blindly based on the verbal summary in [Sociobiology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674002350/geneexpressio-20) and [The Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192860925/geneexpressio-20); errors in the bibliographies of both books are replicated in a substantial portion of the cites after 1975. That’s pretty sad; we’re not talking [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity) theory here. I encourage all readers interested in evolution & behavior to check out Hamilton’s work in the original.
