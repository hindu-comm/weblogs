More pathogens means more collectivism?

[Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/70268021u2vh1356/) (Open Access):

> …We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of collectivism > (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the transmission of > pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with > individualism) will more often characterize cultures in regions that > have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on > epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide cross-national > surveys of individualism/collectivism, our results support this > hypothesis: the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive > correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong > negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain > significant even when controlling for potential confounding variables. > These results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of human societies.

The, [*r*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation#The_sample_correlation) = -0.69 at *p-*value 0.001 and n = 68. You can find the raw data here. It would be cool to see trends within nations/societies. For example, variation in altitude.
