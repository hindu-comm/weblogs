The Structure of Evolutionary Theory blogging

As you probably know at my other [weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/) I’ve been going through Stephen Jay Gould’s [The Structure of Evolutionary Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006135/geneexpressio-20) chapter by chapter. I just finished the first part of the work, which is a history of science as opposed to a discussion of contemporary science. I’ve blogged chapter [1](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/the_structure_of_evolutionary.php), [2](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/the_structure_of_evolutionary_1.php), [3](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/the_structure_of_evolutionary_3.php), [4](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_structure_of_evolutionary_4.php), [5](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_structure_of_evolutionary_6.php), [6](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_structure_of_evolutionary_7.php) and [7](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/02/the_structure_of_evolutionary_8.php) so far. If you’re interested in the topics covered by Gould so far I recommend [Peter J. Bowler](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/105-1198214-4902856?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=peter+j.+bowler&x=0&y=0) and [Will Provine](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/105-1198214-4902856?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=william+b.+provine&x=0&y=0). Bowler is a lot more concise about 19th century evolutionary theory, in part because that’s his academic specialty. Provine offers a [Sewall Wright-centric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright) perspective, but that’s a good starting point to get a sense of the arc of 20th century evolutionary biology.
