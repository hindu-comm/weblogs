Robert J. Samuelson is not an economist (Paul A. Samuelson is)

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/2sams-737074.jpg)This is a post for Google. A post I wish had been there for me during my periods of confusion on this topic. I notice that Chris Roach [recently referred](http://mansizedtarget.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/obamas-lame-policies/) to [Robert J. Samuelson](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/opinions/samuelson.htm) as a “Respected economist.” He isn’t. Robert J. Samuelson is a financial and economic journalist. He has bachelor’s degree in government from Harvard, so one assumes he has taken an economics course or two or three. Samuelson has a column in Newsweek which often focuses on economics; this means that he is a major public figure in this area. I had assumed that Robert J. Samuelson was a prominent economist who was moonlighting as a journalist until a few years ago when I was curious if he was related to Larry Summers. I knew Summers was related to an economist with the last name Samuelson. I think this is a reason that people assume that Robert J. Samuelson is an economist. [Paul A. Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson) is obviously an economist, to some extent the economist of the 20th century (along with Kenneth Arrow and a few others). When I didn’t know anything about economics I too believed that Robert J. Samuelson was an economist partly because I vaguely knew Paul A. Samuelson was the economist, which says a lot about how eminent Paul A. Samuelson must be if I had any awareness of the man!
