85% of genetic variation is within groups…

…yes, true. On a typical single locus (on some loci, such as [SLC24A5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLC24A5), most of the variation is between groups). But that doesn’t mean that you can’t use genetics to differentiate population clusters. Here are 938 individuals (the points) from [51 world populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Diversity_Project#Current_status) (the color of the points) displayed on a figure with the two largest [principle components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_component_analysis) of the variation.
