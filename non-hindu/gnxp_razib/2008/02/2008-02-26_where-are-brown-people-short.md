Where are brown people short?

In the comments to my post, Why brown people are midgets, a reader pointed me to [this paper](http://business.flinders.edu.au/research/heights/5%20Variation%20I%20Height.pdf), which tabulates and analyzes some data from the 1960s for males. There isn’t anything too surprising in the data set; Punjabis are tall compared to non-Punjabis, higher castes are taller than lower castes. There is **a lot** of unaccounted for variation. This was before [Indian Shining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Shining), and the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_revolution#Indian_success) probably hadn’t sunk in yet (I wouldn’t be surprised if the between-state differences increased, while the between-caste differences decreased, in the past 40 years). So appropriate caveats. The one surprising thing is that being a Muslim was a variable that predicted more height! This is correcting for regional distribution. The reason it’s surprising is that Muslims are genetically no different from non-Muslims (e.g., in Uttar Pradesh the highest proportion of recent West Asian ancestry is 5% across the whole population) and tend to socially disadvantaged in India (i.e., they are a [Backward Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_class)). The only explanation I have is that Muslims are less likely to be vegetarian or have dietary taboos which constrain their nutritional choices. Tables below the fold….
