Neurogenomics and genetic interactions

Two PNAS papers today that caught my eye, going to read for later, [Distinct genomic signatures of adaptation in pre- and postnatal environments during human evolution](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0712400105v1?rss=1) and [Defining genetic interaction](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0712255105v1?rss=1). Both Open Access.
