Science blogs, what are they good for?

John Hawks as a [long post](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/2008/02/28#scienc-blogging-for-its-own-sake-2008) on the [kerfuffle](http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/02/and_the_wtf_of_the_week_award.php) over “good” science blogging. I think John is right to emphasize the importance of search engine traffic for “specialist” posts; there’s a significant [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail) effect here.
