Snorg Tees Girl

A story about [Alice Fraasa](http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080112/NEWS01/80112066) the [Snorg Tees](http://www.snorgtees.com/) girl. I’ve been bombarded on The New York Times website with the ads all week and I clicked. I assume that it has ads all the time, but hell if I could tell you what they were about, I don’t notice them. Until this week. Other people must have clicked too, the Snorg Tees link was down. Assume this is a new ad buy and their network engineers weren’t ready for the increase in traffic….
