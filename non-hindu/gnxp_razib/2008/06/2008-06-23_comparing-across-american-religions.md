Comparing across American religions

The Pew [US Religious Landscape Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/comparisons) has come out with its second week of survey results, now focusing in more detail on the beliefs of various groups. Nice way to compare across groups. I’ve collected and reformatted a selection of responses and their frequencies for four groups, Evangelicals (excluding Historically Black Churches), Mainline Protestants, Catholics and Muslims. I havd argued before that the [median religious beliefs](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/03/visualizing-distribution.php) of American Muslims are closer to Evangelical Christians than to the religious as a whole. Therefore, one has to be careful when comparing “moderate Christians” to “moderate Muslims,” since the former is likely to have far more liberal religious and social beliefs than the latter, though they might be appropriately termed so in the spectrum of their tradition. The results seem to suggest that I was mostly right; though American Muslims are somewhat less conservative than Evangelicals. Interestingly, note that Roman Catholics and Mainline Protestants are hard to distinguish.

(Caution: don’t read that much into the percentages on the margins. 6% of atheists and 14% of agnostics [believe in a Personal God](https://religions.pewforum.org/reports) according to the survey! Also, readers will probably be [interested in the detailed tables](https://religions.pewforum.org/reports#) which breakdown by denominations)
