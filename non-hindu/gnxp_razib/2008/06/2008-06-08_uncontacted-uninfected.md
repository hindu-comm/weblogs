Uncontacted, uninfected?

[Twilight for the Forest People](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/weekinreview/08wilford.html):

> If they are removed and **survive the exposure to diseases they have never encountered**, it is likely that the unique knowledge and beliefs that define them, the spirit of their life, will probably slip away.

I am to understand that governments like Brazil are better about this, but there has long been a problem with these tribal groups disappearing in 2-3 generations because of their lack of immune faculties to deal with the pathogens theyâ€™re newly exposed to. Something to think about.
