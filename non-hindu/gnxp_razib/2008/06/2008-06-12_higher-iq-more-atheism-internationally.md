Higher IQ ~ more atheism internationally

[God makes you stupid, researchers claim](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/12/god_boffins/):

> **Lynn and his two co-authors argue that average IQ is an excellent > predictor of what proportion of the population are true believers, > across 137 countries.** They also cite surveys of the US Academy of > Sciences and UK Royal Academy showing single-digit rates of religious > belief among academics.

Well, I actually [blogged this relationship](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001523.html) years ago (December 2003 actually). It jumps out at you pretty clearly if you know the two traits and their international trends. I think that the causal factors which underly the relationship need to be qualified carefully; I do not believe that it is *just* high IQ leading to some inevitable skepticism. I think a psychological phenomenon such as religious belief should be modeled as a quantitative trait subject to a norm of reaction. So of late I’ve become more interested in the correlations of these traits which vary *within* a culture. I’m especially interested in the \~0.50 heritability that Thomas Bouchard found among twins separated at birth in regards to religious intensity….  
I’ve placed the three tables I found in a pre-press form of the paper that is circulating below the fold….

  
**Table 1. Decline in percentage holding religious belief, with age (Francis,1989)**

|       |     |        |         |
|-------|-----|--------|---------|
| *Age* | *N* | *Boys* | *Girls* |
| 5-6   | 400 | 87.9   | 96.0    |
| 11-12 | 400 | 79.6   | 84.1    |
| 15-16 | 400 | 55.7   | 70.4    |

**Table 2. Declining belief Correlates with Age (sd =15.6)(Turner,1980)**

|       |     |                |                      |
|-------|-----|----------------|----------------------|
| *Age* | *N* | *Belief* *(%)* | *R: Non-belief x IQ* |
| 12    | 50  |  69.54        |  0.183              |
| 13    | 50  |  66.10        |  0.110              |
| 14    | 50  |  59.86        | -0.113               |
| 15    | 50  |  57.94        | -0.354\*             |

**Table 3. Correlations between the National IQs and Religious Disbelief**

|        |               |                 |                       |                      |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| *IQs*  | *N.Countries* | *Non-Believers* | *Range Non-Believers* | *R: Non-belief x IQ* |
| 64-108 | 137          | 10.69%         | \<1% to 81%          | +0.60                |
| 64-86  |  69          |  1.95%         | \<1% to 40%          | +0.16               |
| 87-108 |  68         | 16.99%         | \<1% to 81%          | +0.54               |
