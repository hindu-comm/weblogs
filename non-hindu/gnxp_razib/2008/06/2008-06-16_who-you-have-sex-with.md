Who you have sex with….

[Genetic and Environmental Effects on Same-sex Sexual Behavior: A Population Study of Twins in Sweden](http://www.springerlink.com/content/2263646523551487/):

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080616101119.htm) has an important caveat:

In plain language these results suggest that the largest proportion of the variance within the population for this trait (same sex orientation) can not be accounted for by variation in genes or shared family outlook/experiences. They also shouldn’t be surprising, Judith Rich Harris has written two books, [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20) and [No Two Alike](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393059480/geneexpressio-20/102-9239820-5488135), attempting to explain the “non-shared environmental” aspect of variance which pops up in behavior genetic studies (the breakdown is often on the order of 50% genetic, 10% shared environment, and 40% non-shared environment). Do note that that component of variance may still have biological underpinnings; e.g., an environmental shock during the prenatal stage which changes the path of development. Finally, I do think it is intriguing that females show a much larger contribution of shared environment. To me this dovetails with the anecdotal observation that facultative homosexual behavior is more common among females than males, especially when you exclude extreme situations such as imprisonment or living in Saudi Arabia.
