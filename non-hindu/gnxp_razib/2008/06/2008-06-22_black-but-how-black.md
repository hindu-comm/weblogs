Black, but how black?

[Comparing Genetic Ancestry and Self-Described Race in African Americans Born in the United States and in Africa](http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/6/1329) (H/T [Yann](https://yannklimentidis.blogspot.com/2008/06/using-self-report-information-to.html)):

So how does this jive with [Genetic Structure, Self-Identified Race/Ethnicity, and Confounding in Case-Control Association Studies](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1196372):

In a word: psychology. The identity of African Americans is socially constructed, and their own self-perceptions in terms of their ancestral origin are confounded by the vicissitudes of history as well as cultural context. Unfortunately there then tends to be an assumption by some that the malleability of the social dimensions of racial identity perfectly reflect the nature of the underlying population substructure. Obviously they do, but not with perfect correlation, rather, genetic structure is one of the background conditions which strongly shapes social realities.  
In the American context the nature of hypodescent is critical, since one drop of black blood rendered an individual black in the eyes of white Americans the effect of within group variation in the extent of European ancestry was not as explicit or notable as in other societies where grades of admixture were acknowledged. In South Africa for example populations of mixed white and black ancestry are distinguished from both parental populations, and had social status equidistant. Though the black elite has traditionally been lighter skinned and presumably more European in ancestry than the majority of the population, one presumes that the power of phenotype as opposed to genealogy was paramount (genealogy being a sketchy affair due to the nature of the period of slavery). In a randomly mating population the association of ancestry with perceived appearance will weaken because the latter is strongly weighted to a few traits which might be coded by a few genes which exhibit a great deal of within family variance. The black American population was not randomly mating (e.g., “the talented tenth” was always a self-conscious subgroup), but it was not perfectly assorted by ancestry or class either.  
The point is that one should take all priors into account in terms of shaping a picture of reality. As noted in the paper above the reason to ascertain the extent of admixture and its variance within a population are eminently pragmatic; population substructure is medically useful information. The nature of that substructure may manifest on a genetic level, but it is often shaped and constrained by exogenous sociological parameters. And obviously this doesn’t apply just to African Americans. Here’s a figure from a paper I recently blogged about the genetic structure of of Ashkenazi Jews and Northern Europeans:

See the Askhenazi Jews who are outside of the tight central cluster? I bet you that these probably wouldn’t be able to explain to you why this might be….
