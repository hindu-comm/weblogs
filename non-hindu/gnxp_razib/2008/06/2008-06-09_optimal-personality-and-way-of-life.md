Optimal personality and way of life

**Update:** Here’s the paper, [Dopamine receptor genetic polymorphisms and body composition in undernourished pastoralists: An exploration of nutrition indices among nomadic and recently settled Ariaal men of northern Kenya](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/173/abstract). I’ve put the most relevant figure below the fold.

[Is ADHD An Advantage For Nomadic Tribesmen?](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080609195604.htm):

> While those with the DRD4/7R allele were better nourished in the > nomadic population, they were less well-nourished in the settled > population. Although the effects of different versions of dopamine > genes have already been studied in industrialized countries, very > little research has been carried out in non-industrial, subsistence > environments like the areas where the Ariaal live, despite the fact > that such environments may be more similar to the environments where > much of human genetic evolution took place.

6 years ago, [In our genes](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/1/10):

> Our hypothesis suggests that the absence of 7R in East Asia is recent, > consequent to the establishment of powerful polities that allowed > population growth and forced agricultural intensification. It is of > interest in this context that 2R alleles in China are probably derived > from 7R alleles by recombination, suggesting that the loss of 7R is > indeed recent. >
> Besides lowland South America, another well known region with local > anarchy and female farming is highland New Guinea. Our model of the > dynamics of 7R predict that the frequency is very high in those > populations. Because they have been there for tens of thousands of > years and they have not moved, the Chen et al. (2) model predicts a > low frequency of 7R there. This is a natural test to distinguish the > two hypotheses. A 7R frequency of 0.25 was reported (2) for a sample > from New Guinea, but it is not reported even in the original source of > the data whether it was from a highland or coastal population. >
> In some societies 7R allele may lower fitness even when rare, as is > probably the case in East Asia and among the !Kung Bushmen. In such > populations it would stay rare even in the presence of gene flow from > neighboring populations, even from neighbors with a social system that > favors 7R alleles. Neutral genes would show no sharp boundary between > the two populations, whereas alleles affecting behavior should show a > sharp spatial gradient. This is likely to be the case with the 7R > allele because some adjacent populations have very different 7R > frequencies.

Here’s a [map which shows some geographic variation](http://www.genome.uci.edu/images/WorldMap_DRD4Alleles.jpg) for the 7R repeat.
