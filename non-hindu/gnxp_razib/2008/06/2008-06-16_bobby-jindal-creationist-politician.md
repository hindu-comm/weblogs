> As a parent, when my kids go to schools, when they go to public > schools, I want them to be presented with the best thinking. I want > them to be able to make decisions for themselves. I want them to see > the best data. I personally think that the life, human life and the > world we live in wasn’t created accidentally. I do think that there’s > a creator. I’m a Christian. I do think that God played a role in > creating not only earth, but mankind. Now, the way that he did it, I’d > certainly want my kids to be exposed to the very best science. I don’t > want them to be – I don’t want any facts or theories or explanations > to be withheld from them because of political correctness. The way > we’re going to have smart, intelligent kids is exposing them to the > very best science and let them not only decide, but also let them > contribute to that body of knowledge. That’s what makes the scientific > process so exciting. You get to go there and find facts and data and > test what’s come before you and challenge those theories.
