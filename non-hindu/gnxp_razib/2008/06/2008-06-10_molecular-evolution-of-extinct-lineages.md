Molecular evolution of extinct lineages

This is cool, [Intraspecific phylogenetic analysis of Siberian woolly mammoths using complete mitochondrial genomes](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0802315105v1?rss=1):

Sympatric just means there was a spatial overlap between the lineages (see Figure 1 in the paper). I don’t particular care much about the specific inferences being made here; I just think it’s really cool that this sort of work can be performed on an extinct lineage of organisms. Of course, mammoth and mtDNA are optimal targets for this sort of research. Mammoth are big, widespread and were extant across a region where there is a high likelihood of preservation (low temperatures and permafrost), while mtDNA is relatively copious and so a greater likelihood exists of usable quantities remaining even after eons of degradation. But ultimately time is probably the biggest factor, mammoth were around relatively recently in terms of natural historical scales.
