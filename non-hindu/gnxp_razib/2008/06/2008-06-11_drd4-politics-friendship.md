DRD4, politics & friendship

[Dan](http://www.tdaxp.com/archive/2008/06/10/the-genetics-of-human-social-behavior-and-its-implications-for-the-peace.html) points me to this [working paper](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/friends_drd4_and_political_ideology.pdf), [Friendships Moderate an Association Between the DRD4 Gene and Political Ideology](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/friends_drd4_and_political_ideology.pdf):

> Studies of identical and fraternal twins suggest that [political > ideology has a heritable > component](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/004096.html)…but no > specific gene associated with…political ideology has so far been > identified. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of > Adolescent Health, we investigate the moderating influence of > friendships on the contribution of the 7R allele of the DRD4 gene to > liberal political ideology. The number of self-nominated friendships > in adolescence moderates the influence of the gene on political > ideology; the more friends nominated, the stronger the liberal ideological identification of the respondent in early adulthood. This is the first study to elaborate a specific gene-environment interaction that contributes to ideological self-identification.
