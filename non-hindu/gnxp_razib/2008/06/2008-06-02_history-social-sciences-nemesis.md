History, social science’s nemesis?

A week ago I posted on the gender gap in politics; today [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/06/men_women_and_p.html) critiques a similar argument:

History is good for you. Really. It increases the sample space from which you can select data. You want to test your hypotheses on different populations, but let’s include the dimension of time as well as space.
