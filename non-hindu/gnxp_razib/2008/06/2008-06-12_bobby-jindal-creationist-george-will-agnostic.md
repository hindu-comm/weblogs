Bobby Jindal, Creationist? George Will, agnostic

[Josh](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2008/06/louisiana_house_approves_creat.php) has a good [overview](http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2008/06/louisiana_house_approves_creat.php) of the wending through the legislature of a Creationist bill in Louisiana. The governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, who [just turned 37](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/005244.html), has made Creationist noises before. This is interesting because Jindal is a Roman Catholic, so he has no necessary religious rationale for his Creationism. Additionally, he has a degree in biology from Brown University. Fellow ScienceBlogger [Mike](http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2007/11/why_is_bobby_jindal_devaluing.php) happens to have gone through the same biology program as Jindal at the same time at Brown, and he makes it clear that Jindal’s opinions do not emerge from a vacuum of information, Brown’s curriculum was very thorough about emphasizing evolution. If Jindal does sign this bill I believe he will be have to make his mark as governor of Louisiana as opposed to being a national figure; evolution is a marginal issue to most people but cultural elites, both Left and Right, perceive anti-evolutionism as a sure sign of yokel-identification.

  
On a slightly different note, the prominent conservative public intellectual George Will recently admitted to [being an agnostic](http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=171135) on the [Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=171135). Will’s rather forceful and uncompromising opposition to [Intelligent Design](http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p90.htm) comes into somewhat sharper focus now I would think. He’s out promoting his new book, [One Man’s America: The Pleasures and Provocations of Our Singular Nation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307407861/geneexpressio-20), and I’ve noticed Will has referred to the empirical nature of conservatism several times. I found that interesting since [Heather Mac Donald](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/10-questions-for-heather-mac-donald.php), a conservative who has not been quiet about her atheism, has also emphasized the importance of empiricism in shaping her outlook. I do know that Heather and George Will are on good terms, so perhaps there are outlines of a Vast Right-Wing Atheist Conspiracy???
