Soda vs. Pop (and Coke)

The post on soft drink terms has elicited a great deal of response (on my [other blog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/soda-vs-pop-explanations.php) [as well](http://www.haloscan.com/comments/raldanash/2605725564955778004?url=http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/soda-vs-pop-explanations.php&thetime=6/15/2008%2004:44:00%20PM)). Many people want a little more granularity; well, it was brought to my attention that [Google Maps based survey is up](http://www.chrismore.com/sodapop/). [You can vote](http://www.chrismore.com/sodapop/submit.cfm) and increase the *N*. I ask all American readers interested in the topic to participate (doesn’t look like it takes Postal Codes, only Zips), as it will offer us even more detail. My “blog reader surveys” usually return around 400 responses so I hope I can increase the sample size multiplicatively….
