Google and cognition

In *The Atlantic* [Is Google Making Us Stupid?](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/200807/google). I am obviously more positive about Google than the author of this piece; e.g., I happen to believe that “The human brain is just an outdated computer that needs a faster processor and a bigger hard drive.” Additionally, I think focusing on Google is too narrow, Wikipedia for example has definitely caused some issues with me in terms of reading academic works and always wanting “links” within the text so that I get some more elucidation of a particular term or concept. In general the constant drip of data in my own life (web, books, podcasts on my shuffle while I’m in the checkout line at the supermarket) means that there are few moments of “cognitive stillness,” and I do wonder if that makes an aggregate difference in being able to see over the horizon and make unexpected connections….
