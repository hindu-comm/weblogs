Historical contingency & evolution in E. coli

You’ve probably read [Carl](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/06/02/a_new_step_in_evolution.php) and [Ed’s](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/06/history_restricts_and_guides_the_evolution_of_innovations.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&utm_medium=link&utm_content=channellink) posts, but the paper is finally out, [Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of *Escherichia coli*](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/0803151105v1?rss=1):

> The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, > but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of > Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They > have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains > citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic > conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for > \>30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of > mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one > population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population > size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this > function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare > mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one > whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on > prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in > experiments that “replayed” evolution from different points in that > population’s history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 1012 > ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 1012 cells from 60 clones sampled in > the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly > greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some > potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating > change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause > generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was > contingent on the particular history of that population. **More > generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially > important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that > are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.**
