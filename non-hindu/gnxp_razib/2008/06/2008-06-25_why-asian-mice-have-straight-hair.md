Why “Asian” mice have straight hair

Humans, being who we are, are really interested in how our external phenotype is shaped. Since the year 2000 many of the genetic underpinnings of the gross physical features which we use to categorize people, the sort of thing that might show up in a people description, have been elucidated. We know, for example, the [genes which control variation in skin color](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=skin+color+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) to a first approximation at this point. It also seems that we’ve zeroed in on the [primary gene](https://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&safe=off&client=pub-5976931228913298&cof=FORID%3A1%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&adkw=AELymgXhxhkMwzBLQDvZ3ZjEUJUwSQtUhCrqswCBl6DU2ILUd9L9ISTwmh3ozAPe1s-kNIyan7hVdMS-8eVw4n9_4x-e8GUC6OFakapK2if2MayBNu1IhAcsWJqCv-nJpJvD6yaXv0-jEA1OG0qtXvub8inZY8kdfq-yPKTruFkTdvxXYt7fpuP9be-_PDBdAbu8FrV4FlBZIzkU87jTRH-oIzf8RkVjag&q=eye+color+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&btnG=Search&cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0) responsible for eye color variation. Additionally, recently there’s been the discovery of the [gene which seems to control East Asian hair form](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/edar-controls-hair-thickness.php), *EDAR*. At [my other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/edar-again.php) p-ter [posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/edar-again.php) on a new paper, [Enhanced ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) signaling alters multiple fiber characteristics to produce the East Asian hair form](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119878552/abstract). **Go [there for the summary](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/edar-again.php) and awesome picture of the “Asian” mice.**
