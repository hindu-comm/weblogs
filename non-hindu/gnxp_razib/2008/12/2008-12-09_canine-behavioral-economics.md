Canine behavioral economics

[The absence of reward induces inequity aversion in dogs](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/12/08/0810957105.short?rss=1):

> One crucial element for the evolution of cooperation may be the > sensitivity to others’ efforts and payoffs compared with one’s own > costs and gains. Inequity aversion is thought to be the driving force > behind unselfish motivated punishment in humans constituting a > powerful device for the enforcement of cooperation. Recent research > indicates that non-human primates refuse to participate in cooperative > problem-solving tasks if they witness a conspecific obtaining a more > attractive reward for the same effort. However, little is known about > non-primate species, although inequity aversion may also be expected > in other cooperative species. Here, we investigated whether domestic > dogs show sensitivity toward the inequity of rewards received for > giving the paw to an experimenter on command in pairs of dogs. We > found differences in dogs tested without food reward in the presence > of a rewarded partner compared with both a baseline condition (both > partners rewarded) and an asocial control situation (no reward, no > partner), indicating that the presence of a rewarded partner matters. > Furthermore, we showed that it was not the presence of the second dog > but the fact that the partner received the food that was responsible > for the change in the subjects’ behavior. In contrast to primate > studies, dogs did not react to differences in the quality of food or > effort. **Our results suggest that species other than primates show at least a primitive version of inequity aversion, which may be a precursor of a more sophisticated sensitivity to efforts and payoffs of joint interactions.**

Remember that domestic dogs are the only non-human species which can read our facial expressions….
