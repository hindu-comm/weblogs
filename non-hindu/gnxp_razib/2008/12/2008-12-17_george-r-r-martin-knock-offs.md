George R. R. Martin knock-offs?

[A Sale of Two Doorstops](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=675):

More political intrigue, a darker moral world with many shades of grey, a grimmer arc of character development.

And that in turn maybe comes down to a bad combination of missing editorial input plus the genre-fueled need to bloat fantasy stories up to 600+ pages as if the heft of a paperback is what establishes it as a part of the genre.

  
I though the **exact same thing** when I read [Acacia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385722524/geneexpressio-20/). I would give it a B-. There is also some more positive assessment of [R. Scott Bakker’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Scott_Bakker) [Prince of Nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing) series. I agree that [The Darkness That Comes Before](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585676772/geneexpressio-20) (book 1 of *The Prince of Nothing*) is a more polished piece of prose than [Acacia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385722524/geneexpressio-20/), though the trilogy was a bit anticlimactic. Also, Bakker’s work is original in that it has a noticeable science fantasy dimension, and one of the most richly texture portraits of malevolence which I’ve encountered in fantasy, and an extremely thick cultural and historical context.  
H/T, appropriately, [The Elf](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/12/quote_of_the_day_9.php).
