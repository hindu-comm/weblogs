Facial Expressions Of Emotion Are Innate, Not Learned

[Spontaneous Facial Expressions of Emotion of Congenitally and Noncongenitally Blind Individuals](http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/psp9611.pdf):

> The study of the spontaneous expressions of blind individuals offers a > unique opportunity to understand basic processes concerning the > emergence and source of facial expressions of emotion. In this study, > the authors compared the expressions of congenitally and > noncongenitally blind athletes in the 2004 Paralympic Games with each > other and with those produced by sighted athletes in the 2004 Olympic > Games. The authors also examined how expressions change from 1 context > to another. There were no differences between congenitally blind, > noncongenitally blind, and sighted athletes, either on the level of > individual facial actions or in facial emotion configurations. Blind > athletes did produce more overall facial activity, but these were > isolated to head and eye movements. The blind athletesâ€™ expressions > differentiated whether they had won or lost a medal match at 3 > different points in time, and there were no cultural differences in > expression. These findings provide compelling evidence that the > production of spontaneous facial expressions of emotion is not > dependent on observational learning but simultaneously demonstrates a > learned component to the social management of expressions, even among > blind individuals.
