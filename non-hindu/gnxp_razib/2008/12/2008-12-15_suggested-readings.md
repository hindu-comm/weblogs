Suggested Readings

Brad Delong [reports](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/12/why-is-africa-p.html) that Yale professor [Chris Blattman](http://www.chrisblattman.org/) is looking for suggested readings for his class “Why is Africa poor and what (if anything) can the West do about it?” Blattman’s syllabus ([pdf](http://www.chrisblattman.org/Syllabus.pdf)) seems excellent but includes nothing on IQ. What reading(s) would the GNXP crowd suggest he add? I expect that your suggestions will be different from the ones that Professor Blattman has received on his [own blog](https://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-is-africa-poor.html).
