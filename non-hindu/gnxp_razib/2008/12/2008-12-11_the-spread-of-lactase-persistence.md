The spread of lactase persistence

Interesting bit of [interdisciplinary work](http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/12.11/11-past.html) on the spread of lactase persistance:

> Thomas found that the gene variant coincided well with the rise of animal domestication, indicating that humans became dairy farmers almost as soon as they began to keep animals.  
> To track the gene’s spread across Europe, Thomas designed a computer model that took into account both archaeological and genetic data. He then ran multiple simulations, randomly changing other variables and looking for patterns that matched what is known today.  
> The closest matches pegged the rise of milk-drinking Europeans to about 7,400 years ago in central Europe. **The spread matched the known rapid spread of Europe’s first farmers, the Linearbandkeramik culture.**  
> “The spread of the LP variation was shaped by selection and by an underlying demographic process, the spread of farming,” Thomas said.
