Paul Bloom on “Free Will”

Of all the bloggingheads.tv “regulars” I enjoy [Will Wilkinson’s](http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/) “Free Will” the most, probably because of an intersection of our interests and general outlooks (though Will is far more liberal than I am). Though the headline for this week’s episode has to do with atheism, the really interesting part of this interview with [Paul Bloom](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/inducing-disgust.php) is the second half. By the end of the diavlog Will admits that he aspires toward being a traitor to the United States, and that he isn’t too inclined to engage in a cannibal feast where his grandmother is the main course due to her lack of attraction to his palette. Also, Bloom makes a reference to the [Crying Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_Game) in fleshing out his nuanced views of hedonic utility. Oh, and is it me, or does Will look a lot younger than [this old photo](http://blog.kir.com/archives/wilkinson.jpg) from a few years back?
