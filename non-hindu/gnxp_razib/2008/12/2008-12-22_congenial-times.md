Congenial Times

Check out Mark Wethman’s new quant blog, [Congenial Times](https://congenialtimes.blogspot.com/). It’s been around for only a couple of weeks but in that time he’s posted a lot of interesting data/analysis on topics ranging from international politics to human biodiversity. [His most recent post](https://congenialtimes.blogspot.com/2008/12/race-and-education-in-sweden.html) is on racial differences in educational attainment in Sweden.

The most interesting article to me has been [the one on Amish IQ scores](https://congenialtimes.blogspot.com/2008/12/amish-intelligence.html). He found data which showed the Amish to have above average reasoning and quantitative analysis skills.\* Data like this is essential for anyone trying to understand the Flynn Effect or between-population differences on IQ scores.

\*They scored lower on language tests, but according to Jason Malloy this was solely due to the tests not being in their native Pennsylvania Dutch.
