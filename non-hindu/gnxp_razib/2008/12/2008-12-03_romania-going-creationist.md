Romania going Creationist?

[Romania removes theory of evolution from school curriculum](http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/4652/46/):

> Romania’s withdrawal of the theory of evolution from the school > curriculum could be evidence of a growing conservative tendency in teaching. Evolution has been removed from the school curriculum in a move which, pressure groups argue, distorts children’s understanding of how the world came into being.  
> Meanwhile, religious studies classes continue to tell Romanian children that God made the world in seven days.  
> The theory of the Origin of Species and the evolution of humans is no > longer present in the compulsory curriculum, through a nationwide > decision made under the previous Government in 2006. Before the change, Darwin’s theory was taught to pupils aged 18 or 19 years old. This was also in the curriculum during the Communist period of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

I’m not sure about the veracity of this story, it seems polemical. But with the outbreak of Creationism in [Turkey](http://richarddawkins.net/article,728,Turkey-Creationism-Documentary,The-Current) and [Serbia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3635794.stm), my priors for southeast Europe and its environs have shifted. Romania is evidence that even decades of state supported atheism are irrelevant if basic investment in education and human capital are not made, I suspect that the human mind is [wired for Creationism](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511u/paul-bloom).
