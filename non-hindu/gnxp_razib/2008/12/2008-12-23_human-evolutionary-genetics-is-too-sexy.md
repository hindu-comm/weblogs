Human evolutionary genetics is too sexy…

Say you have a abstruse paper such as, [Accelerated genetic drift on chromosome X during the human dispersal out of Africa](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.303.html):

> Comparisons of chromosome X and the autosomes can illuminate > differences in the histories of males and females as well as shed > light on the forces of natural selection. We compared the patterns of > variation in these parts of the genome using two datasets that we > assembled for this study that are both genomic in scale. Three > independent analyses show that around the time of the dispersal of > modern humans out of Africa, chromosome X experienced much more > genetic drift than is expected from the pattern on the autosomes. This > is not predicted by known episodes of demographic history, and we > found no similar patterns associated with the dispersals into East > Asia and Europe. We conclude that a sex-biased process that reduced > the female effective population size, or an episode of natural > selection unusually affecting chromosome X, was associated with the > founding of non-African populations.

Over at [Gene Expression Classic](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/12/x-chromsome-wtf.php) p-ter expresses his befuddlement:

> At the same time, another group (Keinan et al.) was independently > looking at this issue in other datasets. Their analysis, published > today is markedly different. In particular, they see the exact > opposite of the pattern in Hammer et al.–a decrease in the X/autosome > ratio in effective population size compared to 0.75 (a figure from > their paper is on the right. Note that the y-axis is the same in both > this and the Hammer et al. figure–the x/autosome ratio in Ne. In both, > the solid horizontal line is at 0.75). . And this is not due to > extremely different methodologies–one of the analyses presented by > Keinan et al. is very similar to that in Hammer et al., only using > different data.  
> **So this is all a bit odd, to say the least.**

All right. So how does this play in the press? They go crazy! [Did warfare drive out-of-Africa migration?](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16321-did-warfare-drive-outofafrica-migration.html):

> Roving bands of men might have waged history’s first traceable war > against the ancestors of all Europeans, Asians and other non-Africans, > some 60,000 years ago.
