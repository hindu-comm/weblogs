Low carb diets and cognitive function

[Low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets. Effects on cognition and mood](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WB2-4TB181Y-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=8ac6c083c0959d22333692a2c85fdb49):

> To examine how a low-carbohydrate diet affects cognitive performance, > women participated in one of two weight-loss diet regimens. > Participants self-selected a low-carbohydrate (n = 9) or a > reduced-calorie balanced diet similar to that recommended by the > American Dietetic Association (ADA diet) (n = 10). Seventy-two hours > before beginning their diets and then 48 h, 1, 2, and 3 weeks after > starting, participants completed a battery of cognitive tasks > assessing visuospatial memory, vigilance attention, memory span, a > food-related paired-associates a food Stroop, and the Profile of Moods > Scale (POMS) to assess subjective mood. Results showed that during > complete withdrawal of dietary carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate dieters > performed worse on memory-based tasks than ADA dieters. These > impairments were ameliorated after reintroduction of carbohydrates. > Low-carbohydrate dieters reported less confusion (POMS) and responded > faster during an attention vigilance task (CPT) than ADA dieters. > Hunger ratings did not differ between the two diet conditions. The > present data show memory impairments during low-carbohydrate diets at > a point when available glycogen stores would be at their lowest. A > commonly held explanation based on preoccupation with food would not > account for these findings. The results also suggest better vigilance > attention and reduced self-reported confusion while on the > low-carbohydrate diet, although not tied to a specific time point > during the diet. Taken together the results suggest that weight-loss > diet regimens differentially impact cognitive behavior.
