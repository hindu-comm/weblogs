Gene expression, African Americans & Europeans

[Effects of cis and trans Genetic Ancestry on Gene Expression in African Americans](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000294):

> ariation in gene expression is a fundamental aspect of human > phenotypic variation, and understanding how this variation is > apportioned among human populations is an important aim. Previous > studies have compared gene expression levels between distinct > populations, but it is unclear whether the differences that were > observed have a genetic or nongenetic basis. Admixed populations, such > as African Americans, offer a solution to this problem because > individuals vary in their proportion of European ancestry while the > analysis of a single population minimizes nongenetic factors. Here, we > show that differences in gene expression among African Americans of > different ancestry proportions validate gene expression differences > between European and African populations. Furthermore, by drawing a > distinction between an African American individual’s ancestry at the > location of a gene whose expression is being analyzed (cis) versus at > distal locations (trans), we can use ancestry effects to quantify the relative contributions of cis and trans regulation to human gene expression. We estimate that 12±3% of all heritable variation in human gene expression is due to cis variants.
