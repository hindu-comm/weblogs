Male & female rotation

[Sex Difference On Spatial Skill Test Linked To Brain Structure](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081217124430.htm):

> Men consistently outperform women on spatial tasks, including mental > rotation, which is the ability to identify how a 3-D object would appear if rotated in space. Now, a University of Iowa study shows a connection between this sex-linked ability and the structure of the parietal lobe, the brain region that controls this type of skill. >
> The parietal lobe was already known to differ between men and women, with women’s parietal lobes having proportionally thicker cortexes or “grey matter.” But this difference was never linked back to actual performance differences on the mental rotation test. >
> **UI researchers found that a thicker cortex in the parietal lobe in > women is associated with poorer mental rotation ability, and in a new > structural discovery, that the surface area of the parietal lobe is increased in men, compared to women.** Moreover, in men, the greater parietal lobe surface area is directly related to better performance on mental rotation tasks.
