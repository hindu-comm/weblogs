Height, weight, waist & BMI of Americans

[Steve](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/12/height-and-weight.html) has a modestly titled post up, [Height and Weight](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/12/height-and-weight.html), where he analyzes data from [Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults: 2003-2005](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf) (PDF). This is government data on American men, women and children who are Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American. I invite readers to peruse the raw data themselves. Steve did a little comparison of various parameters for males and females of the three populations. I thought it would be illustrative to plot the distributions of some the metrics so as to illustrate more intuitively the variation within the populations (the X axis are percentiles). [Half Sigma](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/12/big-white-women.html) pointed to Steve’s post, and the [discussion](http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/12/big-white-women.html) is unsurprisingly vibrant. I think it’s safe to assume there is “structure” in something like weight within these populations due to [geography](http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/07/05/297-the-south-shall-snack-again/) and SES. You can see this even in New York City, just start from [Bergdorf Goodman](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=bergdorf+goodman&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.41771,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ll=40.764169,-73.973227&spn=0.002247,0.004828&t=h&z=18) (especially around the Holidays) and walk north and east into the Upper East Side. Mean BMI starts dropping. In any case, like Steve I thought focusing on the 20-39 demographic was convenient, in part due to the nature of the readership of this weblog. Here’s the CDC’s [BMI Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_BMI/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.htm).
