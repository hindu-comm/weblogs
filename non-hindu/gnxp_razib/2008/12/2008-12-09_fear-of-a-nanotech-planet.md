Fear of a nanotech planet?

[David Kirkpatrick](http://davidkirkpatrick.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/the-religious-fear-nanotech/) points me to some interesting new research, [Religious beliefs and public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe and the United States](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nnano.2008.361.html):

> …Recent research suggests that ‘religious filters’ are an important > heuristic for scientific issues in general5, and nanotechnology in > particular6. A religious filter is more than a simple correlation > between religiosity and attitudes toward science: it refers to a link > between benefit perceptions and attitudes that varies depending on > respondents’ levels of religiosity. In surveys, seeing the benefits of > nanotechnology is consistently linked to more positive attitudes about > nanotechnology among less religious respondents, with this effect > being significantly weaker for more religious respondents6. For this > study, we have combined public opinion surveys in the United States > with Eurobarometer surveys about public attitudes toward > nanotechnology in Europe to compare the influence of religious beliefs > on attitudes towards nanotechnology in the United States and Europe. > **Our results show that respondents in the United States were > significantly less likely to agree that nanotechnology is morally > acceptable than respondents in many European countries.** These moral views correlated directly with aggregate levels of religiosity in each country, even after controlling for national research productivity and measures of science performance for high-school students.

As someone suspicious of non-religious, but New Age Gaia-worshiping, anti-science, I am generally surprised as to how thin it is on the ground. Though do note that Americans are more supportive of GMOs than Europeans….
