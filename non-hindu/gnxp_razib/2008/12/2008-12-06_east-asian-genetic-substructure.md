East Asian genetic substructure

Check out the [the charts](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/11/east-asian-genetic-substructure.html) over at [Steve Hsu’s site](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/11/east-asian-genetic-substructure.html). The author of a forthcoming paper sent him a draft. Since around 2/3 of the population of East Asia resides in China, there would be some value-add in getting many disparate samples from Han groups from all over the country and seeing what the population structure in the nation itself is.

**Update:** Here’s the [paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003862). They do in fact look at geographic structure in China, but it is at a relatively coarse level. Below the fold is a figure which I’ve reedited a bit for more illustrative power. The plot is across the first two principal components. Unfortunately many of these groups (e.g., Miao, who Americans know asÂ[Hmong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miao_people)) are obscure to most, though I’m sure the Xibo’s in the readership wil appreciate my labels. Also, remember that a majority of Chinese Americans are from southern dialect groups and regions. The oldest communities are Cantonese, but most of the recent immigrants are from Fujian, and the Taiwanese are over 90% of Fujian origins themselves (the residual being from all over China due to the post-1949 infux).
