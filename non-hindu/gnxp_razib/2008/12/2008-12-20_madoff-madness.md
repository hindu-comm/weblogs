Madoff Madness

*The New York Times* just published the definitive Bernie Madoff piece so far, [Madoff Scheme Kept Rippling Outward, Across Borders](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/business/20madoff.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=print). Reading about Madoff, I can’t help but think about this conversation attributed to J. P. Morgan:

> Untermyer: “Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or > property?”  
> Morgan: “No sir. The first thing is character.”  
> Untermyer: “Before money or property?”  
> Morgan: “Before money or property or anything else. Money cannot buy > it…because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the > bonds in Christendom.”

That sir, was the problem of course. And this sort of behavior:

> It was one of an unknown number of deals that prominent financial > figures set up in recent years and marketed to investors, who thought > they were tapping into the acumen of some Wall Street titan, like Mr. > Merkin.  
> As it turned out, their money wound up in the same place — in Bernie > Madoff’s hands.  
> These conduits began to steer billions of dollars into the Madoff > operation. They operated below the financial radar until Mr. Madoff’s > scheme collapsed, when investors suddenly got letters from the > sponsoring titan disclosing that all or most of their money was > probably gone.  
> Ascot itself attracted \$1.8 billion in investments, almost all of > which was entrusted to Mr. Madoff. New York Law School put \$3 million > into Ascot two years ago, and has now initiated a lawsuit in federal > court that accuses Mr. Merkin of abdicating his duties to the > partnership.  
> Mortimer Zuckerman, the billionaire owner of The Daily News, rebuked > Ascot in a televised interview, saying he had been misled about what > Mr. Merkin had done with some \$30 million from Mr. Zuckerman’s > charitable foundation.  
> Behind a wall of lawyers, Mr. Merkin did not take calls this week. In > the “Dear Limited Partner” letter he sent on Dec. 11, he noted that > he, too, was one of Mr. Madoff’s victims and suffered big losses > alongside his investors. He has taken steps to wind down his Ascot, > Gabriel and Ariel funds.  
> Still, some of his clients are stunned, and angry, to learn what Mr. > Merkin did with their millions, while collecting **an annual > management fee of 1.5 percent of the assets for his services.**

Greedy retards.
