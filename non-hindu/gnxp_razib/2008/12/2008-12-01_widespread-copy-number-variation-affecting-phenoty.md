Widespread copy number variation affecting phenotypes?

A [report in Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5906/1314) from the annual meeting of the American Society for Human Genetics focuses on copy number variation. Some interesting observations:

> Don Conrad and his colleagues at the Sanger Institute have their eyes > on smaller common CNVs, as little as 500 base pairs in length. > Checking about every 50 base pairs across parts of the genomes of > people of African and European ancestry, they uncovered more than > 10,000 CNVs–suggesting that other efforts, which have identified about > 1500 common ones, are missing most CNVs. Although “there haven’t been > many” CNVs linked to disease yet, Conrad said in his talk, “there > might be quite a few out there.” Indeed, he noted that 129 of the 419 > genetic-association regions pinpointed in genome-wide association > studies hunting for disease DNA contain a common CNV.
