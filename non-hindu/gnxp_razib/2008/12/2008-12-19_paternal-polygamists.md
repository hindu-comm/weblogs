Paternal polygamists

I don’t know much about this topic, but I thought this paper was cool, [Avian Paternal Care Had Dinosaur Origin](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;322/5909/1826):

> The repeated discovery of adult dinosaurs in close association with > egg clutches leads to speculation over the type and extent of care > exhibited by these extinct animals for their eggs and young. To assess > parental care in Cretaceous troodontid and oviraptorid dinosaurs, we > examined clutch volume and the bone histology of brooding adults. In > comparison to four archosaur care regressions, the relatively large > clutch volumes of Troodon, Oviraptor, and Citipati scale most closely > with a bird-paternal care model. Clutch-associated adults lack the > maternal and reproductively associated histologic features common to > extant archosaurs. Large clutch volumes and a suite of reproductive > features shared only with birds favor paternal care, possibly within a > polygamous mating system. Paternal care in both troodontids and > oviraptorids indicates that this care system evolved before the > emergence of birds and represents birds’ ancestral condition. In extant birds and over most adult sizes, paternal and biparental care correspond to the largest and smallest relative clutch volumes, respectively.

You can read the summary at [ScienceNow](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sciencenow;2008/1218/1), but here’s some cross-taxa context from [Polygamy, Paternal Care In Birds Linked To Dinosaur Ancestors](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081218141734.htm):

> Scientists had long wondered about the origins of polygamy and > paternal care patterns among modern-day Paleognathes — an ancient > avian lineage that branched off soon after birds evolved from > dinosaurs and includes ostriches, emus and tinamous. No such > reproductive behavior exists among the vast majority of other > vertebrates. **Males contribute to parental care in less than 5 percent of mammal and non-avian reptile species, and while more than 90 percent of bird species co-parent to some degree, it is only among the Paleognathes that both polygamy and paternal care rule.**

Nature is a wondrous thing!
