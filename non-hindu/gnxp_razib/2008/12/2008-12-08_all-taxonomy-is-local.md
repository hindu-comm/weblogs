All taxonomy is local?

Data are data. Interpretation though are a different beast. By coincidence Dan MacArthur [posted](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/12/genes_predict_the_ancestry_of.php) this figure yesterday:

I added the bold explanatory portion. African Americans are on the order of 20% European in ancestry, but this is not equally distributed across the population. [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/12/visual-display-of-biological-and-social.html) notes:

The variation in ancestry translates roughly to variation in appearance. Because the finite number of genes which control salient features (e.g., skin color, hair form and facial features) the correlation between ancestry and appearance [is imperfect](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=black+white+twin+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search). But, a substantial number of African Americans are so by choice; their ancestry and appearance is mostly European, and they could pass. But the flip side of this is that someone who is mostly of African ancestry and appearance can not simply “change” their racial affiliation so easily. The first photo is of [Walter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Francis_White):

> Walter Francis White (July 1, 1893, Atlanta, Georgia – March 21, 1955, > New York, New York) was a spokesman for blacks in the United States > for almost a quarter of a century as executive secretary (1931-1955) > of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He > graduated from Atlanta University in 1916 (now Clark Atlanta > University). In 1918 he joined the small national staff of the NAACP > in New York at the invitation of James Weldon Johnson.

![brownsciencebloggers.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/brownsciencebloggers.jpg?resize=273%2C140)![brownsciencebloggers.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/brownsciencebloggers.jpg?resize=273%2C140)But I can illustrate the point more clearly by contrasting myself and [Mo of Neurophilosophy](http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/?utm_source=bloglist&utm_medium=dropdown). Because Mo’s family is from Egypt, of Coptic background, some have classified him as one of the ScienceBloggers of color. I’ve meet Mo, nice guy. But, I have to say that if Mo changed his name, say to “Marcello,” he’d magically turn white in the perception of those who perceive him as non-white. On the other hand, if my name was “Marcello,” most of those who perceive me as non-white might assume that I was an Indian kid adopted by an Italian family. So the social “flexibility” of racial identity is highly contingent.
