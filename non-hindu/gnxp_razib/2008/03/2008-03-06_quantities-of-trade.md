Quantities of Trade

I’m almost done with [Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069111854X/geneexpressio-20/). So I found [this press release](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080304100410.htm) of interest:

Not much. But China is far away. There is an unfortunate problem in economic history and archaeology of assuming that the lit area of a dark street has all the answers. Some aspects of human history are easier to quantitize than others, but ease of precise comprehension and communication does not imply totality of understanding. Which is why narrative history in a more [classical sense](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/02/spanish-coincidence.php) is still important. But, an interest in one is not necessarily exclusive with an interest in the other, though in practical terms it often is (unfortunately). But in any case, I would though offer that 0.2% of a physical commodity imported from China in the Levant is orders of magnitude greater than the amount of trade between these regions 2,000 years before this period. I suspect that the world of 1,000 AD was far more of a [small-world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network) than the world of 10,000 BC, and that is important to keep in mind for dynamics of all types.
