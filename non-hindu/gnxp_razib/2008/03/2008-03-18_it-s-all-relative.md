It's all relative

I was talking the other day with a friend about why economists think they’re so smart [to the point of ignoring](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/meat-trade.php) easily accessible data from other fields. [Will](http://www.ambrosini.us/wordpress/2008/03/oh-boy/) points me to this [Greg Clark review](http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=zm1qcnxs5p3v7pwkq58f7hb3jlh8l0fk) of a new book from the field of economic sociology, [Adam Smith in Beijing](https://www.blogger.com/1844671046). Clark doesn’t think much of the reasoning, and my own first reaction was shock at what seemed to be a childishly naive argument worthy of a simpleton if the summary is accurate. Whatever the merits of the book, the arrogance of economists made a lot more sense if these were their adjacent fields whose scholarship they were aware of. Especially considering the relatively large number of economists who switched from physics or mathematics. Here are average [GRE scores by intended major](http://www.ncsu.edu/chass/philo/GRE%20Scores%20by%20Intended%20Graduate%20Major.htm) for graduate school.
