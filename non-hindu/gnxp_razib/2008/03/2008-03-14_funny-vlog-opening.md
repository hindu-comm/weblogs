Funny vlog opening

I generally skim only a few political/public policy weblogs via my RSS to get a sense of the Zeitgeist. [M. McArdle](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/) and [M. Yglesias](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/) are two of the blogs I sample. Anyway, if you read their blogs, check out the latest installment of [The Table](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1457731646?bctid=1457685041), the intro is really hilarious. Most-def trying to do the Gen-X ironic thing.
