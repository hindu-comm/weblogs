Impersonating Dan Dennett on religion

At [my other weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/religion-biology-psychology-sociology.php) a [long post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/religion-biology-psychology-sociology.php) on religion:

> On the most recent > [bloggingheads.tv](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/9785) you can > watch [Paul Bloom > explaining](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/9785?in=00:18:41) why he > thinks the propensity for theism is an innate bias of our species. > Several years back Bloom wrote a piece for The Atlantic, [Is God an > Accident?](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/200512/god-accident), > where he makes a similar case. But the general outline of Bloom’s line > of thinking is actually most powerfully argued in Scott Atran’s [In > God’s We > Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20). > The cognitive psychologists and anthropologists who work within this > paradigm are operate under some background assumptions in regards to > our mental architecture. First, human cognitive states are strongly > biased by innate tendencies which have a biological origin. Perception > and language acquisition are easily explained by nativist treatments, > but Atran and others have argued that more obscure biases such as > [folk biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_biology) also exist, > while other domains such as [theory of > mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) are broadly > accepted within the scholarly community.
