Religion & public attitudes: Europe vs. USA

A few years ago a poll came out, [Religious Views and Beliefs Vary Greatly by Country, According to the Latest Financial Times/Harris Poll](http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131). My title is a bit misleading insofar as the survey compared several European countries as well as the United States. Below the fold I’ve placed a few of the tables which I think might surprise, or not, depending on where you stand. One thing I will observe is that despite the substantive differences which lay at the heart of the rivalry between France and the United States, there are also similarities between these two “universal nations” that lead to some of the enmity since they both perceive each other to be brands competing in the same market.
