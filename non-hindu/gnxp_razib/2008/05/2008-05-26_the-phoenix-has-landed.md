The Phoenix has landed

As you probably know, the [Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(spacecraft)) has landed on Mars. No problems so far. I assume the best place to track the data as it comes back is the [NASA mission page](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html) for Phoenix. Here are the [mission goals](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/mission/index.html):

> –Determine whether Life ever arose on Mars  
> –Characterize the Climate of Mars  
> –Characterize the Geology of Mars  
> –Prepare for Human Exploration
