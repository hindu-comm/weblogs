GLUT2 (SLC2A2) & sugar intake

Via [Luis](https://leherensuge.blogspot.com/), [Genetic variant in the glucose transporter type 2 is associated with higher intakes of sugars in two distinct populations](http://physiolgenomics.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/3/355):

> Glucose sensing in the brain has been proposed to be involved in > regulating food intake, but the mechanism is not known. Glucose > transporter type 2 (GLUT2)-null mice fail to control their food intake > in response to glucose, suggesting a potential role for this > transporter as a glucose sensor in the brain. Here we show that > individuals with a genetic variation in GLUT2 (Thr110Ile) have a > higher daily intake of sugars in two distinct populations. In the > first population, compared with individuals with the Thr/Thr genotype, > carriers of the Ile allele had a significantly higher intake of sugars > as assessed from 3-day food records administered on two separate > visits…demonstrating within-population reproducibility. In a second > population, carriers of the Ile allele also reported consuming a > significantly greater intake of sugars…over a 1-mo period as measured > from a food frequency questionnaire. GLUT2 genotypes were not > associated with fat, protein, or alcohol intake in either population. > These observations were consistent across older and younger adults as > well as among subjects with early Type 2 diabetes and healthy > individuals. Taken together, our findings show that a genetic variation in GLUT2 is associated with habitual consumption of sugars, suggesting an underlying glucose-sensing mechanism that regulates food intake.

Seems like nutrient metabolism & taste preferences are some really important angles for personal genomics; people spend so much time trying to decide what to eat, and arguing about what and how to eat amongst each other. Looks like there’s a fair amount of [between population difference](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=5400#Diversity) on this SNP.
