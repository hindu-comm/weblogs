French more fecund than the Irish?

[Walker’s World: French births soar](http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Emerging_Threats/Analysis/2008/04/30/walkers_world_french_births_soar/2087/):

A few points. First, even if there is convergence differentials still do matter. One thing I noted when surveying data on Mormon fertility is that though it has converged with non-Mormon fertility, the “floor” still usually remains higher than that of local non-Mormons. I’m not worried about a Mormon future of course because it is also a religion with a relatively high defection rate, but long term persistence of small differences do matter. Second, projecting to the year 2100 as many do today is very problematic. In the late 19th century some bureaucrats in the Ottoman government were relieved as the Christian Balkan provinces fell away through independence or assimilation into the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. The reason being the fact that Christians had higher fertility than Muslims; something most Muslims and Christians today would find a very peculiar worry. In [After Tamerlane](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596913932/geneexpressio-20) there is a reference to a racial triumphalist demographer writing in 1900 about the “fact” that in the year 2000 there will be 1.5 billion whites and only 400 million Han Chinese. Finally, variance matters. [Note](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/02/selection_at_work.php):

Italy and Germany might both have low expectations in regards to the number of children a woman may have in her lifetime, but the shape of the distribution may matter a great deal if fertility is heritable to any extent (straight out of [Genetical Theory](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198504403/geneexpressio-20/) here). Heritability need not be physiological; rather, it might be cultural and psychological propensities transmitted to the next generation. But if the data above hold one might expect German fertility to bounce back faster than Italian because a subset of the German population exhibit pro-natalist sentiments.
