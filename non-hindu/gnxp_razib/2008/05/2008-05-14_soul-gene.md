Soul gene?

Ron Bailey in *Reason*, [The Genetics of Ensoulment](http://www.reason.com/news/show/126434.html):

> Advances in stem cell research may be provoking a kind of “God of the > Gaps” retreat on the moral status of embryos. People who subscribe to > God of the Gaps thinking believe that the hand of God can be seen in > those things which science cannot explain. In this case, the closing gaps in the details of molecular biology are forcing pro-lifers into an uncomfortable corner where they have to decide whether or not a cell can be imbued with a soul **by turning a single gene on or off.**
