Biblical literalism or low IQ: which came first?

**Update II:** Many links into this entry are labeling this a “study.” It wasn’t a study, I literally took 10 minutes before I went to sleep to collect the data and produce the chart. The data on literal interpretation of the Bible is from [a book which you can read via Google](https://books.google.com/books?id=NyIWwZweW9oC&pg=PA57&dq=Episcopalian++Lutheran++Mormon++Presbyterian++United+Methodist+++Southern+Baptist+++Assembly+of+God+++Pentecostal+literal&ei=1WE6SJ2PLIvAsgP3vPHPDA&sig=261VPywNQAfJ25hhdOoOiutOiEE). The IQ scores are from the [General Social Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Social_Survey) as reported by [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2008/02/odd-religions-and-iq-discussion-of.html). I already knew that this sort of correlation existed, it’s pretty unsurprising as I noted. The same pattern shows up if you use post-graduate eduation as the dependent variable. And I spot checked [SAT scores by denomination](http://www.arthurhu.com/99/12/cminor.txt), and again the association shows up. All that being said, the title was obviously tongue-in-cheek.  
**Update:** Follow up post….  
A few months ago I posted data which showed, unsurprisingly, that Unitarian-Universalists tend to have high IQs and Pentecostals not so much. What about something like Biblical literalism and IQ? Well, I plotted the IQ values from the General Social Survey for selected denominations and plotted them against the proportion [which believed in a literal interpretation](https://books.google.com/books?id=NyIWwZweW9oC&pg=PA57&dq=Episcopalian++Lutheran++Mormon++Presbyterian++United+Methodist+++Southern+Baptist+++Assembly+of+God+++Pentecostal+literal&ei=1WE6SJ2PLIvAsgP3vPHPDA&sig=261VPywNQAfJ25hhdOoOiutOiEE) of the Bible. Prepare to be greeted by a very banal reality below the fold….

Also, convert the IQ values into percentiles….

**Note:** Some difference due to rounding. Also, the IQ values are for whites.
