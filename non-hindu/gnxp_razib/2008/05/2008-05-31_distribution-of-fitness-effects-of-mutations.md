Distribution of fitness effects of mutations?

Havenâ€™t had a time to check this paper out, but looks real interesting, [Assessing the Evolutionary Impact of Amino Acid Mutations in the Human Genome](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000083):

> Although mutations are known to cause varying degrees of harmful > effects, it is difficult to quantify the distribution that best > describes the variation of fitness effects of these mutations. Here we > present a new method for inferring this distribution and inferring > population history using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data > from human populations. Using 47,576 SNPs discovered in 11,404 genes > from sequencing 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African > Americans), we find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the > sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the > sample with European ancestry. **In both populations, the patterns of > variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection > coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality.** > Specifically, we predict 27-29% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) > mutations are neutral or nearly neutral, 30-42% are moderately > deleterious, and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal. Furthermore, we infer that 10-20% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees were fixed by positive selection, with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral.

Leptokurtosis describes a more acute peak around the mean.
