Gender & science

My friend Jake Young has a post up, [Contrasting Views on the Gender Disparity in Science](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/05/contrasting_views_on_the_gende.php):

> Second, one of my primary arguments against innate differences in > ability between men and women is that you are dealing with traits that > have distributions and those distributions largely overlap. Making a > statement about any individual man or woman is largely useless. The > odds of a women or man selected at random being better or worse at > math are not particularly different. This argument applies just as > well to differences in preference. Maybe there are differences on > average, but they are still distributions that overlap. The key > question becomes: to what degree do those distributions overlap? How > different on men’s and women’s preferences on average?

James Crow’s [Unequal by nature: a geneticist’s perspective on human differences](http://www.amacad.org/publications/winter2002/Crow.pdf) is apropos here:

> There is actually a simple explanation that is well known to > geneticists and statisticians, but not widely understood by the > general public or, for that matter, by political leaders. Consider a > quantitative trait that is distributed according to the normal, > bell-shaped curve. IQ can serve as an example. About one person in 750 > has an iq of 148 or higher. In a population with an average of about > 108 rather than 100, hardly a noticeable difference, about 5 times as > many will be in this high range. In a population averaging 8 points > lower, there will be about 6 times fewer. A small difference of 8 > points in the mean translates to severalfold differences in the > extremes. >

> My conclusion, to repeat, is that whenever a society singles out > individuals who are outstanding or unusual in any way, the statistical > contrast between means and extremes comes to the fore. I think that > recognizing this can eventually only help politicians and social > policymakers.
