Two new pigmentation papers

There are four regions because areas around HERC2/OCA2 and MAPT showed signals. MAPT is also known as AIM1 and SLC45A2, so this makes 3 genes of the potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchangers implicated in pigmentation (the other is SLC24A5 obviously). They adjusted for the components of genetic variation so as not to be confounded by population stratification (i.e., there was some ethnic variation among their whites and so you don’t have a random mating population).  
And [p-ter points](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/05/more-pigmentation-genetics.php) me to, [Two newly identified genetic determinants of pigmentation in Europeans](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.160.html):

*TPCN2* seems to have a blonde/brown hair effect in Europeans. Interestingly Haplotter says there’s a recent selective event in Asians about 2 Mb upstream. p-ter says:

One possibility is that it’s because pigmentation > has been subject to strong recent selection–theory predicts that the > initial moves toward an new fitness optimum will be loci of large > effects, while the later moves will be smaller. Perhaps since this selective pressure has been so recent, we’re still picking up those initial mutations of large effect that are still segregating in the population?
