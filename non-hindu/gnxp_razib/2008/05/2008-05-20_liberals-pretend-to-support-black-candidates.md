Liberals pretend to support black candidates?

[Noam Scheiber](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/05/19/more-bradley-effect-evidence.aspx) points to working paper, [SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS IN ESTIMATED SUPPORT FOR A BLACK PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE](http://homepages.nyu.edu/~jah321/sdb_black_pres.pdf), which attempts to figure out the Bradley Effect by guaging avowed vs. implied support. Mark Blumenthal of [Myster Pollster](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/) has an interview where one of the authors explains the methodology and touches upon some confusing issues….

**To a great extent I think this is the sort of thing which should give us caution about overreading from social science; you might not be smoking out the dynamics which you think you are smoking out.** I’ve put the results from the most relevant table below the fold; remember that “True Support” is a calculated projection, and if you are curious about p-values just go to the paper itself.
