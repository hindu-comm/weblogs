Positive selection on EDAR, why East Asians & Native Americans have thick hair

[Positive Selection in East Asians for an EDAR Allele that Enhances NF-κB Activation](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002209):

We’ve blogged about *[EDAR](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=edar)* before; [Could it be hair form?](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/could-it-be-hair-form.php), [EDAR controls hair thickness](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/edar-controls-hair-thickness.php) and [EDAR and hair thickness](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/03/edar-and-hair-thickness.php). The story here is simple, before the populations ancestral to the Native Americans had left eastern Asia a mutation on the *EDAR* gene swept nearly to fixation among these populations. The derived [SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=3827760) in particular is correlated with the thicker hair typical of East Asians and Native Americans. In other populations (Europeans, Africans, West and South Asians as well as Papuans and Melanesians) the SNP is in an ancestral state. The main twist in this study is that they used a molecular genetic technique to show that this derived state seems to upregulate the activity of [NF-κB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF-%CE%BAB) [transcription factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor).

For the record, I’m really skeptical that this selective sweep occurred because the human populations of late Ice Age eastern Asia developed a really strong attraction to thick luxuriant hair with full body. The paper is Open Access, read [the whole thing](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002209). Since the most interesting figure is either too small or too large, I’ve resized it appropriately and placed it below the fold.
