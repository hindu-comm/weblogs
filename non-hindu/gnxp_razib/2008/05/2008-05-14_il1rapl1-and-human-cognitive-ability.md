IL1RAPL1 and human cognitive ability

[A study on the correlation between IL1RAPL1 and human cognitive ability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18467032?dopt=Abstract):

> This study aimed to investigate the effects of IL1RAPL1 on the human > cognitive ability…Results indicated that genotypes of DXS1218, DXS9896 > and rs12847959 were associated with memory/concentration factor > intelligence quotient (IQ)…DXS1218 also associated with full IQ, > verbal IQ, and performance IQ…rs12847959 were related to verbal > comprehension factor and perceptual organization factor IQ…Further > study on rat brain revealed that Il1rapl was mainly expressed in > memory/concentration-associated encephalic regions, such as > hippocampus, dentate fascia, osmesis perithelium, and piriform cortex. > mRNA expression levels of Il1rapl in brains of rats with different learning and memory abilities showed significant difference. Combined data suggested that IL1RAPL1 affected human cognitive ability to some extent, especially the memory and concentration capability.

Check out the [HapMap](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=12847959#Diversity) on that SNP. Remember to wait up on reproducibility here. Sandy [has a longer post](http://anthropology.net/2008/05/14/il1rapl1-genotype-intelligence/) addressing the radioactivity of such research (obviously he is lying when he says he’s an anthropologist; doesn’t pass the smell test).
