Executive functions mostly heritable?

[99% Genetic? Individual Differences in Executive Function Are Almost Perfectly Heritable](http://scienceblogs.com/developingintelligence/2008/05/99_genetic_individual_differen.php):

> The results from this approach are jaw-dropping: variance shared among > each variety of executive function (inhibition, updating, and > shifting) is nearly perfectly heritable: the contribution of the “A” > component to those correlations is 99%. This heritable variance in the > common executive function predicts nearly all of the genetic variance > in the inhibition factor, consistent with the idea that those > constructs are isomorphic from a heritability standpoint. Second, > genetic influences on updating and shifting were roughly half due to > the common executive function (43% and 44%, respectively) and half due to unique genetic influences (56% and 42%, respectively). Thus, the overall picture is that executive functions, in both their unity and diversity, are somewhere between 86 to 100% heritable.

I wonder if such high heritabilities imply many adaptive equilibria in terms of personality phenotype with all populations? (remember the rule of thumb that the more **heritable** a trait is the less fitness implication it has)
