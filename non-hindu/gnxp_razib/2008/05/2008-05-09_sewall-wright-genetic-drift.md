Sewall Wright & genetic drift

[Notes on Sewall Wright: Genetic Drift](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/05/notes-on-sewall-wright-genetic-drift.php):

> Continuing my series of notes on the work of Sewall Wright, this one > deals with the subject of genetic drift. I had originally planned to > call this note ‘Inbreeding and the decline of genetic variance’, but > anyone interested in the matters covered here, and searching for them > on the internet, is far more likely to search for ‘genetic drift’. > This is one of the subjects most closely associated with Wright, to > the extent that genetic drift was formerly often known as the ‘Sewall > Wright Effect’. My main aim is to help people follow Wright’s own > derivation of his key results, and to clarify the relationship between > genetic drift and inbreeding.

Also, you might be interested in [Will Provine’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Provine) seminal work, [Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226684733/geneexpressio-20/). Provine synthesizes science, biography and history in such a manner so as to extract more than the sum of the parts.
