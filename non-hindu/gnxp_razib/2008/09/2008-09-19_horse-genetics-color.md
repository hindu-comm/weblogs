Horse genetics & color

Thank god for animals and their resemblance to humans to elucidate general patterns and relationships. [Missense Mutation in Exon 2 of SLC36A1 Responsible for Champagne Dilution in Horses](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000195):

> The purpose of this study was to uncover the molecular basis for the > champagne hair color dilution phenotype in horses. Here, we report a > DNA base substitution in the second exon of the horse gene SLC36A1 > that changes an amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the protein > from threonine to arginine. **The phenotypic effect of this base > change is a diminution of hair and skin color intensity for both red > and black pigment in horses, and the resulting dilution has become > known as champagne.** This is the first genetic variant reported for > SLC36A1 and the first evidence for its effect on eye, skin, and hair > pigmentation. So far, no other phenotypic effects have been attributed to this gene. This discovery of the base substitution provides a molecular test for horse breeders to test their animals for the Champagne gene (CH).

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/lobo_head-706877.jpg)Is horse color a big deal in terms of value? I wonder what the reason why there are so many horse pigmentation papers as opposed to a cheaper multi-colored animal like dog or cat.
