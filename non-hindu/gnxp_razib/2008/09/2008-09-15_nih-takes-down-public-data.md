NIH takes down public data

In response to [a recent paper](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/dna-forensics-goes-genome-wide.php) detailing how to identify an individual from aggregate allele frequency data, the NIH [has removed all such data](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1165490) under its control from the public eye.

This is obviously overkill (to identify an individual from such data, one would have to have genotyped them independently), but itâ€™s easier to inconvenience a few scientists than risk a PR backlash. Stories like this make it clear that expectations of privacy in terms of genetic data need a major rethinking; the [open consent model of the Personal Genome Project](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v9/n5/abs/nrg2360.html) is worth a very close look.
