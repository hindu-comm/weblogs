Mice & digit ratio

[Selective Breeding for a Behavioral Trait Changes Digit Ratio](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003216):

> The ratio of the length of the second digit (index finger) divided by > the fourth digit (ring finger) tends to be lower in men than in women. > This 2D:4D digit ratio is often used as a proxy for prenatal androgen > exposure in studies of human health and behavior. For example, 2D:4D > ratio is lower (i.e. more ‘masculinized’) in both men and women of > greater physical fitness and/or sporting ability. Lab mice have also > shown variation in 2D:4D as a function of uterine environment, and > mouse digit ratios seem also to correlate with behavioral traits, > including daily activity levels. Selective breeding for increased > rates of voluntary exercise (wheel running) in four lines of mice has > caused correlated increases in aerobic exercise capacity, circulating > corticosterone level, and predatory aggression. Here, we show that > this selection regime has also increased 2D:4D. This apparent > ‘feminization’ in mice is opposite to the relationship seen between > 2D:4D and physical fitness in human beings. The present results are > difficult to reconcile with the notion that 2D:4D is an effective proxy for prenatal androgen exposure; instead, it may more accurately reflect effects of glucocorticoids, or other factors that regulate any of many genes.
