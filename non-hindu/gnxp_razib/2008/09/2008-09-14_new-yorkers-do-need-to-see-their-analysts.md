New Yorkers do need to see their analysts

[A Theory of the Emergence, Persistence, and Expression of Geographic Variation in Psychological Characteristics](http://web.mac.com/jrentfrow/iWeb/Dr.%20Peter%20Jason%20Rentfrow/PJR%20Publications_files/Rentfrow--Geography%20of%20Personality.pdf):

> Volumes of research show that people in different geographic regions > differ psychologically. Most of that work converges on the conclusion > that there are geographic differences in personality and values, but > little attention has been paid to developing an integrative account of > how those differences emerge, persist, and become expressed at the > geographic level. Drawing from research in psychology and other social > sciences, we present a theoretical account of the mechanisms through > which geographic variation in psychological characteristics emerge and > persist within regions, and we propose a model for conceptualizing the > processes through which such characteristics become expressed in > geographic social indicators.

Nothing too surprising, but I’ve put the maps and most relevant data below the fold. If a correlation isn’t there, it is because it wasn’t statistically significant or below 0.20.
