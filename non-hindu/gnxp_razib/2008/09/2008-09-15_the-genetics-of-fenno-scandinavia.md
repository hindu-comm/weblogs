The genetics of Fenno-Scandinavia

[Population substructure in Finland and Sweden revealed by the use of spatial coordinates and a small number of unlinked autosomal SNPs](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/54):

> We genotyped 34 unlinked autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms > (SNPs), originally designed for zygosity testing, from 2044 samples > from Sweden and 657 samples from Finland, and 30 short tandem repeats > (STRs) from 465 Finnish samples. **We saw significant population > structure within Finland but not between the countries or within > Sweden, and isolation by distance within Finland and between the > countries.** In Sweden, we found a deficit of heterozygotes that we > could explain by simulation studies to be due to both a small > non-random genotyping error and hidden substructure caused by > immigration. Geneland, a model-based Bayesian clustering algorithm, > clustered the individuals into groups that corresponded to Sweden and > Eastern and Western Finland when spatial coordinates were used, > whereas in the absence of spatial information, only one cluster was > inferred.

I’ve cut edited two of the most interesting figures below.

Now a figure which illustrates genetic variation clustered by the counties. I’ve cropped and rotated the chart, but if you click it you will see it in its original non-inverted form.

Here’s an interesting tidbit:

> The principal component analysis clearly separated the Finnish regions > and Eastern and Western counties from the Swedish as well as the > Finnish regions and counties from each other…Geneland showed three > clusters (Figure 3B), roughly corresponding to Sweden, Eastern Finland > and Western Finland. Thus, Geneland was able to correctly identify the > country of origin of the individuals despite the lower quality of the > Swedish data. Interestingly, the county-level PCA…and Geneland…placed > the Finnish subpopulation of Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia closest to > Sweden. This minority population originates from the 13th century, > when Swedish settlers inhabited areas of coastal Finland…**Our result > is in congruence with earlier studies where intermediate allele > frequencies between Finns and Swedes have been observed in the Swedish > speaking Finns**….

Are Swedish speaking citizens of Finland the descendants of Finnish speakers who acculturated to a Swedish identity? Or are they the descendants of immigrants from Sweden? These are the questions genetics allows one to explore.
