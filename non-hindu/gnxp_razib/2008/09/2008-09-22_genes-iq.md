Genes & IQ

[Carl Zimmer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/09/19/genes-and-intelligence-my-anti-story/) has a [post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/09/19/genes-and-intelligence-my-anti-story/) up where he points to a [piece](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=searching-for-intelligence-in-our-genes) he just wrote for *Scientific American*, [Searching for Intelligence in Our Genes](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=searching-for-intelligence-in-our-genes). Here’s the major point:

> Intelligence tests do identify a difference among people that has predictive power, and that difference can be linked-in part-to differences in people’s genes.  
> The news about intelligence is that now scientists have new tools for > probing intelligence, from brain scans to gene chips that can search > for variations in half a million genetic markers at a time. **But so > far, those tools are yielding some pretty scant results.** For example, just a handful of genes show much sign of influencing intelligence, and yet each one accounts at best for a fraction of one percent of the variation in test scores.

Jason Malloy says in the [comments](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/09/19/genes-and-intelligence-my-anti-story/#comment-9660):

I doubt intelligence is > very unique compared with other quantitative genetics traits. > [Height](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=height+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) and intelligence, for example are similar in a lot of ways (e.g. similar heritabilities), and we’re seeing the same stuff with the genetics of height.

The heritability of height on a modern developed society is on the order of 0.80. There are some studies which suggest IQ might be [about the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ#Heritability), though others push it all the way down to the 0.20-0.30 range. As Jason implies it looks like aside from pathological retardation variation in intelligence is due to the mass action of a huge number of loci, just like height. In this [skin color](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=skin+color+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) has been the exceptional low hanging fruit of quantitative traits, most of the between population variance can be pinpointed to half a dozen genes. In any case, with all that in mind I have [suggested an easier way](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/design-brainy-babies-easier-way.php) to produce a “designer” high IQ baby even if we don’t know the genes implicated in the phenotype….
