R. A. Fisher on Population Size: Addendum

A while ago I posted two notes on R. A. Fisher’s views on population size: Part 1 [here](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/09/fisher-and-wright-on-population-size.php) and Part 2 [here](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/fisher-and-wright-on-population-size.php). I assembled some evidence from The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection suggesting that Fisher believed the population size of a species was usually between a million and a million million, with the latter figure being a realistic possibility for some species of small invertebrates.

In writing that post I could not find any more direct evidence, so I am pleased to have come across a letter from Fisher to C. Tate Regan, dated 7 February 1927, containing the following explicit statement:

> The population number of 10^6 \[1,000,000\] parents in each generation > represents a somewhat small species. I suppose most species lie > between 10^6 and 10^12 \[1,000,000,000,000\], although some, such as > some of the millipedes, certainly exceed the latter figure. The larger > the population the less frequent need mutations be to maintain a given > stock of segregating factors, or in other words, with the same > mutation rates the larger will the variance (when equilibrium is > attained) be. (Bennett, ed., p.255)

Earlier in the letter Fisher makes it clear that he is thinking about genes that are nearly neutral in their effect, so that variance is maintained by a balance between mutation and drift.

A population of a million million does seem very large, but Fisher’s reference to millipedes confirms that he was thinking of small inverterbrates, where very large populations are quite possible. For example, a population of a million million would only require an average density of one per square metre over an area of about a tenth the size of the United States.
