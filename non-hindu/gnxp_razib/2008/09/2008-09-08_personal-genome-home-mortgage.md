Personal genome ~ home mortgage?

[Is a personal genome sequence worth \$350,000?](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/09/your_own_private_genome.php):

In other words, the data appreciates. But unlike buying a home mortgage, there is going to be a mass drop in the cost in the near future. This [figure](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/info_cost_curve.jpg) illustrates the point effectively. To some extent then the analogy to the housing market breaks down. In many regions of the world fixed stock of land means that values will increase over the long term (since populations and per capita purchasing power are increasing) so “getting in early” makes sense. Rather, it’s like buying a Kindle; everyone is going in that direction at some point but early adopters are going to pay a premium for gaining access to that utility bundle before the rest of us. Of course, **the very fact that we’re mooting these choices says something about the state of the game.**
