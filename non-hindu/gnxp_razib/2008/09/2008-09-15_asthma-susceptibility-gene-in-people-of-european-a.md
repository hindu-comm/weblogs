Asthma susceptibility gene in people of European ancestry

[ORMDL3 variants associated with asthma susceptibility in North Americans of European ancestry](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WH4-4T9TC0S-8&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d5c5064789dd2f89d0c9bd472361caf4).

> Asthma researchers have found that a gene variant known to raise the risk of childhood asthma in **European children plays a similar role in white American children, but not in African American children.**
