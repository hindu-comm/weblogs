Building an ugly dog

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/chinese_crested_2-757443.jpg)This week’s Science has [a nice article](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/5895/1462) mapping the hairless phenotype in dogs to a small deletion in a poorly-characterized transcription factor. One of the hairless breeds used in mapping is the [Chinese Crested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Crested_Dog), members of which are perennial contenders in the [World’s Ugliest Dog Competition](http://animal.discovery.com/convergence/ugly_dog/uglydog.html). As more dog phenotypes are mapped, one imagines that this competition will be taken over by hideous genetically-modified freaks with the hair/tooth-lessness of the Chinese Crested, the slobber of a [Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(dog)), the legs of a [Daschund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund), and the [rage of a Springer Spaniel](http://www.vetinfo4dogs.com/daggressp.html). The horror.
