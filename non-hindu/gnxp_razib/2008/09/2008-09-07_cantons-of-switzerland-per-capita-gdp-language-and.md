Cantons of Switzerland, per capita GDP, language and religion

**Update:** Added populations.

**Update:** Added 1980 vintage language data. Note that Italians are the largest foreign population traditionally.

**Update II:** I tried to plot the 1980 language proportions against 2005 per capita income. I know, not kosher, but doesn’t matter, almost none of the income variation can be accounted for by language variation (around 5%, with a slight positive relation between Germanity and wealth). Using the 1980 language data and 2005 per capita cantonal GDP the nominal per capita GDP would be 56,000 for German speakers and 51,000 for French speakers.

A commenter asked about Switzerland. I’d been meaning to look deeper into the issue for a long time, so I decided to give it a try. Below the fold are the Swiss Cantons organized by the variables you see in the title. I had to collect the information from various sources, explaining the obviously non-Anglicized names of some of the Cantons (I’ve just finished looking up the language and religious proportions in a somewhat time consuming manner, so I am not inclined to change the names since they’re rather intelligible). I ran into some papers relating factors such as government expenditure and economic productivity and Protestantism, but I’ll leave the data without comment and as a reference for readers. I also included a map below which can give you a sense of where the Cantons are and the distributed. One thing to note, several sources noted that in Switzerland Protestantism historically tended to be urban, which I thing goes a long way toward explaining what seems to be a difference in per capita GDP.
