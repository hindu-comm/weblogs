Genes and facial features

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/09/ashg-2008-abstracts.html) posted a bunch of abstracts from a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. This one jumped out at me:

> Seven selection-nominated candidate genes (COL11A1, LMNA, FGFR1, > FGFR2, TRPS, BRAF, FLNA) known to be involved in Mendelian > craniofacial dysmorphologies and to have high allele frequency > differences between West African and European populations were tested > for admixture linkage to normal facial feature traits. The sample > consists of 254 subjects (n=131 African Americans, n=123 Brazilians) > of West African and European genetic ancestry. Each individual was > genotyped at 176 ancestry informative markers (AIMs), which allowed > for proportional estimation of genetic ancestry from four parental > populations and adjustments for admixture stratification. >
> 3D images of faces were acquired using the 3dMDface imaging system. 3D > coordinate data were collected from 22 landmarks placed on each image > using the 3dMDPatient software. The 231 possible pairwise landmark > distances were scaled to the geometric mean and then analyzed using > Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis. >
> We used both ANOVA and ADMIXMAP to control for admixture > stratification and to test for associations between the 231 pairwise > landmark distances and 183 AIMs, using sex, height and BMI as > covariates. We used a four-population model (West African, European, > East Asian, and Native American). >
> There is a strong concordance between the ANOVA and ADMIXMAP results. > Many landmark distances, particularly on the mouth and nose, were > significantly associated with genetic ancestry. Additionally, three of > the candidate genes show no effects on pairwise landmark distances > while four show distinct patterns of association. For example, FGFR2 > is associated primarily with the length of the face. These results > represent the first identification of the first genes affecting normal > variation in facial features.

A definite new twist possible on [DNA forensics](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/dna-forensics-goes-genome-wide.php).
