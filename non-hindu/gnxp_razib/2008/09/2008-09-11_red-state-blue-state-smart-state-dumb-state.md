Red state, blue state, smart state, dumb state

[Thoughts on educational attainment and voting patterns at the state level](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/09/thoughts-on-educational-attainment-and.html):

> The percentage of a state’s population with a bachelor’s-plus does not > correlate nearly as strongly with estimated IQ scores based on NAEP > data (.46) as the percentage of a state’s population with less than a > high school education (.72) does. The prolish behavior HS detests > might be better indicated by the less than high school percentage than > by the bachelor-plus number, depending on where the cutoff is\*. Both measures include similar proportions of the population (19.6% of the population over 25 years of age has less than a high school diploma, while 24.4% has a bachelor’s-plus).  
> **Taking the bachelor-plus percentage by state, subtracting the less > than high school education percentage from it, and multiplying by 100 for ease of viewing, creates a simple educational attainment index** by state that more fully accounts for not just the right side of a state’s educational distribution, but the entire thing:

> 1\. Colorado — 19.6  
> 2. Massachusetts — 18.0  
> 3. New Hampshire — 16.1  
> 4. Vermont — 15.8  
> 5. Connecticut — 15.4  
> …  
> 46. Louisiana — (6.5)  
> 47. Arkansas — (8.0)  
> 48. Kentucky — (8.8)  
> 49. West Virginia — (10.0)  
> 50. Mississippi — (10.2)

To see the full list, [read the whole thing](https://anepigone.blogspot.com/2008/09/thoughts-on-educational-attainment-and.html). Do remember though that **between state trends do not necessarily translate into within state trends.** Even within state trends do not translate to locality level trends. Consider the fact that the Democratic areas of New York state are the wealthiest on a coarse scale, but within Manhattan the more Republican precincts are in the wealthiest district (the Upper East Side).  
**Related:** Conservatives are as smart as liberals.
