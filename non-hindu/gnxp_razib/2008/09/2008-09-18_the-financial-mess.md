The financial mess

Excellent [summary](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/diamond-and-kashyap-on-the-recent-financial-upheavals/). I don’t have anything to add obviously; I’ve heard/read all the fragments, but nice to see it all in one place from people in the know. H/T [The Elf](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/).
