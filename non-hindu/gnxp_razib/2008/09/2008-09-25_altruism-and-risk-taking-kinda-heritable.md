Altruism and Risk-Taking: Kinda Heritable

Economists are getting into the twin-study game more often. The [latest entry](http://econ-www.mit.edu/files/3189) is forthcoming in the Harvard-MIT run Quarterly Journal of Economics. They ran tests on a bunch of [Swedish twins](https://stilinberlin.blogspot.com/2007/11/swedish-twins.html), tests that involved real money. The goal: See how altruistic they were (how much money did they share with a pro-homeless charity?) and see how risk-tolerant they were (how big does the reward have to be before they’d take a risky gamble?).

Key quote:

So E\>A\>C, a common result. Since economists have spent a fair amount of time arguing for the [social construction of preferences](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=%22peer+effects%22+economics&btnG=Search), it’s good to have some evidence that shared family environment–presumably one important kind of “social construction”–apparently has only a modest association with routine economic preferences.

Note: This is the same group of researchers that found that 40% of “responder” behavior in an [ultimatum game was heritable](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/heritability-of-ultimatum-game.php).

Conclusions: 1. The Swedish Twin Registry is a treasure. 2. Responder behavior (basically, willingness to punish even when it’s expensive to punish) seems about twice as heritable as risk-taking and altruism. We’re only going on two studies here, but that’s an interesting result: Perhaps “Desire for justice/revenge” is more heritable than “Fear of loss” and “Kindness.”
