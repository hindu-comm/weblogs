Who carried out 9/11? Views Differ….

My earlier post which showed that large numbers of people around the world are skeptical about the “official” story regarding the perpetrators of 9/11 really needs an American baseline as a comparison. I have posted data from a [Zogby poll](http://www.911truth.org/images/ZogbyPoll2007.pdf) as well as a [Pew survey](https://pewforum.org/surveys/muslim-american/) of American Muslims. Note that I selected only some of the fields; if the N’s were too low or I found the category uninteresting I left it out (what’s uninteresting? Don’t care if you participate in Little League).

The first theory is the official story, and maintains that 19 Arab fundamentalists executed a surprise attack which caught US intelligence and military forces off guard. The second theory known as Let It Happen argues that certain elements in the US government knew the attacks were coming but consciously let them proceed for various political, military and economic motives; and the third theory Made It Happen contends that certain US government elements actively planned or assisted some aspects of the attacks. Based upon your knowledge of 9/11 events and their aftermath, which theory are you more likely to agree with?*" |                     |                                     |                        |
