Stuff Scientists Like

As I mentioned earlier, I bought the domain [stuffscientistslike.com](http://www.stuffscientistslike.com/), and have set up a minimal weblog, [Stuff Scientists Like](http://www.stuffscientistslike.com/). Iâ€™ll post there now and then, and plan on constructing a quiz similar to the one for Stuff White People Like after I get a large enough list.
