Earthquakes → progress?

[Tectonic environments of ancient civilizations in the eastern hemisphere](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121378035/abstract):

> The map distribution of ancient civilizations shows a remarkable > correspondence with tectonic boundaries related to the southern margin > of the Eurasian plate. Quantification of this observation shows that > the association is indeed significant, and both historical records and > archaeoseismological work show that these civilizations commonly > suffered earthquake damage. Close association of ancient civilizations > with tectonic activity seems to be a pattern of some kind. In the hope > that dividing the civilizations into subsets might clarify the meaning > of this relation, primary and derivative civilizations were compared. > Derivative civilizations prove to be far more closely related to the > tectonic boundaries. Similarly, the civilizations that endured the > longest (and that have been described as most static) are > systematically the farthest from plate boundaries. It is still unclear > how the relation actually worked in ancient cultures, i.e., what aspects of tectonism promoted complexity. Linkages to water and other resources, trade (broadly construed), and societal response seem likely. Volcanism appears not to be involved.
