Female mate preference as a tool, not the hand?

[Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/short/179/4/2091?rss=1):

I think sexual selection is real. Even the more “wild” forms of this, such as the [Handicap Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle), have been theoretically (formally that is) and empirically supported in some circumstances. That being said, too much sexual selection, like stochastic forces in general, emerges as a *deus ex machina* in lieu of a plain admission of ignorance. The question is not does sexual selection occur, but in what contexts and frequencies….
