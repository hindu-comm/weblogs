Insulting religions and races; should it be allowed?

In the United States we have the free speech built into the law, so it is somewhat a moot point. Of course, as evidenced by comments in many other Western countries the limits to speech are bounded by public consensus. So I decided to look at the GSS in terms of response to one question:

> After I read each statement, please tell me if you strongly agree, > aggee, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree with > the statement.  
> a. Under the First Amendment guarnateeing free speech, people should > be allowed to express their own opinions **even if they are harmful or > offensive to members of other religious or racial groups.**

Here is what I foundâ€¦.  
1) Across politics there doesnâ€™t seem to be a strong trend. Extreme liberals do tend to go bimodal where a large minority support speech restriction, but the *N* is small. Interestingly, moderates are the most open to speech restriction. Perhaps because moderates are the least like to need protection because theyâ€™re so inoffensive ðŸ˜‰  
2) A very moderate trend while increasing intelligence and free speech absolutism. But far less than Iâ€™d expected.  
3) A rather noticeable trend toward free speech absolutism from junior college on up in terms of educationâ€¦but the *N* for junior college isnâ€™t large. It seems actually the trend is weaker than Iâ€™d thought it would be here, the less educated arenâ€™t that much more open to speech suppression!  
4) Little difference across races.  
5) Some differences across regions.  
I checked a few other variables. There doesnâ€™t seem to be much difference. Iâ€™m pretty surprised, and happily so! Someone else can check the regression or correlations, but where there are trends the *N*â€˜s are suspiciously small for those categories, so Iâ€™m skeptical that there will be many statistically significant differences. The tables are below the fold.
