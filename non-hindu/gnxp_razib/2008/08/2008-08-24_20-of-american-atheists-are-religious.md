20% of American atheists are religious

A rather pontifical commenter promoted me to do a little digging on the demographics of American atheists, as I was pretty sure that it would reinforce my point about the subjectivity of definitions. The product is a post at my other weblog, [Large minority of atheists are religious](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/large-minority-of-atheists-are.php):

> …20% of atheists in the United States self-identify as a member of a > religion. By atheist, I mean someone who states that they “Do not > believe in God.” 19% of Buddhists are atheists. 10% of Jews. 5% of > Muslims and Hindus. 9% of “Other Faiths.” And of course, 22% of the > Unaffiliated (those without a religious identification). To get to my > 20% number I just went to the Pew [US Religious Landscape > Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/), checked belief in God by > religion and cross-referenced with the proportion within the sample of each religion. I think it’s a rather peculiar situation that the same proportion of atheists are religious as non-religious are atheists! Chart and data below the fold….
