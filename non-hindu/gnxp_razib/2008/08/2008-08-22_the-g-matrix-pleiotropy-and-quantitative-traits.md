The G matrix, pleiotropy and quantitative traits

![gMatrix.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gMatrix.jpg?resize=364%2C248)![gMatrix.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gMatrix.jpg?resize=364%2C248)My previous post, Weird lands of the tails, had some concepts implicit which I didn’t elucidate in detail. For example, I assumed that the speed is a quantitative trait, and the many genes which control its variation have [pleiotropic effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy). That is, gene 1 has effect on phenotypes 1 through *n*. Gene 2 has effect on phenotype 1 through *n*. Speed may be just one of those phenotypes. More formally what I’m thinking about is a genetic variance-covariance matrix, or G matrix. If you keep the G matrix in mind I think it’s kind of ludicrous to expect that speed was actually what was being selected for directly; but that’s just me.  
If you want to know more about the G matrix, [Comparative quantitative genetics: evolution of the G matrix](http://bio.fsu.edu/~dhoule/Publications/steppanetal2002.pdf) is a good paper. Also check out [The multivariate breeder’s equation](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/01/multivariate-breeders-equation.php). There’s a lot of talk about going beyond one-gene models and the retarded concepts which arise from them, but if people are serious about that, well, start looking into quantitative genetics and refine your mental models….
