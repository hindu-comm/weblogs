Global warming = more religion?

I know this paper will make some ScienceBloggers very happy, [Assortative sociality, limited dispersal, infectious disease and the genesis of the global pattern of religion diversity](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/500u4v5207hx3635/fulltext.html):

> Why are religions far more numerous in the tropics compared with the > temperate areas? **We propose, as an answer, that more religions have > emerged and are maintained in the tropics because, through localized > coevolutionary races with hosts, infectious diseases select for three > anticontagion behaviours: in-group assortative sociality; out-group > avoidance; and limited dispersal.** These behaviours, in turn, create > intergroup boundaries that effectively fractionate, isolate and > diversify an original culture leading to the genesis of two or more > groups from one.

There are more religions in the tropics, but I’m not sure they have the causality right. For example, pathogens could lead to lower IQ, which may lead to more religion (there are 1,000 other correlations one could make like this). But with [Toxoplasma gondii](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&q=gondii+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fgnxp%2F&sa=Search) as a prior I’m not willing to dismiss the sort of argument as the one made above on first inspection.
