More subceullular relocalization of a gene duplicate

A little while back, [I mentioned](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/06/rapid-evolution-of-gene-duplicate.php) a paper demonstrating the rapid evolution of a gene duplicate as it was selected for targeting to a novel subcellular location. The same group has apparently been following up a number of these stories–see this [new paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000150) on another example of a retrocopy of a gene acquiring a novel subcellular localization via positive selection in hominids.
