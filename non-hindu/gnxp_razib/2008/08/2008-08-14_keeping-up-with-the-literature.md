Keeping up with the literature

[Pubmed + RSS + iGoogle = Easy Lit Updates](http://bitesizebio.com/2008/08/13/pubmed-rss-igoogle-easy-lit-updates/):

> â€¦The idea is to use the combined power of Pubmed, RSS feeds and > iGoogle to create a page of RSS feed boxes that will keep you > continually updated on articles containing your keywords of interest, or from specific authors or journals.
