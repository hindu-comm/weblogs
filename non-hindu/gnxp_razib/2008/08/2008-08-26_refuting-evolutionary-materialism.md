Refuting evolutionary materialism

**Update:** Please [read](http://anthropology.net/2008/08/26/on-neandertal-stone-tools-estimations-of-their-intelligence/) [Sandman’s](http://anthropology.net/2008/08/26/on-neandertal-stone-tools-estimations-of-their-intelligence/) [response](http://anthropology.net/2008/08/26/on-neandertal-stone-tools-estimations-of-their-intelligence/) after you look over this post….  
[New Evidence Debunks ‘Stupid’ Neanderthal Myth](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080825203924.htm):

The cite is Metin I. Eren, Aaron Greenspan, C. Garth Sampson, *Are Upper Paleolithic blade cores more productive than Middle Paleolithic discoidal cores? A replication experiment*, in **The Journal of Human Evolution.** It isn’t on their [website](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&_tockey=%23TOC%236886%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23&_cdi=6886&_pubType=J&_auth=y&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f221cb1e9d8e4fc26b3d3e12d20e2070) yet. The *ScienceDaily* writeup is a bit clumsy here and almost superfluously dumb there. It could have been about 1/4 as long.  
In any case, sometimes I wish I know more evolutionary anthropology. [John](http://johnhawks.net/weblog) and [Sandman](http://anthropology.net/) have a comparative advantage here. Nevertheless, Henry Harpending told me years ago that the changes in tool type tens of thousands of years ago were not as comprehensible as they might be if they dovetailed perfectly with rise of man the modern. Neandertals had larger cranial capacities than our own species, so that should give us one prior as to why we shouldn’t assume they were much less intelligent than our own kind. Additionally, if we look at our history we note that many times conquests were not achieved through great technological imbalances. The Mongols for example were superior in terms of organization and human capital.¹ Some of the same factors combined with historical contingencies played a role in the Arab expansion and the rise of Islam. Certainly the Spaniards were superior in technology to the natives of the New World, but the 90% declines in population within one generation due to disease susceptibility probably played a greater proximate role in the demographic replacement.  
One could make the case that technological differences only became the preponderant independent variables in conquests and population replacements within the last 500 years. The combination of [Quinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine) and the [Maxim gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) opened up Africa in the late 1800s. Ironically we might be projecting our own Whiggish age and its dominant dynamics back to the prehistorical period!
