Atheist vs. Attend Religious Services Once a Week

A comment:

> In Canada, places in the far west like Alberta and British Columbia > contain a higher percentage of atheists and other non-religious, but > also a higher percentage of evangelical Christians.

This is true in the USA to some extent…but I didn’t want to compare to “evangelical Christians” because the relatively low proportions of evangelicals in the Mountain West and the Northeast are historical artifacts due to their particular religious demography. So I used the same methodology as earlier and plotted the proportion of atheists vs. those who attend religious services at least once a week.
