Open Access Wars, part n

[Reed Elsevier caught copying my content without my permission](http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/08/reed_elsevier_caught_copying_m.php):

> Scientists provide the content for Elsevier’s journals. They donate > their time to review, and often edit, the articles that appear in the > journals. They make up the bulk of the audience for the journals. Yet > Elsevier has, time after time, demonstrated a complete lack of respect > for scientists and the scientific community. It’s not a surprise that they would decide to grab my post, while ignoring my rights to my own material. It’s simply another example of where their focus is: intellectual property matters if and only if it’s theirs.

As they say, read the whole thing….
