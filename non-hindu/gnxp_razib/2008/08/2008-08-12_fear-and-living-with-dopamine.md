Fear and living with dopamine….

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/comtfear-793591.jpg)Another dopamine-related fear and anxiety related gene, [COMT Genetic Variation Affects Fear Processing: Psychophysiological Evidence](http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/bne1224901.pdf). [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080810214000.htm) with the predigested form. Quick points,

1\) It looks like the SNP in question does [show some variation world wide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=4680). Europeans seem to have a higher frequency of the MET/MET genotype than Africans, while Asians tend to be lowest.

2\) I notice that some genes around this locus show up as being under selection in [Haplotter](http://hg-wen.uchicago.edu/selection/haplotter.htm). Within +/- 1.5 megabases.

3\) This locus is implicated in a [lot of other stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechol-O-methyl_transferase#The_val158met_polymorphism).

4\) [Genetic Future’s](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/challenges-of-psychiatric-genetics.html) post [The challenge of psychiatric genetics](http://www.genetic-future.com/2008/07/challenges-of-psychiatric-genetics.html) is probably worth a read if you are interested in these findings.

I don’t have much original to say here that I/we haven’t said before. So I invite you to browse the links below….
