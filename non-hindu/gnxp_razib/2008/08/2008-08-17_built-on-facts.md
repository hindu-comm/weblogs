Built on Facts

Excellent new [physics blog](http://www.scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/), [Built on Facts](http://www.scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/). Highly recommended, though the author of the weblog seems to be a big believer in the [omnipresence of porn](http://js-kit.com/api/static/pop_comments?ref=http://gnxp.com&path=/1914944565617365408/?src=hsr#2538968) (perhaps building upon personal facts?).
