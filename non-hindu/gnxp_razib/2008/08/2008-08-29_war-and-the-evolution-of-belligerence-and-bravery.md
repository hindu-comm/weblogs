War and the evolution of belligerence and bravery

[War and the evolution of belligerence and bravery](http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/265804865t1v2l46/):

> Tribal war occurs when a coalition of individuals use force to seize > reproduction-enhancing resources, and it may have affected human > evolution. Here, we develop a population-genetic model for the > coevolution of costly male belligerence and bravery when war occurs > between groups of individuals in a spatially subdivided population. > **Belligerence is assumed to increase an actor’s group probability of > trying to conquer another group. An actor’s bravery is assumed to > increase his group’s ability to conquer an attacked group.** We show > that the selective pressure on these two traits can be substantial > even in groups of large size, and that they may be driven by two > independent reproduction-enhancing resources: additional mates for > males and additional territory (or material resources) for females. > This has consequences for our understanding of the evolution of intertribal interactions, as hunter-gatherer societies are well known to have frequently raided neighbouring groups from whom they appropriated territory, goods and women.

No time to read it right now, but a follow up to my post War, rape and group selection.
