European population substructure…Finns in the corner again

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/08/500k-snp-europe-wide-study-of-genetic.html) has a [long post](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/08/500k-snp-europe-wide-study-of-genetic.html) on a new paper, [Correlation between Genetic and Geographic Structure in Europe](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4T5BRBK-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=abb22e14103043204d5356530350cfd9). I took the figure and decided to just label the geographic provenance of the primary clusters which emerged when one plotted them along the two largest [dimensions of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector#Factor_analysis) (Y axis is 1st component, X is 2nd component) for easy *gestalt* absorption. To a large extent genetics does seem to follow geography. Obviously the labels for Italy and Spain really underestimate the area these two samples span, so they are meant to be general pointers, not precise indicators of the center of a given cluster. Note Finland…too terrified to join the party I assume?

**Update:** Also, see what [Sandman](http://anthropology.net/2008/08/11/genetic-geographic-and-linguistic-structure-of-european-populations/) sayeth.
