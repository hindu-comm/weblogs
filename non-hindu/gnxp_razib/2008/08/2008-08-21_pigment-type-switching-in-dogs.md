Pigment type-switching in dogs

Reading up on the MC1R, I came across this [nice summary](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;318/5855/1418/DC2) of work [I mentioned before](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/how-to-build-black-dog.php) on the genetics of coat color in the dog. The summary includes the figure below, which is a pretty intuitive illustration of a few of the genes involved in pigment type-switching (ie. production of eumelanin versus pheomelanin). The caption:

> Production of yellow versus black pigment in dogs is controlled by > three genes: Mc1r, Agouti, and CBD103. Dogs carrying wild-type alleles > for all three genes have a yellow coat resulting from Agouti > antagonism of Mc1r signaling in melanocytes (yellow Great Dane, top). > Dogs carrying a loss-of-function mutation at Mc1r have a yellow coat, > regardless of their genotype at Agouti or CBD103 (yellow Labrador > Retriever, middle). Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for Mc1r and Agouti, together with the dominant black allele of CBD103 (KB) have a black coat resulting from the interaction between a beta-defensin and Mc1r (black Curly Coated Retriever, bottom).
