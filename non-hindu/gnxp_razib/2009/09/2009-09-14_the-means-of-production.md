The means of production

[U.S. Is Finding Its Role in Business Hard to Unwind](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/14big.html?pagewanted=print):

> Between financial rescue missions and the economic stimulus program, > government spending accounts for a bigger share of the nation’s > economy — 26 percent — than at any time since World War II. **The government is financing 9 out of 10 new mortgages in the United States.** If you buy a car from General Motors, you are buying from a company that is 60 percent owned by the government.  
> If you take out a car loan or run up your credit card, the chances are good that the government is financing both your debt and that of your bank.  
> And if you buy life insurance from the American International Group, you will be buying from a company that is almost 80 percent federally owned.

The mortgage number really jumps out at me. I’m really tired of Republicans complaining about Barack Obama’s plan for socialism. **We have socialism.** The American government owns a car company and an insurance company. It’s responsible for putting up capital so the construction and real estate industries stay afloat.
