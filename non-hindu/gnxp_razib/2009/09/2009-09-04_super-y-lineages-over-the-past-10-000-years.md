Super Y lineages over the past 10,000 years

[Dienekes posted a bunch of abstracts](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/ashg-2009-abstracts.html) from the [2009 American Society of Human Genetics](http://www.ashg.org/2009meeting/) meeting. This one is of interest in light of [recent posts](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/whos-barbarian-now-empires-of-silk-road.php) on this weblog:

The ancient expansions (8000-10000 years) are over-represented in Indo-European speaking and sedentary farmer populations,and are likely to be the result of the Neolithic transition.

Asymmetries between male and female lineages are always of interest. For example, diversity of Y and mtDNA [correlates well with patrilocality vs. matrilocality](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v29/n1/abs/ng711.html). The idea of “super-male” lineages was mooted by Bryan Sykes several years ago in the wake of the [“Genghis Khan haplotype”](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/05/who-are-descendants-of-genghis-khan.php), though it benefited from particular preconceptions many have about the nature of male genetic reproductive fitness. But it is likely that these dynamics **vary by population due to ecological and/or social parameters.** The time window for the expansion of Y lineages among [Altaic speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages) is very suggestive in light of historical records and archaeological data. It seems that early on (i.e., before 500 BCE) horse-based nomadism was dominated by Indo-Europeans, predominantly Iranians, in Eurasia. In the few centuries before Christ the populations of the eastern steppe, the precursors of Altaic language families, adopted this lifestyle, and to a great extent superseded the Iranian populations across the length and breadth of the non-sedentary zone over the next 1,500 years (the fact that the [Ossetians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossete) are now a people who reside in the Caucasus is illustrative of the great retreat of Iranian peoples on the steppe). I have suggested that there is a winner-take-all dynamic in regards to steppe polities, and I suspect this will be reflected in the genetics of male lineages as well.

\* It is notable that Ireland was to a great extent a pastoralist society during the period of domination by the Ui Neill .
