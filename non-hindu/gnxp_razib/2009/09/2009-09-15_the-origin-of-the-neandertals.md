The origin of the Neandertals

[The origin of Neandertals](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/09/14/0904119106.short?rss=1):

> Western Eurasia yielded a rich Middle (MP) and Late Pleistocene (LP) > fossil record documenting the evolution of the Neandertals that can be > analyzed in light of recently acquired paleogenetical data, an > abundance of archeological evidence, and a well-known environmental > context. Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization > of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the > Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both > glacial and interglacial phases may have played a crucial role in this > event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the > Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and > an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a > major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is > not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of > Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along > the second half of the MP. Although a separation time for the African > and Eurasian populations is difficult to determine, it certainly > predates OIS 11 as phenotypic Neandertal features are documented as > far back as and possibly before this time. It is proposed to use the > term “Homo rhodesiensis” to designate the large-brained hominins > ancestral to H. sapiens in Africa and at the root of the Neandertals > in Europe, and to use the term “Homo neanderthalensis” to designate > all of the specimens carrying derived metrical or non-metrical > features used in the definition of the LP Neandertals.
