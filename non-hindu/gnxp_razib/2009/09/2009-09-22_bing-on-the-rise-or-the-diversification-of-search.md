Bing on the rise, or the diversification of search?

[Bing Keeps Gaining Ground](http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/feeling-lucky/2009/09/22/bing-keeps-gaining-ground):

> For August, Bing’s share of the American search market came in at 9.3 > percent, up from 8.9 percent in July and 8.4 percent in June. Perhaps > more importantly, Bing’s growth didn’t come at the expense of Yahoo > (YHOO), which held steady at 19.3 percent. For the first time, Bing took market share away from Google, which dropped a tenth of a point to 64.6 percent of the market. (AOL was the big loser here, losing a tenth of a point to fade to a dismal 3 percent share.)

I actually stopped using Bing. I liked its UI for many tasks, but Google’s breadth and relevance of results was just superior, and I got tired of having to use Google as a backup when Bing can up with nothing.  
That being said, this seems a real issue:

> In fact, Danny Sullivan has a new HuffPo piece on all the challengers > taking shots at Google, offering new and unusual kinds of search that > appeals to different elements of our online life. Did the power just go out in your neighborhood? Twitter will tell you why a lot faster than Google can. What’s that movie your friend was raving about the other day? A quick Facebook search will get you the answer.

[Pagerank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is great, the customization of preference allowed by social media is really convenient. It seems a structural issue for Google, it has to serve so many different needs (I don’t notice a huge difference when I am logged into my Google account).
