Lesser of two evils?

*The New York Times* has a strange article up, [For Your Health, Froot Loops](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/business/05smart.html?hp=&pagewanted=print), which profiles the controversy around a new health food guideline/endorsement organized by industry which seems somewhat fishy. This part made me laugh out loud:

> Dr. Kennedy, who is not paid for her work on the program, defended the > products endorsed by the program, including sweet cereals. She said > Froot Loops was better than other things parents could choose for > their children.  
> **“You’re rushing around, you’re trying to think about healthy eating > for your kids and you have a choice between a doughnut and a > cereal,”** Dr. Kennedy said, evoking a hypothetical parent in the > supermarket. **“So Froot Loops is a better choice.”**

Are there really parents who regularly consider buying doughnuts as meals for their kids? When I was a kid the rule-of-thumb was that really tasty cereal, like [Honey Smacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Smacks), [Frosted Flakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosted_Flakes), and yes, Fruit Loops, was not the healthiest. In contrast, [Total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_(cereal)) didn’t taste nearly as good. Does the “if kids don’t like too much it’s probably good for them” heuristic not work anymore? Yes, preparing food from scratch takes a long time. But if you’re going by processed stuff, the tastier the more likely there’s a lot of salt, fat and sugar. It really isn’t that hard to eat just one [Wheat Thin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Thins).
