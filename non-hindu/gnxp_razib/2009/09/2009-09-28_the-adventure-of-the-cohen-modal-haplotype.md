The adventure of the Cohen Modal Haplotype

The past 10 years have seen a lot of [ups & downs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron) in the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH) hypothesis, which suggests some veracity to the Biblical narrative whereby the priestly caste status of the Jewish people is passed down patrilineally from Aaron, the brother of Moses. But could there be multiple Aarons? Possibly. [Extended Y chromosome haplotypes resolve multiple and unique lineages of the Jewish priesthood](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19669163):

The point about a number of paternal lineages is a critical part of this paper. Here’s a figure which shows the proportions of Y haplogroups among Jewish populations (the use of the term “Israelite” for a contemporary nationality is novel to me, as they mean what I would have thought would be “Israeli”):

The prevalence of [haplogroup J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_J_(Y-DNA)) is a confirmation of the fact that Jewish male lineages are predominantly Middle Eastern. The concentration of the Cohen among only a few of these haplogroups is also striking, especially the fact that that bias spans both Ashkenazi (European) and non-Ashkenazi Jews. That suggests that a few male lineages monopolized the status of being a Cohen, which one would expect from the cultural practice (whereby sons inherit the status from their fathers), and, that those lineages predate the expansion of Jews and their subsequent diversification in the Diaspora.  
The following table gives a sense of the time depth of these lineages:  
![jewhaplogroup1.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/jewhaplogroup1.png?resize=463%2C476)![jewhaplogroup1.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/jewhaplogroup1.png?resize=463%2C476)  
The numbers above are thousands of years in the past, specifically the points at which the lineages within a haplogroup coalesce to a common ancestor.  
Of course if these are the descendants of Aaron why exactly are their several haplogroups around? One hypothesis could be that J-P58\* is Aaronic, but that other lineages have “introgressed” through “misattributed paternity.” The problem with such a model is that you should then see a modal haplogroup, and a a host of of much lower frequency unrelated haplogroups. As it is, some of the haplogroups, such as J-M410\*, are at very high frequencies. If introgression occurred, it occurred early enough that we can think of the Cohens as a mix of lineages among the early pre-Diaspora priestly caste. But these authors ran some simulations which suggested this may explanation may need some nuance. They contend:

Mutation alone does not provide an explanation for the multiplicity of Cohanim haplogroups, because the ages of most of these haplogroups predate the foundation of the Jewish people.

The logic of this is simple. Within one population over time most lineages will go extinct through random genetic drift, so that the frequency of one lineage will eventually fix at nearly 100% (this is one where is only one “mitochondrial Eve,” the other lineages slowly disappeared). Within several distinct populations which may have some gene flow the dynamics are more complex, as different independent random walks are liable to render different lineages extinct (though without gene flow fixation would occur more quickly).  
Finally, here’s a map of J-P58\*’s frequencies among Middle Eastern populations:
