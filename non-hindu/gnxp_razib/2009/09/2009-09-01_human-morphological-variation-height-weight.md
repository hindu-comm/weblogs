Human morphological variation: height & weight

I have recently mentioned an analogy between the heritability of height & weight. That is, the proportion of variance of the trait which can be explained by variance in the genes. How closely do parents resemble offspring. A new paper in PLoS ONE, [How Humans Differ from Other Animals in Their Levels of Morphological Variation](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0006876), look at how this variation among human populations compares to other animals:

> Animal species come in many shapes and sizes, as do the individuals > and populations that make up each species. To us, humans might seem to > show particularly high levels of morphological variation, but perhaps > this perception is simply based on enhanced recognition of individual > conspecifics relative to individual heterospecifics. We here more > objectively ask how humans compare to other animals in terms of body > size variation. We quantitatively compare levels of variation in body > length (height) and mass within and among 99 human populations and 848 > animal populations (210 species). **We find that humans show low > levels of within-population body height variation in comparison to > body length variation in other animals. Humans do not, however, show > distinctive levels of within-population body mass variation, nor of > among-population body height or mass variation.** These results are > consistent with the idea that natural and sexual selection have > reduced human height variation within populations, while maintaining it among populations. We therefore hypothesize that humans have evolved on a rugged adaptive landscape with strong selection for body height optima that differ among locations.

In other words, it is particularly in the domain of **variance in heights *within* populations where humans are atypical.** The authors suggest that selective forces are driving human populations toward phenotypic optimums, and we inhabit a “rugged adaptive landscape.” That is, in some places it pays to be short, and in others it pays to be tall.
