The introduction of farming & new genes to Europe

[Genetic Discontinuity Between Local Hunter-Gatherers and Central Europe’s First Farmers](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1176869):

> Following the domestication of animals and crops in the Near East some > 11,000 years ago, farming reached much of Central Europe by 7,500 > years before present. The extent to which these early European farmers > were immigrants, or descendants of resident hunter-gatherers who had > adopted farming, has been widely debated. We compare new mitochondrial > DNA (mtDNA) sequences from late European hunter-gatherer skeletons > with those from early farmers, and from modern Europeans. We find > large genetic differences between all three groups that cannot be > explained by population continuity alone. Most (82%) of the ancient > hunter-gatherers share mtDNA types that are relatively rare in Central > Europeans today. Together, these analyses provide persuasive evidence > that the first farmers were not the descendants of local > hunter-gatherers but immigrated into Central Europe at the onset of > the Neolithic.
