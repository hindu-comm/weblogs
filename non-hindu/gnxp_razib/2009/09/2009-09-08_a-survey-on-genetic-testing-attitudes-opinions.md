A survey on genetic testing, attitudes & opinions

If you have a minute, I’d appreciate it if you fill out [this survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=VyrEiqsWm8_2ftJ5_2bvaWT_2bgw_3d_3d), the 6 questions should take 30 seconds (2 optional questions about where you came from to take the survey). This is for a friend’s research project. The results will be posted next week.
