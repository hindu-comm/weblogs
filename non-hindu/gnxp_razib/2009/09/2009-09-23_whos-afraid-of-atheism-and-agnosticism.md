Who's afraid of atheism? (and agnosticism)

“Belonging” refers to people who self-identify as “X.” For example, someone who asserts that they are an atheist. “Belief” refers to the content of one’s avowed beliefs, as opposed to label. Someone who asserts that they “do not believe in God” is placed within the atheist category. As you can see, **many more people avow atheist & agnostic beliefs** than will own up to the terms. “Soft agnostic” refers to those who say they’re not sure about the existence of god, while “hard agnostic” are those who believe there’s no way to find out. “Deist” refers to those who believe i in a “Higher Power,” and “Theist” are conventional believers in a personal God.
