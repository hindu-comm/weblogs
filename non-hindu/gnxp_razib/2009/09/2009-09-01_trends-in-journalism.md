Trends in journalism

[The Worst NYT Trend Story of the Year?](http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/09/the_worst_nyt_trend_story_of_the_year.php):

This is a serious problem. Anecdotes add spice to real data. As illustrations of something **real.** Too often journalism involves finding five people on the street who can agree with whatever “trend” you’ve made up. This reminds of how I was taught to write essays in Middle School, make up a thesis and find **n** facts to support the thesis.
