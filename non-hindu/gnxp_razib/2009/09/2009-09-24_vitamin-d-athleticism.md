Vitamin D & athleticism

[Phys Ed: Can Vitamin D Improve Your Athletic Performance?](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/phys-ed-can-vitamin-d-improve-your-athletic-performance/?pagemode=print):

In a Creighton University study of female naval recruits, stress fractures were reduced significantly after the women started taking supplements of Vitamin D and calcium.

I’ve been wondering about the effects of a sunny Mediterranean climate culturally. I always assumed that people in California and Florida were more athletic because the weather was nice all year, but perhaps there are other factors?
