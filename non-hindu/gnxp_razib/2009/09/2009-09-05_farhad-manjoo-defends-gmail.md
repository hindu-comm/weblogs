Farhad Manjoo defends Gmail

[So Gmail Was Down. Get Over It](http://www.slate.com/id/2227215/):

> So if Gmail is as good as the power grid, the phone network, and home > broadband, why does its failure spark such surprise and outrage–and > always make national headlines…**An online service’s outage, though, > is sudden, inexplicable, and communal.** Gmail goes down for everyone > at the same time, none of us knows why, and because we’re all online > and gabbing, the news spreads fast. Many people also spend a lot more > time on Gmail and other Web services than we do on the phone or > watching TV; even if you don’t really have any pressing reason to be > on e-mail or IM, the idea that someone who needs to talk to you is > unable to get in touch can, in these always-on times, be cause for a > major freak-out. From a technical standpoint, a Web site’s failure may be just a small glitch, but an outage on Gmail, Twitter, or Facebook often feels like a blackout–a major urban event that leaves us all a bit unmoored, flocking to other social networks for group therapy.  
> What’s more, many online companies–Google especially–like to hold > themselves up as being nearly immune to failure. Your local > electricity company rarely boasts about its engineering talent or its > huge and multiply redundant data systems; we’re trained to expect an occasional power outage and be patient when it happens. **But a lot of us simply expect more from Google.** If Gmail were actually down nine hours a year, the tech blogosphere would call it a scandal.

Complex pieces of software or networks are never going to be humming perfectly ***all the time***, but it seems that tech marketing is geared to simply never mention that and assume that you will run into “known issues.” There’s kind of a kabuki-theater aspect to it all. The issue is magnified partly in the case of Google because the company is responsible for a qualitative change in the way we gather information in a very positive sense, the standard is implicitly an unattainable level of perfection.
