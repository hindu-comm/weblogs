Eliezer Yudkowsky staying on Bloggingheads.tv

His two primary [reasons](http://lesswrong.com/lw/17e/why_im_staying_on_bloggingheadstv/):

> 1\) Robert Wright publicly said that this was foolish, apologized for > the poor editorial oversight that led to it, and says they’re going to try never to do this again. This looks sincere to me, and given that it’s sincere, people really ought to be allowed more chance than this to recover from their mistakes.  
> 2) Bloggingheads.TV has given me a forum to debate accomodationist > atheists who are insufficiently condemning of religion – for example > my diavlog with Adam Frank, author of “The Constant Fire”. Adam Frank > argues that, while of course we now know that God doesn’t exist, > nonetheless scientific wonder at the universe and its mysteries has a > lot in common with the roots of religion. And I said this was wishful > thinking, historically ignorant of how religions really arose and > propagated themselves, and a continuation of such theistic bad habits > as thinking that things of which we are temporarily ignorant are “sacred mysteries”. And no one at BHTV complained that I was being too confrontational, or too anti-religious, or that it was unfair to have the diavlog be between two atheists.

I can understand why some would want to distance themselves from BHTV after the recent events. **But there’s no reason that *everyone* of similar mind needs to follow the same strategy.** The flight of Zimmer, Carroll, etc., from BHTV serves as a warning shot, but it still has the potential to be an interesting forum.
