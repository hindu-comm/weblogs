The right-handed ape

Via [Anthropology.net](http://anthropology.net/), [The prehistory of handedness: Archaeological data and comparative ethology](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJS-4X7FRJT-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=7c49fca4dbccebecd739675d3d8f89b1):

The evolutionary background of handedness is of interest because [there are correlates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handedness#Correlations_with_left-handedness) with left-handedness when it comes to individual differences. Handedness can also be somewhat confusing. For example, I am right-handed when it comes to writing (of less relevance today when I generally type). But I am strongly left-handed in basketball, switch-hit in baseball (slower bat speed left), and can throw a football with either arm comfortably (greater strength left, but better touch right, and I tend to side-arm with the left).
