The taste of wine

[Expectations influence sensory experience in a wine tasting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WB2-4VKDMNR-3&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c2152c041fbd8fae3a0ce749ba5a6a13):

> Information about a product may shape consumers’ taste experience. In > a wine tasting experiment, participants received (positive or > negative) information about the wine prior to or after the tasting. > When the information was given prior to the tasting, negative > information about the wine resulted in lower ratings compared to the > group that received positive information. No such effect was observed > when participants received the information after the tasting but > before they evaluated the wine. Results suggest that the information > about the wine affected the experience itself and not only > participantsâ€™ overall assessment of the wine after the tasting.
