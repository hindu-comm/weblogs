Sacred objects as toys

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/) points me to an interesting [article](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/mother-goddess-figurines-theory.html), [Ancient figurines were toys not mother goddess statues, say experts as 9,000-year-old artefacts are discovered](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/09/mother-goddess-figurines-theory.html):

It’s old joke that when archaeologists can’t find a utilitarian slot to put an object, it becomes “sacred” or a religious object. The nature of the sacredness or religiosity of an object as it is perceived may tell us more about the culture in which the archaeologist lives than the ancient society itself (remember those peaceful Maya?).
