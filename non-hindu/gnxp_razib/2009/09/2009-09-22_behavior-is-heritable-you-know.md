Behavior is heritable you know….

[Genes May Explain Why Children Who Live Without Dads Have Earlier Sex](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090915100955.htm):

This issue is known to anyone who has read [Judith Rich Harris’](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/01/10-questions-for-judith-rich-harris.php) [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20). Nevertheless a lot of the psychological and social research published today routinely ignores the possibility of passive gene-environment correlation from what I can tell. Of course heritable propensities express themselves in an environmental context, so for example the rank order of average age of first intercourse among a set of unrelated families may remain the same in a Mormon “treatment” as opposed to a Wicca treatment (this is a thought experiment obviously), but the average age for the two cases would probably differ somewhat.
