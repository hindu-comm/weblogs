Next year a child! Or not….

Earlier this [year](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/02/gnxp-survey-results.php) I put a reader survey. One thing that stuck out was now few children readers of this weblog had. Here’s a comparison with other demographics from the GSS:

|                                                        |            |          |                                |                       |                        |                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Mean Number of Children For Men By For Age Classes** |            |          |                                |                       |                        |                          |
|                                                        |            |          | **GSS, 2000-2008, Males Only** |                       |                        |                          |
| **Age**                                                | **GNXP N** | **GNXP** | **All Males**                  | **Bachelor’s Degree** | **Advanced Degree**    | **Atheists & Agnostics** |
| 18-25                                                  | 84         | 0        | 0.24                           | 0.09                  | (N too small, omitted) | 0.28                     |
| 26-35                                                  | 140        | 0.21     | 1.06                           | 0.53                  | 0.68                   | 0.8                      |
| 36-45                                                  | 97         | 0.9      | 1.79                           | 1.73                  | 1.56                   | 1.29                     |
| 46-65                                                  | 108        | 1.57     | 2.22                           | 1.93                  | 2.06                   | 1.82                     |

Below the fold I’ve broken down by demographic for the GNXP male sample 46-65, which has an N of 108 total (though some questions were omitted for some individuals). I added the political extremes and centers together (e.g., Far Left + Center Left + Left = Left)

|                      |       |                    |       |       |       |       |       |       |                         |

Struck by the fact that GNXP male readers who are upper middle class have more children than those who are middle class (subjective definition of course), and, that those with graduate degrees have more children than those with only undergraduate degrees.
