If you have a slow metabolism, avoid those with fast ones….

Seems to be the upshot of this finding, [I’ll Have What She’s Having: Effects of Social Influence and Body Type on the Food Choices of Others](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/644611):

The influence of [peer groups](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/labels/Origin%20of%20obesity.php) on how you eat, and what you eat, and how much you eat, is obviously an important issue to be investigated. Too much of the discussion of food focuses on individual actions abstracted from ecological context. Environmental cues no doubt reshape the way one implements heuristics which allow for choice, even if there is also an innate individual disposition.
