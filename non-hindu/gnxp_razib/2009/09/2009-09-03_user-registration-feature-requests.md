User registration feature requests

ScienceBlogs is going to be adding user registration. This should be a nice, as I can’t flag certain commenters as approved anymore since the “upgrade.” They’re [taking a poll on features you’d like](http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/09/what_would_you_like_to_see_in.php). I’m keen on a vote/starring system. Some readers have awesome comments. Some do not.
