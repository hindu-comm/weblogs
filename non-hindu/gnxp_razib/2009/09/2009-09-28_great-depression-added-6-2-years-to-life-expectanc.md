Great Depression added 6.2 years to life expectancy

[Life and death during the Great Depression](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/09/28/0904491106):

> Recent events highlight the importance of examining the impact of > economic downturns on population health. The Great Depression of the > 1930s was the most important economic downturn in the U.S. in the > twentieth century. We used historical life expectancy and mortality > data to examine associations of economic growth with population health > for the period 1920-1940. We conducted descriptive analyses of trends > and examined associations between annual changes in health indicators > and annual changes in economic activity using correlations and > regression models. Population health did not decline and indeed > generally improved during the 4 years of the Great Depression, > 1930-1933, with mortality decreasing for almost all ages, and life > expectancy increasing by several years in males, females, whites, and > nonwhites. For most age groups, mortality tended to peak during years > of strong economic expansion (such as 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1936-). In > contrast, the recessions of 1921, 1930-1933, and 1938 coincided with > declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy. The only exception > was suicide mortality which increased during the Great Depression, but > accounted for less than 2% of deaths. Correlation and regression > analyses confirmed a significant negative effect of economic > expansions on health gains. The evolution of population health during the years 1920â€“1940 confirms the counterintuitive hypothesis that, as in other historical periods and market economies, population health tends to evolve better during recessions than in expansions.

Also see [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172530.htm). I guess these papers are seeing the light of day because they’re “relevant” again, but apparently these sorts of counterintuitive data have been an open secret for a while.
