September 11th

I don’t usually say much about September 11th because I don’t have much original to say. Bu I realized recently that to a great extent September 11th was one of the reasons I got into blogging in the spring of 2002. Obviously I don’t talk much about foreign policy or politics in any substantive manner, but in the wake of those events in September the media ecosystem seemed ill-equipped to respond to the changes in the story fast enough, and so non-tech related weblogs arose to fill the vacuum. And arguably that is why you are reading this right now (I actually had a blog for 1 week in the fall of 2001, but I deleted that website after being unsatisfied with what I’d written).  
To be fair, I strongly suspect I have a “blogging personality,” and would have gotten into this habit at some point. But the blogosphere is characterized by “first mover advantage,” so the fact that I started so early has probably resulted in this activity playing a much bigger role in my life than would otherwise be the case.
