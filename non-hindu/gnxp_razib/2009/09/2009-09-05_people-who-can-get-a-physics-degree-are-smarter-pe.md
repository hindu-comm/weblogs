People who can get a physics degree are smarter, period

[Sean Carroll](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/01/a-tip-for-students-interested-in-law-school/) points out that [physics and math degree holders have the highest LSAT scores](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/09/01/a-tip-for-students-interested-in-law-school/). There’s the classic chicken or egg issue implied here: **does physics make you smart, or do only smart people manage to complete a degree in physics?** I think it is more the latter. How individuals in various disciplines do on standardized tests is strongly predicted by mathphobia in said disciplines.
