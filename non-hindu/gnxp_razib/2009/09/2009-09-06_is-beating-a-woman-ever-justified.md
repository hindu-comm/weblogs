Is beating a woman ever justified?

[Global Health Magazine](http://www.globalhealthmagazine.com/screenshots/of_women_who_believe_its_ok_for_husbands_to_hit_them/) has some data up on the “% of women who believe it is OK for husbands to beat them.” If you click through the original [data](http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php), the question is more extensive:

> % of girls and women aged 15-49 who responded that a husband or > partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain > circumstances (2001-2007)

I was going to cross-reference the data with the World Values Survey (which has a similar question), but I don’t have time right now, so I’ll simply pass on the raw data sorted by country. There’s a rather large gap.

The gap between Tajikstan and Kyrgyzstan makes me suspicious, the data are from the same survey so there shouldn’t have been differences in the wording of the question.
