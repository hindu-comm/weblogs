Obesity & ancestry in African Americans

Another study on obesity & Africans, with a slight twist, [Admixture Mapping of Obesity-related Traits in African Americans: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study](http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/oby2009282a.html):

> Obesity is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In > the United States, the prevalence of obesity is higher in African > Americans than whites, even after adjustment for socioeconomic status > (SES). This leads to the hypothesis that differences in genetic > background may contribute to racial/ethnic differences in > obesity-related traits. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a > genome-wide admixture mapping scan using 1,350 ancestry-informative > single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3,531 self-identified blacks > from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used > these markers to estimate the overall proportions of European ancestry > (PEAs) for each individual and then scanned for the association > between PEA and obesity-related traits (both continuous and > dichotomous) at each locus. The median (interquartile range) PEA was > 0.151 (0.115). PEA was inversely correlated with continuous BMI, weight, and subscapular skinfold thickness, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. **In contrast, PEA was positively correlated with BMI-adjusted waist circumference….**

BMI is a coarse measure. The positive correlation between European ancestry and waist circumference shows how genes can shape your body type, even if we’re interested in only slices of information.
