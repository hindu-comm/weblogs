American "Nones", sex differences

[American Religious Identification Survey 2008](http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/2009/09/american_nones_the_profile_of_the_no_religion_population.html) has a new survey, [American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population](http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/2009/09/american_nones_the_profile_of_the_no_religion_population.html). Not surprising, but interesting:

> There are a couple of additional findings worth noting here. Looking > at retention by gender, Nones are more likely to retain men than > women: 66% of men who reported no religion at age 12 were Nones at the > time of their participation in ARIS 2008, but only 47% of females who > reported no religion at age 12 remained Nones. Of those who reported > having a religion at age 12, 15% of men left while only 9% of women > did. It appears that American women have a greater affinity for > religion than men. And conversely men have greater affinity for > secularity than women.

Also, 49% of male “Nones” are atheists & agnostics in terms of stated beliefs. 36% of female “Nones” are. In terms of asserting that one is an atheist or agnostic, 11% of male “Nones” admit to that, while 8% of females do.
