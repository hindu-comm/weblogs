Where the Sexy Ones Are

[Tyler Cowen Alex Tabarok](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/a-theory-for-why-latvian-women-are-beautiful.html) points me to this paper, [Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe](http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf). The abstract:

> The Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI; Simpson & Gangestad 1991) > is a self-report measure of individual differences in human mating > strategies. Low SOI scores signify that a person is sociosexually > restricted, or follows a more monogamous mating strategy. **High SOI > scores indicate that an individual is unrestricted, or has a more > promiscuous mating strategy**. As part of the International Sexuality > Description Project (ISDP), the SOI was translated from English into > 25 additional languages and administered to a total sample of 14,059 > people across 48 nations. Responses to the SOI were used to address > four main issues. First, the psychometric properties of the SOI were > examined in cross-cultural perspective. The SOI possessed adequate > reliability and validity both within and across a diverse range of > modern cultures. Second, theories concerning the systematic > distribution of sociosexuality across cultures were evaluated. Both > operational sex ratios and reproductively demanding environments > related in evolutionary-predicted ways to national levels of > sociosexuality. Third, sex differences in sociosexuality were > generally large and demonstrated cross-cultural universality across > the 48 nations of the ISDP, confirming several evolutionary theories > of human mating. Fourth, sex differences in sociosexuality were > significantly larger when reproductive environments were demanding but were reduced to more moderate levels in cultures with more political and economic gender equality. Implications for evolutionary and social role theories of human sexuality are discussed.

Below is a table of SOIsâ€¦.
