Big banks on track to take down U.S.A. Inc.?

Keep reading stuff like this, [A Year After a Cataclysm, Little Change on Wall St.](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/business/12change.html?pagewanted=print):

This isn’t really an ideological issue. [Arnold Kling](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/09/when_a_fund_bet.html) (who opposed the bailout) has been beating the drums on this issue for a year now. Rather, it is a “stakeholder” vs. non-stakeholder issue. It’s a sign of our institutional sclerosis than the majority seem to agree that there are untenable systemic risks baked into the cake of our current financial-political complex, **but the majority also rate the chance of mitigating the risk through regulation low.** Perhaps the best sign of the lack of change is that employment in the finance sector has declined just 8 percent since last fall. We’re in the full bloom of crony capitalism climax ecosystem.
