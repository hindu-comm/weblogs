Tools to analyze gene expression

[Disease Gene Characterization through Large-Scale Co-Expression Analysis](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008491):

> Celsius, the largest co-normalized microarray dataset of Affymetrix > based gene expression, was used to calculate the correlation between > all possible gene pairs on all platforms, and generate stored indexes > in a web searchable format. The size of Celsius makes UGET a powerful > gene characterization tool. Using a small seed list of known > cartilage-selective genes, UGET extended the list of known genes by > identifying 32 new highly cartilage-selective genes. Of these, 7 of 10 > tested were validated by qPCR including the novel cartilage-specific > genes SDK2 and FLJ41170. In addition, we retrospectively tested UGET > and other gene expression based prioritization tools to identify > disease-causing genes within known linkage intervals. We first > demonstrated this utility with UGET using genetically heterogeneous > disorders such as Joubert syndrome, microcephaly, neuropsychiatric > disorders and type 2 limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) and then > compared UGET to other gene expression based prioritization programs > which use small but discrete and well annotated datasets. Finally, we observed a significantly higher gene correlation shared between genes in disease networks associated with similar complex or Mendelian disorders.
