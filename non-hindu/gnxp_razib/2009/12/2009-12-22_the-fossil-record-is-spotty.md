The fossil record is spotty

[Spatial Organization of Hominin Activities at Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, Israel](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/326/5960/1677):

> The spatial designation of discrete areas for different activities > reflects formalized conceptualization of a living space. The results > of spatial analyses of a Middle Pleistocene Acheulian archaeological > horizon (about 750,000 years ago) at Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, Israel, > indicate that hominins differentiated their activities (stone > knapping, tool use, floral and faunal processing and consumption) > across space. These were organized in two main areas, including > multiple activities around a hearth. The diversity of human activities > and the distinctive patterning with which they are organized implies > advanced organizational skills of the Gesher Benot Ya’aqov hominins.

500,000 years! This could be wrong, who knows? My network of priors in this area is too thin to evaluate the probability (leave it to someone like [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog)). Rather, it is important to remember that the fossil record gets really thin the further back you go. Hominins were never common to begin with, at least before the recent past. There’s a huge fossil gap in China for example between the early *Homo erectus* and the Holocene. I bring this up because John Horgan has been arguing that there’s no evidence for “war” before the rise of agriculture, based on [Brian Ferguson’s research](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~socant/brian.htm). Part of the issue might be how you define war. But another issue might be that this is a case where the sample sizes over time are small enough that you might actually miss a lot.
