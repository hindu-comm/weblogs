When mammoths roamed (rarely)

Brian Switek, [The extended twilight of the mammoths](http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/12/the_extended_twilight_of_the_m.php):

The pattern of extinction was obviously more protracted.

This seems about right. Excuse the analogy, but it sometimes seems that models of human-caused extinction of mega-fauna portray ancient hunter-gatherers as [Einsatzgruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen), and the mega-fauna as Jews and Communists. Though genocides of human populations in the concerted manner of the Germans against the Jews, Gypsies and other groups during World War II have occurred periodically, more often what we see is a slow wearing down and attrition of marginal groups at the expense of dominant ones.  
It seems a plausible model that when mega-fauna were plentiful hunters would focus on them, but once the mega-fauna became rare naturally the return on investment would decrease and it would become rational to shift to other prey organisms. This implies that many mega-fauna likely persisted in isolated pockets as relict populations, and may have been killed off only far later, or perhaps even succumbed to a natural environmental calamity. In another era the last herds of [wild horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przewalski's_Horse) would probably have gone extinct due to drought, or perhaps been hunted down by a random group of humans who had no idea that they were decreasing the biological diversity of the planet.
