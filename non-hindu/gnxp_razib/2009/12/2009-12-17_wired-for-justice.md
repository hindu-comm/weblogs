Wired for justice?

Since my last post was rather pessimistic, I thought I’d point to something a little more cheerful, [Social Scientists Build Case for ‘Survival of the Kindest’](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091208155309.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

Human nature is mixed. There’s a bit of Jekyll and Hyde in everyone, and likely to variant extents as well. But **empirically we know that human competencies are such that we can scale social organizations to an incredibly complex level.** In fact I think evolutionary anthropologists have established with a high degree of certainty that the Hobbesian model of “all against all” is not grounded in the natural history of our species. Rather, we have been a rather groupish lineage for a long time, and recently we have been scaling up the size and complexity of our groups quite a bit.
