Transhuman Goodness

Most of the readers of this weblog probably have as much use for the Singularity as [John Derbyshire](http://johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/085.html), but for those of you who dig [Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/) and [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), you might check out [Transhuman Goodness](https://transhumangoodness.blogspot.com/). The author, Roko Mijic, is so normal he could almost pass as a civilian!
