Louisiana should be the happiest and New York the least

[Objective Confirmation of Subjective Measures of Human Well-Being: Evidence from the U.S.A.](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1180606):

Basically they constructed an index of quality of life based on objective metrics. They then compared how those metrics related to surveyed subjective happiness, and came up with this 50 state scatterplot:  
![happiness.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/happiness.png?resize=500%2C454)![happiness.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/happiness.png?resize=500%2C454)  
The correlation being \~0.6, that means that 36% of the variation of of subjective assessments of life satisfaction can be predicted by the variation in on the presumed predictors of happiness. Note that underlying demographic variables are controlled here. As I said above, Louisiana is ranked so that it should be the happiest state while New York the least. Here’s the full list of 50 states:
