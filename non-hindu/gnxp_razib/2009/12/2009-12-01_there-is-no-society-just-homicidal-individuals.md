There is no society, just homicidal individuals

There’s a new book out, [American Homicide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674035208/geneexpressio-20), which has [some interesting arguments](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091201111204.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+sciencedaily+(ScienceDaily:+Latest+Science+News)&utm_content=Google+Reader):

The main issue I have with the explanations for crime variance out there is that the 1960s spike and the 1990s abatement were synchronous internationally. So I’m skeptical of policy changes being the ultimate cause of these cycles.
