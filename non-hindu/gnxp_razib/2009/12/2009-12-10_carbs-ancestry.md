Carbs & ancestry

[Stable Patterns of Gene Expression Regulating Carbohydrate Metabolism Determined by Geographic Ancestry](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008183):

> **Methodology/Principal Findings**  
> Using a combination of genetic/genomic and bioinformatics approaches, > we identified a large number of genes that were both differentially > expressed between American subjects self-identified to be of either > African or European ancestry and that also contained single nucleotide > polymorphisms that distinguish distantly related ancestral > populations. Several of these genes control the metabolism of simple carbohydrates and are direct targets for the SREBP1, a metabolic transcription factor also differentially expressed between our study populations. >
> **Conclusions/Significance**  
> These data support the concept of stable patterns of gene > transcription unique to a geographic ancestral lineage. Differences in > expression of several carbohydrate metabolism genes suggest both > genetic and transcriptional mechanisms contribute to these patterns and may play a role in exacerbating the disproportionate levels of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease observed in Americans with African ancestry.
