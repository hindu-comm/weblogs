Africans Americans mostly West African, but some mostly European

I referenced a paper in PNAS yesterday, and I thought it might be good to actually point to it today. There’s nothing *that* new in the paper. It confirms the finding that \~20% of the ancestry of African Americans is European, and, that African ancestry seems to be much more dominant when it comes to components of the genome presumably disproportionately contributed by females (2/3 of X chromosomes). In any case, the paper, [Genome-wide patterns of population structure and admixture in West Africans and African Americans](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/10/0909559107.short?rss=1):

One of the value-adds from this paper is that the authors explored how African Americans related to disparate African populations. The historical records indicate that American slaves arrived disproportionately from the regions to the west of the [Bight of Bonny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_of_bonny). In other words, black Americans derive predominantly from the non-Bantu populations of West Africa, from Senegal down to Nigeria. This is in contrast to Brazil, where the black population was reputedly of more diverse origin, including many Bantu speakers from Angola as well as West Africans.  
I reedited part of figure 1 to show which African groups are in the study and how they relate to each other genetically:

That the [Fulani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulani) are atypical in this set of populations is not that surprising. They clearly have some Eurasian connections, including the a Eurasian version of the lactase persistence. The historical background behind this is also easy to pinpoint, the [Almoravid domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid) spanned southern Spain to the Sahel, while more generally the [Tuareg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg) and Islamic orders helped mediate gene flow north and south of the Sahara.  
But even without the Fulani there is still some genetic variation which maps onto to ethno-cultural clusters. Along one axis seems to be the “Bantu Expansion,” which scholars presume originated in eastern Nigeria. The second axis seems to point to a difference between West African & Bantu groups, and Nilo-Saharan groups. The differences are also evident in a FRAPPE derived plot. Again, K = \# of putative ancestral groups:  
![africangroups2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/africangroups2.png?resize=500%2C567)![africangroups2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/africangroups2.png?resize=500%2C567)  
Panel A opens up the floor to a lot of discussion on how the Hausa identity in particular emerged, and the historical processes which led to the current Fulani genetic relationships. The Fulani language belongs to the [Niger-Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger-Congo_languages) group, along with the Yoruba, Igbo and all the Bantu dialects. The Hausa language is [Afro-Asiatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-asiatic), like Arabic and Hebrew. But more importantly, the genetic structure seems explicable in light of the PC charts.  
This is important because of panel’s E & F. Note the lack of variance of the “blue” component of ancestry among African Americans, which resembles what you see among the Yoruba. So it seems that African American ancestry which is non-European is from groups like the Yoruba genetically, by and large. Also, K = 4 seems to suggest that African American European ancestry is mostly from the populations of northern Europe, which comports what the historical record, as southern European waves of immigration generally post-date the ethnogenesis of a black American identity.  
Here’s a PC chart from figure 2 which shows how African Americans relate to the various groups above:

The authors conclude:
