Africa's urban poor becoming obese

Yeah, you read that right. [Overweight and obesity in urban Africa: A problem of the rich or the poor?](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/465/abstract):

> Descriptive results showed that the prevalence of urban > overweight/obesity increased by nearly 35% during the period covered. > The increase was higher among the poorest (+50%) than among the > richest (+7%). Importantly, there was an increase of 45-50% among the > non-educated and primary-educated women, compared to a drop of 10% > among women with secondary education or higher. In the multivariate > analysis, the odds ratio of the variable time lapse was 1.05 > (p\<0.01), indicating that the prevalence of overweight/obesity > increased by about 5% per year on average in the countries in the > study. While the rate of change in urban overweight/obesity did not significantly differ between the poor and the rich, it was substantially higher among the non-educated women than among their educated counterparts.

Hereâ€™s a chart showing the urban/rural difference by nation:

This is a problem in a specific sense; obesity tends to increase morbidity. **But it also points to a bigger general positive development, the nutritional plentitude of the modern era.**
