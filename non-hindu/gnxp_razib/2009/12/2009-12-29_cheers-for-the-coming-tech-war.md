Cheers for the coming tech-war!

[Google, Past and Future](http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/feeling-lucky/2009/12/29/google-past-and-future):

This sort of competition is good for consumers. I think only a company with Google’s prestige can convince many purchasers of Office that its price point is a relict of the 1990s and the era of shrink-wrapped software. Free is probably not viable (or at least not exclusively), but there’s no natural reason that Microsoft *has* to reap the margins it currently does.
