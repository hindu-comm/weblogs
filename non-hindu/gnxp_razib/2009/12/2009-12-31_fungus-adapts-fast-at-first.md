Fungus adapts fast…at first

[The Properties of Adaptive Walks in Evolving Populations of Fungus](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000250):

In practical terms, our results suggest that the bulk of adaptation is likely to be accomplished within the first few steps.**

I’ve discussed this issue before. The general logic here is that when a population is subject to new selection pressures it uses whatever tricks and tools are handy in the short term even if they’re suboptimal in the long term. Over time adaptation should “refine” the phenotype so that there are fewer trade-offs so that fitness gradually converges upon an idealized peak. Consider the various malaria adaptations, which arose in the past 5,000 years, some of which still have major side effects such as sickle cell anemia in homozygotes. But **in a malarial environment the side effects, the risk of morbidity and mortality, is worth the overall the reduction in mortality.** One imagines that over time new mutations would emerge to mask the deleterious consequences of new adaptations, which are basically evolutionary kludges.  
They illustrate this process experimentally:

The later tend to have smaller effects. Though note that there is variation, so not all lineages recapitulated the trajectory of others. To the left is the full distribution of selection coefficients. These populations were obviously subject to a lot of selection experimentally, coefficients on the order of 0.10 are crazy. In the discussion they point out some interesting dynamics in relation to population size:

Importantly, even in our small bottleneck treatment, N is unlikely to be so low as to prevent sampling of a large number of single-step mutations, as required by theory

Remember that all things equal small populations are much subject to stochastic factors, and so selection can be swamped out. These populations are also “mutation limited,” which means the larger populations have an advantage over the long term.  
The authors conclude:

More fundamentally, the picture emerging from these experiments > is that adaptive evolution in mutation-limited populations can be readily understood from rather simple models that, because they are largely based on the statistical properties of extreme events, are likely to be robust to biological details.

Over at [Pleiotropy](https://pleion.blogspot.com/2009/12/adaptation-is-fast-and-effective-in.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+ResearchBloggingBiologyEnglish+(Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Biology)&utm_content=Google+Reader) there is emphasis on the practical implications of this study:

> One pleasant surprise is that the different lineages clearly did not > evolve the same way.

Rather, from figure 2 we can see that fitness was increased > in many different ways, and with differing results.

Instead, there are many different ways to increase fitness, and further, only some include re-evolving fungicide sensitivity (only five lineages re-evolved sensitivity).  
> I say this is a pleasant surprise because my own work with simulations > suggest that fitness landscapes – which is a property of both genotype > and environment – are likely to evolve to become epistatic. **However, > it is bad news for fighting resistant strains in general, because if the strains occupy a rugged area of the fitness landscape,** they can increase their growth rate without losing their immunity to the fungicide/antibiotic/other drug.

No one ever said evolution was always comforting….
