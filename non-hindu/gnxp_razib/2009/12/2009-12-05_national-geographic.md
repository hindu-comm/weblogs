National Geographic

[Press release](http://seedmediagroup.com/docs/SB-NG%20Partnership%20FINAL.pdf) on the partnership with ScienceBlogs^(TM). Nothing should change around these parts, though I might avail myself of the image library instead of going to Wikipedia all the time. When I was a kid I will admit though that reading issues of National Geographic from 1910 or 1920 was one of my more bizarre pleasures; it was a bit of an anthropological exercise, with the irony being the target was itself anthropology.
