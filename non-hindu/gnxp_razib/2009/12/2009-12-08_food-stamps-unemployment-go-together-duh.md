Food stamps & unemployment go together (duh)

Derek Thompson at [The Atlantic](http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/12/are_americas_fattest_states_also_the_most_jobless.php) has a post [Are America’s Fattest States Also the Most Jobless?](http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/12/are_americas_fattest_states_also_the_most_jobless.php). The county-level data on unemployment only goes back to 2008 (at least that I can find online). But I do have data on obesity at the county-level too. What’s the correlation? 0.32. Pretty modest. If I correlate for white obesity it goes down a little, 0.23 (though remember that I estimated white obesity, so be cautious about this). Since I also have food stamp utilization data I looked at that. Correlation is 0.56. If you think of this as r-squared, how much of variance of Y can be explained by X by squaring the correlation, it’s a much stronger association. I constructed a quick regression where % unemployed on the county-level was the dependent variable, and % black, obese, median household income and % on food stamps were the independents. **Except for food stamps none of these variables generated statistically significant [beta coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_coefficient).** In other words, regional level differences in unemployment in 2008 which tracked obesity are probably best explained as emerging out of a general poverty factor (though do note that median household income itself isn’t very predictive once % on food stamps gets put into the equation).

I don’t doubt that all things equal the obese would be fired first. That being said, all things are often not equal.

**Update:** I realized I left something out. Looking at the correlation college degree holding on the county-level and unemployment in 2008, I found it to be -0.43. So I popped that into the regression, and here are the coefficients with standard errors (all statistically significant):

Black 1.20987610 (0.33416977)  
**College Degree -7.64273043 (0.62394667)**  
Percent on Food Stamps 0.14095962 (0.00946762)  
Median Household Income 0.00002967 (0.00000523)  
Obesity -0.06840311 (0.01494881)

I’ll let readers wonder what’s going on here, though I assume it has something to do with the changes in the education premium and such with globalization.
