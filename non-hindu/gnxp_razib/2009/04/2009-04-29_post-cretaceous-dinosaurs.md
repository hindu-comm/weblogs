Post-Cretaceous Dinosaurs

[New Geochronologic And Stratigraphic Evidence Confirms The Paleocene Age Of the Dinosaur-Bearing Ojo Alamo Sandstone And Animas Formation In The San Juan Basin, New Mexico and Colorado](http://palaeo-electronica.org/2009_1/149/index.html):

> …An assemblage of 34 skeletal elements from a single hadrosaur, found > in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone in the southern San Juan Basin, provided > conclusive evidence that this assemblage could not have been reworked > from underlying Cretaceous strata. In addition, geochemical studies of > 15 vertebrate bones from the Paleocene Ojo Alamo Sandstone and 15 bone > samples from the underlying Kirtland Formation of Late Cretaceous > (Campanian) age show that each sample suite contained distinctly > different abundances of uranium and rare-earth elements, indicating > that the bones were mineralized in place soon after burial, and that > none of the Paleocene dinosaur bones analyzed had been reworked.

Here’s [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090428092823.htm) with more:

Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. Nevertheless, from what little I know lineages tend to predate and postdate the last extant fossils at any given time. This probably explains some of the periodic discrepancies between fossils and molecular evolution clocks.
