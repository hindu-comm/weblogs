Mike Lynch elected to NAS

See the [press release](http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/10740.html). [Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934812/geneexpressio-20/) and [The Origins of Genome Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934847/geneexpressio-20/) are excellent books (though set aside some time if you want to tackle the first).
