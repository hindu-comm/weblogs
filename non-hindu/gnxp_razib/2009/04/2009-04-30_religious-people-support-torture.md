Religious people support torture

[John Schwenkler](http://johnschwenkler.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/christians-conservatives-and-torture/) points me to [Rod Dreher’s](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/04/christians-and-torture-shocker.html) shock that religious people [seem to support](https://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=156) torture more than the non-religious:

> And get this: the more often you go to church, the more pro-torture you’re likely to be!  
> What on earth are these Christians hearing at church?! Very sad indeed.

[John](http://johnschwenkler.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/christians-conservatives-and-torture/) notes:

> There are plenty of data showing that Christians’ attitudes toward > abortion, contraception, and the rest don’t differ very significantly > from those of the rest of society; the real factor, of course, lies in > political affiliations, and I have little doubt that most of the relevant findings can be explained in terms of the fact that frequently churchgoing Catholics and Evangelicals are especially likely to identify as Republicans.  
> “What on earth are these Christians hearing at church?!” asks Rod. **Perhaps it’s had something to do with there being a moral obligation to support the GOP in the face of the Democratic menace.**

There isn’t any question about torture in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08), but there are questions about abortion and the death penalty. I selected 2 with large sample sizes, CAPPUN and ABANY, and checked how they relate to 4 religious identities, Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and None.  
**So on the Death Penalty**:

> Do you favor or oppose the death enalty for persons convicted of murder?

**And on Abortion:**

> Please tell me whether or not you think it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtaina legal abortion if: The woman wants it for any reason?

Politics & religion matter shaping opinions. But to me it looks like religion has a much stronger independent effect on abortion than the death penalty. If I had to bet, I think torture would be more like death penalty.
