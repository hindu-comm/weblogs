Women can smell men…so what?

[Women May Be Sniffing Out Biologically-relevant Information From Underarm Sweat](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090407074945.htm):

So women have a better sense of smell, and, they do not smell as powerfully. Here’s the original paper, [Cross-adaptation of a model human stress-related odour with fragrance chemicals and ethyl esters of axillary odorants: gender-specific effects](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122308983/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

That’s a mouthful. But suspect that the researchers are trying to hook into the work which shows the correlation between MHC, odor and attraction. But I wonder if there’s a straightforward non-adaptive developmental explanation to this? I know that testosterone can have all sorts of deleterious physiological consequences (e.g., depress the immune system). Looking at individual differences among women might suggest possibilities.
