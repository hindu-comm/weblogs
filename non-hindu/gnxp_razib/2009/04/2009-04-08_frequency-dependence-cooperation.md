Frequency dependence & cooperation

[Snowdrift game dynamics and facultative cheating in yeast](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature07921.html):

> The origin of cooperation is a central challenge to our understanding > of evolution…The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated > in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest > in microbial models of cooperation…and competition…For the budding > yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide > must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase…This hydrolysis > reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space > between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate > that the vast majority (99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by > sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the > cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative > behaviour…A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is > able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type > cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the > wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. > **Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two > strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare > strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what > game theorists call the snowdrift game**…A model of the cooperative > interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of > this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition > by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration > in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift gameâ€”wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells.

From [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090406132056.htm):

> Studies have shown that in the wild, yeast carry different numbers of copies of the invertase gene. **This genetic diversity in the wild may be similar to the long-term coexistence of cooperators and cheaters observed in the laboratory**, says Gore.
