The rise of empirical economics

In the wake of my post on *Predictably Irrational*, [The Last Temptation of Risk](http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=21274):

> THE GREAT Credit Crisis has cast into doubt much of what we thought we > knew about economics. We thought that monetary policy had tamed the > business cycle. We thought that because changes in central-bank > policies had delivered low and stable inflation, the volatility of the > pre-1985 years had been consigned to the dustbin of history; they had > given way to the quaintly dubbed “Great Moderation.” We thought that > financial institutions and markets had come to be self-regulating–that > investors could be left largely if not wholly to their own devices. > Above all we thought that we had learned how to prevent the kind of > financial calamity that struck the world in 1929.  
> …  
> The late twentieth century was the heyday of deductive economics. > Talented and facile theorists set the intellectual agenda. Their very > facility enabled them to build models with virtually any implication, > which meant that policy makers could pick and choose at their > convenience. Theory turned out to be too malleable, in other words, to > provide reliable guidance for policy.  
> In contrast, **the twenty-first century will be the age of inductive > economics, when empiricists hold sway and advice is grounded in > concrete observation of markets and their inhabitants.** Work in > economics, including the abstract model building in which theorists > engage, will be guided more powerfully by this real-world observation. > It is about time.

The author is an economist, so if this is a caricature, it’s from the inside….
