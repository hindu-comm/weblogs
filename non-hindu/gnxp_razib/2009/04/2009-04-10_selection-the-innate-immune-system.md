Selection & the innate immune system

[Signatures of natural selection are not uniform across genes of innate immune system, but purifying selection is the dominant signature](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/04/09/0811357106.short?rss=1):

[Purifying selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizing_selection) presumably suggests that the variants on many of these genes are fitness optimized, as new variants are quickly removed from the population due to their low fitness. Nevertheless the differences between populations, and form chimps, would indicate periodic pulses of positive selection fixing new favorable variants.
