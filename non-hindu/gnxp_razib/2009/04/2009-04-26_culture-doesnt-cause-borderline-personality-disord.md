Culture doesn't cause borderline personality disorder

Thankfully. [Familial Resemblance of Borderline Personality Disorder Features: Genetic or Cultural Transmission?](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005334):

> Borderline personality disorder is a severe personality disorder for > which genetic research has been limited to family studies and > classical twin studies. **These studies indicate that genetic effects > explain 35 to 45% of the variance in borderline personality disorder > and borderline personality features.** However, effects of > non-additive (dominance) genetic factors, non-random mating and > cultural transmission have generally not been explored. In the present > study an extended twin-family design was applied to self-report data > of twins (N = 5,017) and their siblings (N = 1,266), parents (N = > 3,064) and spouses (N = 939) from 4,015 families, to estimate the > effects of additive and non-additive genetic and environmental > factors, cultural transmission and non-random mating on individual > differences in borderline personality features. Results showed that > resemblance among biological relatives could completely be attributed > to genetic effects. Variation in borderline personality features was > explained by additive genetic (21%; 95% CI 17-26%) and dominant > genetic (24%; 95% CI 17-31%) factors. Environmental influences (55%; > 95% CI 51-60%) explained the remaining variance. Significant > resemblance between spouses was observed, which was best explained by phenotypic assortative mating, but it had only a small effect on the genetic variance (1% of the total variance). **There was no effect of cultural transmission from parents to offspring.**

The book Evil Genes focused to a large extent on BPD. Here are some correlations across relatives for this trait:
