An "Islamic" nation into the EU?

I’ve suggested before that the idea of Turkey entering the EU is a farce. One could make the economic case that it is far too large **and** poor to be absorbed easily (unlike the Eastern European nations Turkey is nearly as populous as Germany). But there is a strong cultural case too. Turkey is a very religious nation in a European context. It is more Creationist than the United States. Though Turkey is secular for a Muslim nation, it is not secularfor a European nation. But many people seem to be intent on accusing Europeans of racism or discrimination based on their evident disinclination to let Turkey into the club. But I have a relatively anodyne tokenist solution. There is a society which which is culturally Muslim, Turkish, and likely just as secular as most European nations. Additionally it has 1/10th the population of Turkey.  
Last year [Gallup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Europe#Gallup_poll_2007-2008) asked people in various nations, “Does religion occupy an important place in your life?” Below are the percentages who answered “no”:

Estonia 84%  
Denmark 80%  
Norway 78%  
**Azerbaijan 74%**
