The genetic architecture of different populations

Dan MacArthur has a post, [Genetics of complex traits in Europeans and East Asians: similarities and differences](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/04/genetics_of_complex_traits_in.php):

> With those goals in mind, you can expect to see many more GWAS of > non-European populations over the next couple of years, and some > explicit comparisons of the differing genetic architecture of complex traits between populations. Exciting times for those of us interested in the genetic and evolutionary basis of between-population differencesâ€¦

This reminds me of [A variant of the gene encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase confers ethnicity-specific risk of myocardial infarction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282974?dopt=Abstract):

> Variants of the gene ALOX5AP (also known as FLAP) encoding > arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein are known to be > associated with risk of myocardial infarction. Here we show that a > haplotype (HapK) spanning the LTA4H gene encoding leukotriene A4 > hydrolase, a protein in the same biochemical pathway as ALOX5AP, > confers modest risk of myocardial infarction in an Icelandic cohort. > Measurements of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production suggest that this > risk is mediated through upregulation of the leukotriene pathway. > Three cohorts from the United States also show that HapK confers a > modest relative risk (1.16) in European Americans, but it confers a > threefold larger risk in African Americans. About 27% of the European > American controls carried at least one copy of HapK, as compared with > only 6% of African American controls. Our analyses indicate that HapK > is very rare in Africa and that its occurrence in African Americans is > due to European admixture. **Interactions with other genetic or environmental risk factors that are more common in African Americans are likely to account for the greater relative risk conferred by HapK in this group.**
