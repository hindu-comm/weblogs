Killing of apostates in context

[Chaplain’s E-mail Sparks Controversy](http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=527653):

> In a private e-mail to a student last week, Abdul-Basser wrote that > there was “great wisdom (hikma) associated with the established and > preserved position (capital punishment \[for apostates\]) and so, even > if it makes some uncomfortable in the face of the hegemonic modern > human rights discourse, one should not dismiss it out of hand.”  
> …  
> “I believe he doesn’t belong as the official chaplain,” said one > Islamic student, who asked that he not be named to avoid conflicts > with Muslim religious authorities. “If the Christian ministers said > that people who converted from Christianity should be killed, don’t > you think the University should do something?”  
> …  
> Abdul-Basser wrote in a later e-mailed statement that he “never > expressed the position that individuals who leave Islam or convert > from Islam to another religion must be killed. I do not hold this > opinion personally.” He explained that he was not advocating for the > positions mentioned in his e-mail, but rather “addressing them in the > context of the evolution of an Islamic legal doctrine.”
