On the Origin of African Pygmies, follow up 2

Another response by Etienne Patin, lead author of [Inferring the Demographic History of African Farmers and Pygmy Hunter-Gatherers Using a Multilocus Resequencing Data Set](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000448), to a follow up post:

Interestingly, Bantu communities living far from present-day locations of Pygmies know these myths (but this can be due to Bantu spatial migrations).

Alas, it seems that human remains are going to be unlikely due to the climate of the region. Nevertheless, I would add that as the density of knowledge increases about the manner in which human populations arrange themselves, and the distribution of diversities of demographic histories, we can perhaps modulate our expectation about the plausibility of two alternative hypotheses whose likelihood can not be directly ascertained. In other words, some demographic scenarios may turn out to be far more common than others.  
Thanks to Etienne Patin for responding and elaborating.
