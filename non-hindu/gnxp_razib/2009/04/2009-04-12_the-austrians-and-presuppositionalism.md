The Austrians and presuppositionalism

[Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ar/awful_others/) makes an analogy between [Austrian economics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ar/awful_others/) and Calvinist [presuppositionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presuppositional_apologetics). I’ve turned off comments, so you can comment there. Especially see [Robin Hanson’s comment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ar/awful_austrians/71c#comments). When I expressed skepticism of [rationality](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/04/in-defense-of-rationality.php), this is part of what I was talking about. Deduction gets you only so far, mostly because humans are stupid and imprecise.
