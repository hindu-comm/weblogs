New model organisms

Nature has [a nice piece](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090408/full/458695a.html) on the uses of alternative model organisms in various parts of biology. The focus is on the medical applications of these models, which I suppose is due to issues with funding. But the real message is that with novel genomics applications (mainly high-throughput sequencing), understanding the genetics of a wide variety of nature’s bizarre creatures is possible. Sure, understanding how the Antarctic icefish adapted to sub-zero temperatures might in theory help understanding of some human disease, but let’s be honest–that’s worth studying just because it’s really cool.
