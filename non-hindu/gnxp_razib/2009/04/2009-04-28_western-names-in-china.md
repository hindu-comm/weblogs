Western names in China

[The Name’s Du Xiao Hua, But Call Me Steve](http://www.slate.com/id/2217001/):

> Given the nationalism I’ve witnessed in China, I was a bit surprised > at how readily Chinese adopted Western names. (Even my Americanized > parents were uncomfortable with the idea of me changing my name. They > said I could do as I wished when I turned 18, though always in a tone > that suggested such an unfilial act would cause them to die of > disappointment.) But Duthie’s participants insisted that taking an > English name isn’t kowtowing, nor is it simply utilitarian. Rather, > it’s essential to being Chinese and achieving Chinese goals. Whereas > in the past patriotism was expressed by self-sacrifice, it is now > expressed through economic activity. So by working for, say, 3M, > Chinese citizens are helping to build up China, and the English names they take on in the process are as patriotic as Cultural Revolution-era monikers like Ai Guo (Loves China) or Wei Dong (Mao’s Protector).

The author is a Chinese American. In [Peter Turchin’s model](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/cliodynamics-rise-fall-of-empires-and.php) borderlands tend to generate the level of social cohesion necessary for a dynamic civilization-state, while the “heartland” exhibits more anomie and decay. But another aspect of this is that Diasporas often exhibit some element of stasis; as if they enter into a cultural chrysalis. The Chinese case is particularly instructive, as due to the upheavals of Marxism, the Cultural Revolution, and now the unbridled capitalistic ethos, much of traditional China has gone by the wayside. Rather, archaic forms and rites are preserved in the Overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, in Taiwan or even in the United States. Chinese in China naturally have less of a need to assert their “authenticity,” so why not adopt what needs to be adopted?
