African Pygmies & their origins

There was some talk about Pygmies on the [post about Jerry Coyne’s weblog](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/03/jerry-coyne-is-blogging.php). PLoS Genetics has a [new paper up](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000448) on the topic of Pygmy origins and their relationship to non-Pygmy populations. I’ve [blogged it over at ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/04/the_ancient_origins_of_african.php).
