Cryptic variation & melanoma risk

One of the funnier aspects of the discovery of genes correlated with physical traits is that finding the genetic variant which explains 75% of the variation in blue eyes is interesting, but it isn’t as if you now have a better way to find blue eyed people (though it is important for forensic work). But now there is apparently working on looking at pigmentation genes and how they effect melanoma risk in a manner which isn’t visible to the eye: [Dark Hair? Don’t Burn? Your Genes May Still Put You At Risk For Melanoma](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090421101621.htm):

[MC1R is melanocortin 1 receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_1_receptor), and it’s involved in pigmentation pathways. In fact its importance was known well before most of the newer loci yielded by genomic techniques. There are particular variants which are associated with red hair, for example. Additionally in Europeans it is very polymorphic, with a host of different loss of function mutations floating around. It seems likely that these data point to cryptic phenotypic variation which clinical assessment through visual inspection isn’t picking up. In other words, coarse binning into categories like “dark hair” and “normal complexion” don’t reflect the variation even within those categories. I may be that people on the fairer side of normal are at particular risk because doctors don’t think to warm them to take precautions, as they would someone with red hair.
