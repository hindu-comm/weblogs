H. sapiens sapiens give birth differently

[Neandertal birth canal shape and the evolution of human childbirth](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/04/17/0812554106.short?rss=1):

> Childbirth is complicated in humans relative to other primates. Unlike > the situation in great apes, human neonates are about the same size as > the birth canal, making passage difficult. The birth mechanism (the > series of rotations that the neonate must undergo to successfully > negotiate its mother’s birth canal) distinguishes humans not only from > great apes, but also from lesser apes and monkeys. Tracing the > evolution of human childbirth is difficult, because the pelvic > skeleton, which forms the margins of the birth canal, tends to survive > poorly in the fossil record. Only 3 female individuals preserve fairly > complete birth canals, and they all date to earlier phases of human > evolution. Here we present a virtual reconstruction of a female > Neandertal pelvis from Tabun, Israel. The size of Tabun’s > reconstructed birth canal indicates that childbirth was about as > difficult in Neandertals as in present-day humans, but the canal’s > shape indicates that Neandertals had a more primitive birth mechanism. > **A significant shift in childbirth apparently occurred quite late in > human evolution, during the last few hundred thousand years.** Such a late shift underscores the uniqueness of human childbirth and the divergent evolutionary trajectories of Neandertals and the lineage leading to present-day humans.
