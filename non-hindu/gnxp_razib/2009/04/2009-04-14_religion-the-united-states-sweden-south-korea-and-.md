Religion, the United States, Sweden, South Korea and Japan

It turns out that the [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) has a decent web interface, rather like the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08). As an exercise I thought I would compare 4 nations when it came to religious attitudes, the United States, Sweden, South Korea and Japan. The United States because most readers are American. Sweden because it is the apotheosis of European secularity. Japan because it is generally presumed to be an apathetic non-Western nation when it comes to religion. And South Korea, which [sends more Christianity missionaries than any nation aside from the United States](http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html). The data for South Korea are usually a revelation for Americans, as we are conditioned by the dominant role of conservative Protestantism among our own ethnic Korean population, it is somewhat of a surprise when digging into the data to note that Korea is a much more secular nation than the United States.

The data are open to many interpretations. You can actually do more fine-grained analysis, but I’ll leave that for the readers. I would say:

1\) South Koreans are more religious than the Japanese, but also just as starkly they are more polarized. Look at the first table and how many Koreans asserted that they were convinced atheists, as opposed to the more mellow Japanese and Swedes. Japan and Sweden are clearly more secular than South Korea, but since [religious controversy](http://barthsnotes.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/buddhist-rally-in-south-korea-over-claims-of-christian-bias/) isn’t a feature of their public life, atheism vs. theism is less of an issue.

2\) From a Western perspective the American & Swedish data are rather easy to interpret. The high rates of Swedish affiliation despite their secularity is simply due to the history of the established Lutheran church in that nation (only recently disestablished last I checked), and the customary attachment which most Swedes have to the institution. Aside from that, Sweden is secular and the United States not so much. South Korea and Japan are harder to interpret. Despite being very secular Japan is obviously rather conservative when it comes to many social mores, and Korea exhibits the same tendency. Rather than pinning down a specific explanation it is important to note that the role of institutional organized religion has been relatively marginal in these two societies until recently, and what role it did play was of low prestige compared to that in Western societies. In fact it can be argued that South Korea is simultaneously becoming a more religious and liberal society.

3\) Despite the fact that Sweden has high rates of nominal affiliation to the Lutheran church, ceremonial and ritual religion seems to be a more common feature of the lives of the Japanese.
