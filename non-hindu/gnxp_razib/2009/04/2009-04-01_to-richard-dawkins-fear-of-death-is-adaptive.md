To Richard Dawkins: Fear of Death is Adaptive

[Richard Dawkins: ‘There is something illogical about the fear of death’](http://www.cafebabel.com/eng/article/28887/interview-religion-atheism-richard-dawkins.html):

> ***The comfort of a dying soldier, the succour for a grieving mother or belief in the after-life of a widower – is it still possible to see the utility of certain psychological aspects in some religious beliefs or customs?*** \[Interviewer – R\]  
> I do see a psychological value, if it does have a real value. I would > not wish to be the person who destroys that person’s psychological > succour. I would not compromise with my public speaking out in the > public forum and writing. But if I was visiting someone who was > recently bereaved, I might dissemble somewhat in what I said, but > would not do so when writing a newspaper article. It is also > disputable whether it is that comforting, given that people are > brought up to fear hell for example. They might actually be comforted by the lack of religion, depending on their upbringing. **Although many of us fear death, I think there is something illogical about it.** \[Dawkins – R\]

My answer to Dr. Dawkins is in the title. To [paraphrase an old saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-Elr5K2Vuo), I learned it from [reading you](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192860925/geneexpressio-20)! Granted, it’s a short interview and I hope Dawkins is talking in the *proximate* sense of logic as opposed to *ultimate* evolutionary logic. But even then I’m having a hard time conceiving of why fear of death would be illogical, after all it often involves pain and there are plenty of “logical” reasons to fear pain.
