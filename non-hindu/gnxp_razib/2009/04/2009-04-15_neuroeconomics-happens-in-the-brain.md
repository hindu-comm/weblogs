Neuroeconomics happens in the brain

[Risk-dependent reward value signal in human prefrontal cortex](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/04/14/0809599106.short?rss=1):

> When making choices under uncertainty, people usually consider both > the expected value and risk of each option, and choose the one with > the higher utility. Expected value increases the expected utility of > an option for all individuals. Risk increases the utility of an option > for risk-seeking individuals, but decreases it for risk averse > individuals. In 2 separate experiments, one involving imperative > (no-choice), the other choice situations, we investigated how > predicted risk and expected value aggregate into a common reward > signal in the human brain. Blood oxygen level dependent responses in > lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex increased monotonically with > increasing reward value in the absence of risk in both experiments. > Risk enhanced these responses in risk-seeking participants, but > reduced them in risk-averse participants. The aggregate value and risk > responses in lateral prefrontal cortex contrasted with pure value > signals independent of risk in the striatum. These results demonstrate an aggregate risk and value signal in the prefrontal cortex that would be compatible with basic assumptions underlying the mean-variance approach to utility.
