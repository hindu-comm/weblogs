Adoptive parents invest more, get fewer returns

Via [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/), [Differential parental investment in families with both adopted and genetic children](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6H-4VT0H6P-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=88407f8793ac93b97c3d0d2f8c68fe77):

What’s going on?

  
In Western countries adoptive parents are screened. Many of them are of higher socioeconomic status, and they adopt children from the general population, with a likely skew toward lower socioeconomic status biological parents. The traits which determine your social status are a combination of environment and genes, the latter mediated through various personality dispositions and attributes. In fact there is plenty of data to show that shared parental environment **has a marginal long term effect.** This is not to say that there aren’t environmental inputs which matter, and which adoptive parents bring to the table, but their direct guiding is not the operative element. In [The Nurture Assumption](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857073/geneexpressio-20) Judith Rich Harris puts forward the hypothesis that the unaccounted for environment are peer groups.  
Does this mean that adoptive parents are in a futile race against genes? No. Genes express themselves in an environment, and that environment is to some extent within the power of a parent to control. That being said the biological parent confers upon the child more than simply superficial physical attributes, or deep aspects of physiology. Rather one’s character is partially heritable, and that character is a critical variable in long term life outcomes.  
As for the title, it’s perhaps crassly reductive, and no doubt simplifies the experience of being a parent. At least for many people.
