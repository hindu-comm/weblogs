Media meltdown hits science journalism

[Bora](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/) points to this [report about mega shakeups](http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2009/04/23/scientific-american-editor-out-in-reorg) at *Scientific American*. The editor for nearly a generation, John Rennie, is out. *Nature Publishing Group* is now calling the shots. In non-science news [Ezra Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein), king of all [journolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein#JournoList), is moving to [The Washington Post](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=04&year=2009&base_name=post_post). We live in the age of [creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) when it comes to media. I’m a [dabbler in](http://razib.com/) in writing about science, but as the years go by it seems that the media itself is converging upon my own bloggish means of production. I know that [Ross Douthat](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/) is going to produce print-worthy column prose for *The New York Times*, but I have to think there’ll be a qualitative stylistic difference from the days of William Safire influenced by Douthat’s “New Media” exposure.  
Speaking of converged New Media, there should be a bloggingheads.tv episode up Sunday or Monday which features myself & [Jake Young](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/).
