Group selection in The Huffington Post

I long ago noticed that [David Sloan Wilson](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sloan-wilson/) was a contributor to [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com). My own inclination at this point is still to believe that Wilson pushes too hard for group selection, and on occasion engages in the same sort of rhetorical excess which he accuses his critics, such as Richard Dawkins, of. That being said it is probably a net positive that a scientist manages to get some face time in the mainstream-web media. In any case, he has a series of posts on group selection up.
