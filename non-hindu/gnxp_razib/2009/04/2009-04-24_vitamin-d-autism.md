Vitamin D & autism?

[What If Vitamin D Deficiency Is a Cause of Autism?](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=vitamin-d-and-autism&print=true):

> As evidence of widespread vitamin D deficiency grows, some scientists are wondering whether the sunshine vitamin–once only considered important in bone health–may actually play a role in one of neurology’s most vexing conditions: autism.  
> The idea, although not yet tested or widely held, comes out of > preliminary studies in Sweden and Minnesota. Last summer, Swedish > researchers published a study in Developmental Medicine and Child > Neurology that found the prevalence of autism and related disorders > was three to four times higher among Somali immigrants than > non-Somalis in Stockholm. The study reviewed the records of 2,437 > children, born between 1988 and 1998 in Stockholm, in response to parents and teachers who had raised concerns about whether children with a Somali background were overrepresented in the total group of children with autism.  
> In Sweden, the 15,000-strong Somali community calls autism “the Swedish disease,” says Elisabeth Fernell, a researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and a co-author of the study.  
> In Minnesota, where there are an estimated 60,000 Somali immigrants, the situation was quite similar: There, health officials noted reports of autism among Somali refugees, who began arriving in 1993, comparable to those found in Sweden….

  
I started to get interested in Vitamin D a few years back for personal and intellectual reasons. I had deficiency myself despite the fact that I tried to make a proactive effort to get a lot of sun exposure (I take 2,000 IU caplets and I’m fine now). Over the past year and a half I can attest that my respiratory health has improved a great deal. In any case, I was also trying to figure out a reason that relatively light skin seems to have evolved recently simultaneously across Eurasia. The model I thought might be plausible was that a switch to agriculture resulted in less Vitamin D in the diet, and dense living increases the power of disease. As it happens the past few years have seen a [massive boom in medical research on Vitamin D](https://www.google.com/custom?q=vitamin+D&btnG=Search&hl=en&safe=off&client=pub-5976931228913298&cof=FORID:13;AH:left;S:http://scienceblogs.com;CX:ScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine;L:http://scienceblogs.com/channel/img/logo_science-blogs.gif;LH:66;LP:1;VLC:%23551a8b;GFNT:%23666666;DIV:%23cccccc;&cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&adkw=AELymgWD7YpzTOcVgNtSZHY5Mhy6hdHB7PgvGX5S_apHPgYh0-JOuCb4f9QnXSIy5raDCo5iclq1mw77hdktpz0o2YVeTjIyaAXanL1kgWtiY5CIP8qpvcQSa3IK_yhvc-3TBB9aNvTSGT0Q4ctm_7i-zrMreuoqD19rZWmxy4Gy0Nm4WktuFeilWZUg_skX_pPi33jo8oHB_nGDbBxz7HvkEGCKdAN8tA&boostcse=0&sa=2). I’ve talked to people about this and can’t help but express some skepticism as to whether there’s some faddishness to this, and whether Vitamin D is a corollary as opposed to a causal factor in terms of health. Additionally supplementation is a big business. In any case, a lot to chew on. Finally, I also wonder if the role of novel infection might be at work among the Somalis. Perhaps predisposition to autism occurs due to a pathogen which Somalis have not been exposed to until this generation because of relocation.
