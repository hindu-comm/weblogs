Smart people act more rationally in economics

[Cognitive skills affect economic preferences, strategic behavior, and job attachment](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/04/23/0812360106.short?rss=1):

> Economic analysis has so far said little about how an individual’s > cognitive skills (CS) are related to the individual’s economic > preferences in different choice domains, such as risk taking or > saving, and how preferences in different domains are related to each > other. Using a sample of 1,000 trainee truckers we report three > findings. First, there is a strong and significant relationship > between an individual’s CS and preferences. Individuals with better CS > are more patient, in both short- and long-run. Better CS are also > associated with a greater willingness to take calculated risks. > Second, CS predict social awareness and choices in a sequential > Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Subjects with better CS more accurately > forecast others’ behavior and differentiate their behavior as a second > mover more strongly depending on the first-mover’s choice. Third, CS, > and in particular, the ability to plan, strongly predict perseverance > on the job in a setting with a substantial financial penalty for early > exit. Consistent with CS being a common factor in all of these > preferences and behaviors, we find a strong pattern of correlation > among them. These results, taken together with the theoretical > explanation we offer for the relationships we find, suggest that > higher CS systematically affect preferences and choices in ways that > favor economic success.

From the discussion:

> The novel relationships we find have potentially deep implications. > For example, Gregory Clark recently suggested that the initial > location of the industrial revolution in England may have been due to > a “survival of the richest” selection process, that operated there > from as early as 1250 C.E…This selection may have been cultural, > genetic, or both. He suggests that selection favored “capitalist” > traits that include several of the ones (e.g. risk taking and saving > propensity) we analyze herein. Were these traits independent, it is > hard to imagine how a selection process could induce such a bundled > concentration in the time frame suggested. But if these traits are > correlated due to their linkage with cognitive skills, then a > “selection of the richest” explanation, operating through selection > for cognitive skills, becomes more plausible….
