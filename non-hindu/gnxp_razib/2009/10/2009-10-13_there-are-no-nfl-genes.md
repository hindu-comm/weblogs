There are no NFL genes (?)

[23andMe performs genome-wide association study on NFL players, fails to find athlete genes](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/10/23andme_performs_genome-wide_a.php):

(Yes, there are exceptions, but I don’t think a sensible prior expectation would be that athletic performance has a similar genetic architecture to macular degeneration.)

NFL players are taller and heavier than average, in addition to being able to [run the 40 in 4.5 seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash). Seems like a lot of these are [quantitative traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics).
