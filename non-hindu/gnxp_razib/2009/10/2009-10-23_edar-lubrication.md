EDAR & lubrication

[Enhanced Edar Signalling Has Pleiotropic Effects on Craniofacial and Cutaneous Glands](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007591):

> The skin carries a number of appendages, including hair follicles and > a range of glands, which develop under the influence of EDAR > signalling. A gain of function allele of EDAR is found at high > frequency in human populations of East Asia, with genetic evidence > suggesting recent positive selection at this locus. The derived EDAR > allele, estimated to have reached fixation more than 10,000 years ago, > causes thickening of hair fibres, but the full spectrum of phenotypic > changes induced by this allele is unknown. We have examined the > changes in glandular structure caused by elevation of Edar signalling > in a transgenic mouse model.

Similar changes to gland sizes and structures may occur > in human populations carrying the derived East Asian EDAR allele. **As > this allele attained high frequency in an environment that was notably cold and dry**, increased glandular secretions could represent a trait that was positively selected to achieve increased lubrication and reduced evaporation from exposed facial structures and upper airways.

Every explanation for the “classic Mongoloid” phenotype seems to go back to “cold and dry.” Some things never change.
