The new Technorati

The past few months Technorati really stopped working for me. Hardly any new links back in, at least that they detected. They unveiled a new site recently, you can [read about it at TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/14/the-new-technorati/). I really hate it, though to be honest I’d stopped using Technorati for a while. It looks like they pruned a lot of blogs, and that might be why I stopped seeing new links. In any case, here’s an unrepresentative and personal reason why I really think it’s a step back:  
The page for [Gene Expression](http://technorati.com/blogs/scienceblogs.com/gnxp) at ScienceBlogs (this domain).  
The page for [Gene Expression](http://technorati.com/blogs/gnxp.com) at gnxp.com, the original blog I started in the spring of 2002 and still contribute to. I’ve noticed for a while now that they were downgrading the relevance of this independent site, but they just decided to remove it from their index now.  
Looks like Technorati’s [long tail moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail) is over.  
If you care, the two sites receive comparable traffic, with gnxp.com usually a little ahead over the long term. About half of the total readership of both blogs reads both blogs.
