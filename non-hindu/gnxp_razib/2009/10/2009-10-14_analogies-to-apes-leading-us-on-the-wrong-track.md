Analogies to apes leading us on the wrong track

Reading the [papers](http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/) on *Ardipithecus ramidus* which just came out in *Science* one of the take-home points that jumps out at me is that **extant apes may be very misleading analogs to extinct hominins**. Here is [Owen Lovejoy](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/326/5949/74):

> In retrospect, clues to this vast divide between the evolutionary > trajectories of African apes and hominids have always been present. > Apes are largely inept at walking upright. They exhibit reproductive > behavior and anatomy profoundly unlike those of humans. African ape > males have retained (or evolved, see below) a massive SCC and exhibit > little or no direct investment in their offspring (their reproductive > strategies rely primarily on varying forms of male-to-male agonism). > Although they excel at some cognitive tasks, they perform at levels > qualitatively similar to those of some extraordinary birds…and > mammals…**The great apes are an isolated, uniquely specialized relict > species surviving today only by their occupation of forest > refugia**…Even their gut structure differs substantially from that of > humans….  
> Many key human specializations are related to our reproductive > physiology and anatomy; human reproduction is as extraordinary as our > dentition, locomotion, and encephalization…Although it remains > possible that such uniqueness emerged only during the Pleistocene, > this is less likely in light of Ardipithecus, which shows very early > evidence of a major social transformation…Moreover, **it is the modern > African apes that are most derived in many characters,** whereas those > which are specialized in human evolution (SCC elimination, bipedality) > are now known to have been present near the origin of our clade. Our > massive brains are obviously a Pleistocene development, but they are > also probably sequelae to other major shifts now more fully recorded > in the earlier fossil record. It is therefore possible, even likely, > that many physiologies and soft tissue features that do not fossilize > may have also evolved early in hominid evolution. If so, why were > these characters exaptive to our advanced cognition and singular > demographic success?

In other words, the common ancestor of chimpanzees & humans (which *Ardipithecus ramidus* may be in the line of) might have resembled humans in gross morphology, and perhaps social structure & behavior, more than chimpanzees. This is not totally counterintuitive, chimpanzees are relatively specialized [frugivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore). By contrast *Homo erectus* had already spread out across Eurasia and Africa, indicating a level of generality in adaptation and lifestyle. If Lovejoy and his fellow travelers are correct, books such as [Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395877431/geneexpressio-20) are far less plausible by the analogies they draw, and [Franz De Waal’s](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_0_10?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=franz+de+waal&x=0&y=0&sprefix=franz+de+w) body of work should be viewed with much more skepticism in terms of the generalizations that he, as a primatologist focusing on great apes, can make about the human condition. A similar problem has cropped up in using modern hunter-gatherer populations as analogs with ancient hunter-gatherer populations. Naturally the groups which managed to remain hunter-gatherers down to the present time are not likely to be a random and representative sample of pre-modern hunter-gatherers (e.g., they tend to inhabit extremely marginal territory). Compare the peoples of the Kalahari with social structures of the [Pacific Northwest tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Pacific_Northwest_Coast#European_colonization).
