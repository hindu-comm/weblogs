Biological Egalitarianism

Bruce Lahn and Lanny Ebenstein [write](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/461726a.html) ([pdf](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/Lahn.pdf)) in Nature: “Let’s celebrate human genetic diversity.” (Hat tip: [Steve Sailer](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/10/lahn-lets-celebrate-human-genetic.html).)

> The current moral position is a sort of ‘biological egalitarianism’. > This dominant position emerged in recent decades largely to correct > grave historical injustices, including genocide, that were committed > with the support of pseudo scientific understandings of group > diversity. The racial-hygiene theory promoted by German geneticists > Fritz Lenz, Imbler Fischer and others during the Nazi era is one > notorious example of such pseudoscience. Biological egalitarianism is > the view that no or almost no meaningful genetically based biological > differences exist among human groups, with the exception of a few superficial traits such as skin colour. Proponents of this view seem to hope that, by promoting biological sameness, discrimination against groups or individuals will become groundless. >

Agreed. I have [made this same argument](http://www.ephblog.com/2007/01/04/Genetic-Egalitarianism/) with regard to debates over higher education, although I prefer the terminology “genetic egalitarianism” since it better captures the fundamental assumption that genetics don’t matter.
