Remember the lizard men

[Carl Zimmer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/10/29/teach-the-lizard-overlord-controversy/) points me an [article](http://www.collegian.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=f6a4be5f-6858-4557-8ef0-c5b9e42af680) about a former anthropologist who has some weird ideas about the origin of man:

> Since his resignation from the university in 1990, however, Horn has > changed his tune. Once a staunch Darwinist and tenured CSU > anthropology professor, Horn has devoted the last 19 years of his life > to the study of alternative theories of human origin.  
> After receiving a doctorate in anthropology from Yale University and > while teaching at CSU, Horn focused his energies on the study of the > evolution of non-human primates, his wife Lynette Horn said.  
> He now advocates the theory that modern man is not the result of a > natural process of evolution, but that evolution was artificially > aided by reptilian extraterrestrials. The reptilians bred mankind as > servants and continue to rule the planet today, Horn said.  
> Reptilians have manipulated perceptions of world history and hold > power over humankind through their influence over an elite and > powerful group of humans, known as the Illuminati, Arthur said. > Throughout human history, the reptilian beings have been recorded as > dragons or gods.

Thought it was a joke, but it looks real.
