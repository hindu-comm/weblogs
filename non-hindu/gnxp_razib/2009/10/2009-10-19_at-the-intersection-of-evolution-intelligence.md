At the intersection of evolution & intelligence

If you’re at [ASHG](http://www.ashg.org/), a session you might want to attend, [Scale Effects and Recent Brain Evolution: Theory and Preliminary Evidence](http://www.ashg.org/cgi-bin/2009/ashg09s?author=jones&sort=ptimes&sbutton=Detail&absno=20006&sid=876392). Here’s the abstract:

> What forces have driven human evolution since the grand human > diaspora? In this paper, I argue that the scale effects so central to > endogenous growth theory in the field of economics (e.g., Kremer’s > widely-cited “Population Growth and Technological Change: 1,000,000 > B.C. to 1990,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1993) have been > important drivers of human brain development since the diaspora. Scale > effects have made prominent appearances in recent explanations of > continent-level outcomes. For instance, in Kremer’s model, big > continents create larger, denser, faster-growing populations. In > Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel model, wide continents raise the > chance that an innovation will arise at a given latitude, an > innovation which can then disperse across that latitude, enriching > those who live on wider continents. In both models, the Malthusian > nature of pre-Industrial Revolution existence imposes strong > conditions on the general equilibrium outcome. My model takes those > channels as given, and works out the theoretical implications for the > divergent evolution of human brains on these continents. Brains are > biologically costly, so evolution will only select for larger brains > if there is a substantial payoff. And since larger brains tend to have > higher levels of intelligence \[corr(Brain Size, IQ)= 0.4 in recent in > brain-scan studies\], larger brains tend to have more processing and > memory power. Under certain parameter values, Kremer’s and Diamond’s > models both imply that the payoff to a big brain–a brain that can > better adopt someone else’s ideas–will be higher on wider, larger > continents. Thus, we would expect human populations living on larger, > wider continents to develop larger, more powerful brains. I model this > relationship formally. This result should only hold on average: > intra-group diversity is central to evolutionary theory, and massive > intra-group diversity is an important fact of quantitative human > genetics. The main purpose of the paper is to set forth the model, but > I include some tests of its implications. I discuss whether, as the > model predicts, human brain size and average IQ correlate positively > with continent size and continent width. Indeed, evidence generally > supports this hypothesis. Further empirical testing of the model’s > predictions will occur as future researchers employ genetic diversity > databases. I plan to present the results in a manner intelligible to > non-economists.
