The vanilla city

I’ve gotten a few emails about this new article, [The White City](http://www.newgeography.com/content/001110-the-white-city), illustrated by this chart:  
![whitecity1.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/whitecity1.gif?resize=500%2C300)![whitecity1.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/whitecity1.gif?resize=500%2C300)  
This isn’t news. It’s only of interest because people like hoisting others up by their petards. When I lived in Portland I ran into several people who would complain about the city’s lack of diversity, but why had they moved from San Francisco in the first place? As for Minneapolis, the most famous black person I can think of from that city is [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)).  
But this isn’t just white racism. Progressive whites and black Democrats are part of a political coalition which has been fruitful, but that doesn’t mean they share social values. This is evident in the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08), where on many metrics blacks and conservative whites form a cluster.  
**Update:** OK, this might be a case where preconceptions influence what data analyses one might find plausible, so I’m going to look closer soon myself.
