Humans still evolving, etc.

[Are Humans Still Evolving? Absolutely, Says A New Analysis Of A Long-term Survey Of Human Health](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091019162933.htm):

Since large numbers of humans forgo reproduction in an evolutionary sense they might as well have died (excluding some inclusive fitness effects). If reproductive variance and heritable variation in traits correlated with that variance continues then naturally selection will be an operative phenomenon.

The paper is coming out in PNAS, so no guarantee when it’ll be online, Byars, S., D. Ewbank, et al. Natural selection in a contemporary human population. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(42) [DOI: 10.1073_pnas.0906199106.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073_pnas.0906199106)
