Did you pass a paper to me last december?

There are lots of weird search queries which come into this weblog. Or any website, period. But this month 3 times someone arrived via this query: ‚Äúlast december i passed a paper along to razib.‚Äù

1\) If you‚Äôre the person who arrived in this way, could you tell me what‚Äôs up? Was I supposed to blog on something? Did I not give you credit? I‚Äôm genuinely perplexed.

2\) Especially over the past year the number of publicists contacting bloggers has increased. **A lot.** So my regular correspondence is getting drowned out, and I‚Äôm probably not as good about responding to people, crediting them appropriately, etc. (though often readers of this weblog know what I‚Äôd be interested in, and I get nearly simultaneous emails from several different people, so crediting is an issue). Some of these publicists are rather chatty and send emails which look to be personally targeted. Just so you know.

**Note:** People might be curious, but two of the top 10 searches relating to me coming into this weblog over the past 3 years (how long I‚Äôve had Google Analytics installed) involve [Matt Yglesias](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/) and [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/) üôÇ
