Maybe it was agriculture

[A genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 22 loci associated with eight hematological parameters in the HaemGen consortium](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.467.html):

We consider here the genetic variation in eight > clinically relevant hematological parameters, including hemoglobin > levels, red and white blood cell counts and platelet counts and > volume. We describe common variants within 22 genetic loci > reproducibly associated with these hematological parameters in 13,943 > samples from six European population-based studies, including 6 > associated with red blood cell parameters, 15 associated with platelet > parameters and 1 associated with total white blood cell count.

In [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091011184422.htm):

But, through a systematic analysis of correlated traits we can begin to discover such shared genetic variants, forming the basis for understanding how these processes interact to influence health and disease.

This sort of disease-based pleiotropy is of course interesting because disease really bites. On the other hand, I think other many interesting phenotypes are out there which probably emerged due to pleiotropy. [East Asian hair](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=edar&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com) and [European eye color](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/02/blue-eyes-correlate-with-lighter-skin.php) are two guesses. Looking for these clusters of traits associated with one genotype might be a nice way to crank-down the probability of an adaptive-story.
