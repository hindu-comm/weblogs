Inferring demographic history

Very interesting paper in PLoS Genetics, [Inferring the Joint Demographic History of Multiple Populations from Multidimensional SNP Frequency Data](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695). Hereâ€™s the author summary:

> The demographic history of our species is reflected in patterns of > genetic variation within and among populations. We developed an > efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic > variation, given a demographic model including such events as > population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. > We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, > searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our > joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations > yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, > we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 > years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because > our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be > important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. > We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to > model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for > recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.

And from the abstract:

> We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 > thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is > earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate > migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) > divergence time to be 23 kya (95% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long after > archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95% c.i.: 16.3-26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration.

I would keep in mind these 95% confidence intervals, but I immediately wondered about this [European-East Asian divergence time just like Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/10/140000-year-divergence-time-between.html).
