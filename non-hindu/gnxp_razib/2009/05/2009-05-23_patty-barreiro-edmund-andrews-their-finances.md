Patty Barreiro & Edmund Andrews & their finances

[Megan McArdle](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/05/edmund_andrews_has_responded_t.php) posts Edmund Andrews’ response to her revelation of his wife’s bankruptcies. Megan concludes:

> On a very broad note, I don’t see this as a story about the goodness > or badness of Andrews or Barreiro–and I’ve been dismayed by some of > the nastiness about her in comments here and elsewhere. Rather, I > think this matters because the story Andrews told was basically about > the subprime crisis, and the book casts him as a sort of everyman, > lured in by cheap credit and a likeable scoundrel of a mortgage > broker. That may be what happened to many, or most people in the > mortgage crisis–but the back to back bankruptcies strongly suggest that this is not what happened to Andrews. That said, I think the story told with the bankruptcies included would still be a story well worth telling.

As Megan notes, **even** if Patty’s bankruptcies weren’t relevant, he should have brought them up to show they weren’t relevant.
