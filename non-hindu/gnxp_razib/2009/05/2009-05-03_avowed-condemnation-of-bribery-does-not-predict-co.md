Avowed condemnation of bribery does not predict corruption

[Below](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/is-sweden-more-stereotypically-nordic.php) when I compared the Nordic countries and Italy on a host of variables, I noted in the comments that it was rather amusing that 99% of the people in Bangladesh asserted that bribery was never justifiable, while only 69% of Swedes did. More specifically, the [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) simply asked if bribery was ever justifiable, and there 10 options, with 0 = never justifiable and 10 = always justifiable. So 99% of the Bangladeshis chose 0, while only 69% of Swedes did. Plotting the [2008 Corruptions Perceptions Index](http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table) scores from Transparency International against the proportion who chose 0, bribery is never justifiable, resulted in this:

**Here’s the raw data**:
