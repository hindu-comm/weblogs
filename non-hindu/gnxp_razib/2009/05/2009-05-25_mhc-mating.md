MHC & mating

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/05/mhc-dissimilar-mating-in-brazil.html) points me to new research on [MHC and mating](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-05/esoh-oa052109.php):

> The scientists studied MHC data from 90 married couples, and compared > them with 152 randomly-generated control couples. They counted the > number of MHC dissimilarities among those who were real couples, and > compared them with those in the randomly-generated ‘virtual couples’. > “If MHC genes did not influence mate selection”, says Professor > Bicalho, “we would have expected to see similar results from both sets > of couples.

These are intriguing results. But there is also some data for selective positive assortative mating; e.g., females being attracted to the smell of those who have their father’s MHC alleles! So though the balance of research for humans does seem to suggest some aspect of “opposites attracting,” it isn’t quite a slam dunk.  
Also, contrary to what the authors state assortative mating is still alive and kicking. The study uses a Brazilian sample, which is likely as close as one can get to [panmixia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panmixia) in a racial mixed society, but in the United States well over 95% of whites still marry other whites. That being said, I do know that outmarriage rates are highest among American Indians, who have relatively homogeneous MHC profiles. Unfortunately their relatively small numbers, and already high white admixture, serve as barriers toward drawing too much from this data.
