Kids today are fatter than they feel

Via [Marginal Revolution](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/), [Has Overweight Become the New Normal? Evidence of a Generational Shift in Body Weight Norms](http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2009/wp0903.htm):

> We test for differences across the two most recent NHANES survey > periods (1988-1994 and 1999-2004) in self-perception of weight status. > **We find that the probability of self-classifying as overweight is > significantly lower on average in the more recent survey, for both men > and women, controlling for objective weight status and other > factors.** Among women, the decline in the tendency to self-classify > as overweight is concentrated in the 17-35 age range, and, within this > range, is more pronounced among women with normal BMI than among those > with overweight BMI. Among men, the shift away from feeling overweight > is roughly equal across age groups, except that the oldest group > (56-74) exhibits no difference between surveys. In addition, > overweight men exhibit a sharper decline in feeling overweight than > normal-weight men. Despite the declines in feeling overweight between > surveys, weight misperception did not increase significantly for men > and decreased by a sizable margin among women. The shifts in > self-classification are not explained by differences between surveys > in body fatness or waist circumference, nor by shifting demographics. > We interpret the findings as evidence of a generational shift in > social norms related to body weight, and propose various mechanisms to > explain such a shift, including: **(1) higher average adult BMI and > adult obesity rates in the later survey cohort, (2) higher childhood > obesity rates in the later survey cohort, and (3) public education > campaigns promoting healthy body image.** The welfare implications of > the observed trends in self-classification are mixed.

I think you already knew this. Also see [Markâ€™s post](http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/obesity_-_a_new_study_and_what.php) on the health implications of [obesity](http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/05/obesity_-_a_new_study_and_what.php).
