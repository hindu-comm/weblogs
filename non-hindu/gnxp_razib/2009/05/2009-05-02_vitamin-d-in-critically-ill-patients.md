Vitamin D in critically ill patients

[Low Vitamin D Causes Problems For Acutely Ill Patients](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090430091052.htm):

> Dr Paul Lee, Professor John Eisman and Associate Professor Jackie Center, researchers at Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research, examined a cohort of 42 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Forty-five percent turned out to be Vitamin D deficient.  
> …  
> When the team correlated the Vitamin D levels with a disease severity > score, there was a direct correspondence between sickness and Vitamin > D deficiency. In other words, the sicker someone was, the lower the levels of Vitamin D. Out of the 42 patients studied, there were 3 deaths. **The 3 patients who died all had the lowest level of Vitamin D in the cohort.**

The big glaring issue here is causality. Is the level of Vitamin D just an indicator of someone who is ill, or a reason they are prone to being ill? More research needs to be done:

> The next step will be a randomised control study to investigate > whether Vitamin D has benefits in critically ill patients. In simple terms, two groups of patients (who are evenly matched) will be treated, with Vitamin D added to the treatment of one group, but not the other. The outcomes will then be compared.  
> So should doctors be trying to raise the Vitamin D levels of their patients in the meantime?  
> Dr Lee hopes the randomised study may provide a more definitive answer > to the question. “However, Vitamin D is very safe. **It’s inexpensive > and has a very large safety window, making toxicity unlikely, unless > there are underlying diseases causing high calcium.** Giving vitamin D > to severely deficient patients is very unlikely to cause harm. In addition, ICU patients are lying in bed for a long time, and are at risk of bone loss and osteoporosis. So if nothing else, Vitamin D will help protect their bones.”

Supplementation may not be a cure all, and we may find that all these correlations are popping out of the fact that Vitamin D levels are a proxy for suppressed immune systems in some manner. But the downsides of supplements are probably minimal. Here’s the [letter in *The New England Journal of Medicine*](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/360/18/1912).
