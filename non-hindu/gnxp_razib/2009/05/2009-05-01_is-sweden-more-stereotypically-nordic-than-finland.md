Is Sweden more stereotypically Nordic than Finland?

Over the years several Finnish readers (OK, one specific Finnish reader) has made the repeated claim that some of the stereotypes that Americans have of politically correct (Fenno)-Scandinavians is actually typical of Sweden, and not Finland, or even the other Nordic countries. As I’ve been poking around [The World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) I think there is something to this. There are some sets of questions where the Swedes give much more “Politically Correct” answers than Finns, or even other Nordics. I note that the answers are Politically Correct because I’m not necessarily saying that the answers someone gives on a survey necessarily translates into the same magnitude of public policy difference. The World Values Survey happens to have Denmark, Sweden and Finland (at least the *Four-wave Aggregate of the Values Studies* which I’m using). I decided to post responses to a large range of questions (obviously a finite set) for these three nations, as well as Italy as European outgroup. Many of the responses were as you would expect; the Nordic countries are more openly secular than Italy. The fact that Italians were more hostile to the idea of living next to large families also was not surprising, at least judging from what I’ve heard of how they view the French as breeders. On the other hand, there are a host of questions where Sweden is the outgroup, and another set where Sweden and Denmark are relatively close, with Finland approaching Italy in social outlooks. Finally, many of the results reinforce an interesting point that was clear when I looked at Hong Kong: **socialist nations often exhibit some fatigue at the extent of the nanny state, while nations with thinner social safety nets have a more positive attitude toward future extension of the welfare state**. Since the results below are a finite subset I invite readers to go in and explore [The World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) themselves.

**Note:** Sample sizes are around 1,000 for each nation. Additionally the surveys were done in 1999 to 2001.
