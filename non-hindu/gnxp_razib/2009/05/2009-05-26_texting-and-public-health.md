Texting and public health

The journal of record, [Texting May Be Taking a Toll](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26teen.html?src=sch). WTF? I recall there were articles years ago about addiction to email, the web. Now also social networking sites. Is this just a general phenomenon that whenever new technologies appear that teens are enthusiastic about the media will play up fears of how it might be dangerous or deleterious? Do people remember stuff about how widespread usage of telephones were going to cause problems too?
