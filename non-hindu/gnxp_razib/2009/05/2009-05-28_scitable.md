Scitable

I already pointed to [Scitable](http://www.nature.com/scitable) on my [other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/05/scitable_nature_as_king_of_all.php), and I thought I would here too. It’s a new education oriented site put out by *Nature* which is currently focused on genetics. The topics section [is pretty good](http://www.nature.com/scitable/topics) for a more-deep-than-Wikipedia but not-quite-a-research-paper level stuff. They do have a “feedback” option, but I really think they might benefit from having a comment feature which can be hidden. There’s a lot that can be learned about a subject from the various debates people have about specific terms (this sort of feeback occurs in Wikipedia discussions).
