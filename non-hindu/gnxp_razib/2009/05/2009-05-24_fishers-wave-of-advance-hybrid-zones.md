Fisher's Wave of Advance & Hybrid Zones

[Waves of stationary shape](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/waves-of-stationary-shape.php):

> Over at Scienceblogs, people are talking about waves. Of course, > everyone thinks that waves are in the domain of physics, and people > always forget about one of my favorite subjects: waves of advance. Way > back in the day, RA Fisher wondered what might happen if genes had to > spread not just locally but across space, and he published his > findings in a landmark article called The Wave of Advance of > Advantageous Genes. This paper was not just important for its > contributions to population genetics, but because of fundamental > contributions to applied mathematics. As far as I can tell, Fisher and > the great mathematician Kolmogorov published similar findings on this > same subject in the same year. To that end, these kinds of waves of > advance are often referred to as “Fisherian” waves.  
> What was Fisher’s model, what did he find, and how has it been > extended?
