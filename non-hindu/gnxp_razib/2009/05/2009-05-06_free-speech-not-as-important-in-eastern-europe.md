Free speech not as important in Eastern Europe

With the whole controversy around [Michael Savage](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1177558/JAMES-SLACK-Banned-list-wont-protect-extremists--just-smokescreen-distracting-Labours-slow-death.html) being blocked from entering England because of his inflammatory comments I thought I would look at attitudes toward speech. One thing I’ve noticed is that Americans tend to be less instrumental when it comes to matters of speech; that is, speech is not justified as a means, as opposed to being a basic liberal right. In contrast in most other parts of the world people seem more likely to justify the right to speech as a utility in the service of some other end. This difference results in a variance in the way people approach offensive and patently societally unredeemable speech.  
The [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) has a question about national goals where individuals rate the goals as :  
Very important  
Important  
Not very important  
Not at all important  
Below the fold are the proportions of those who rated free speech as a not very important, or not at all important, national goal.
