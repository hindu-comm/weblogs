5-HTTLPR & neuroeconomics

[A Genetically Mediated Bias in Decision Making Driven by Failure of Amygdala Control](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/18/5985?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&author1=Roiser&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&fdate=1/1/2008&resourcetype=HWCIT):

Check out the Wikipedia entry on [5-HTTLPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HTTLPR); lots of behavioral phenotypes associated with this variant. [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090505174541.htm):

> The researchers also measured the degree of interaction, or > connectivity, between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, the > brain region most implicated in human intelligence, personality and > decision making. **When resisting the frame effect, the participants with two copies of the long variant had stronger connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, while those with a pair of short variants did not.** >
> “This difference in connectivity is really interesting,” says Dr > Roiser. “It suggests that the volunteers carrying the long variant might regulate automatic emotional responses, which are driven by the amygdala, more efficiently, lessening their vulnerability to the framing effect. >
> “This one gene cannot tell the whole story, however, **as it only > explains about ten per cent of the variability in susceptibility to the framing effect.** What determines the other ninety per cent of variability is unclear. It is probably a mixture of people’s life experience and other genetic influences. >

So you might hypothesise that traders with the long genetic variant would make more consistent decisions, though this needs to be tested in future research.”

So this genetic variation only explains 10% of the variation within the population when it comes to frame effect in behavioral economics. Fair enough. But, I do wonder if in the current political environment fewer would oppose genetically black-balling individuals with the short variants of 5-HTTLPR from becoming traders! (I’m not proposing this seriously myself, but I think there might be some amygdala-driven acceptance of this sort of genetic profiling right now even if the returns are small)
