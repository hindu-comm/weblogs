Culture evolving & converging due to genes

In *Nature*, [De novo establishment of wild-type song culture in the zebra finch](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature07994.html):

> Culture is typically viewed as consisting of traits inherited > epigenetically, through social learning. However, cultural diversity > has species-typical constraints, presumably of genetic origin… Zebra > finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce > song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in > laboratory11 or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from > isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring > generations in two social environments: tutor-pupil pairs in > sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both > settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain > characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. **Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations.** Thus, species-typical song culture can appear *de novo*….

Here’s [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090503132617.htm) with an outline:

> Scientists have known for decades that the “innate” song of an > isolated songbird is different from the “learned” song of a songbird > that was tutored by an adult. But where did that adult tutor’s song come from? Obviously from it’s own father, but where did this passed-down song originate? “This is a classic chicken-and-egg problem,” says Mitra.

A hypothesis, and experiment. Perfect.  
But of course this has possible implications outside of birds, as there are many organisms with culture morphs which emerge through a complex interaction between gene disposition and various environmental parameters. Consider human beings. A *tabula rasa* view of human nature which was common until recently in much of [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict) seemed to posit that our species could explore a nearly infinite sample space of possibilities when it comes to the range of characteristics of societies. [Evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) in the classical sense arose in the 1980s as a counterpoint to this sort of thinking, emphasizing [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Universals) and invariant behavioral and social traits which presumably have a biological basis and are genetically encoded.  
Both of these extreme positions clearly do not accurately describe the dynamic reality of human cultural evolution and development. Rather than a “flat” and nearly infinite space of possibilities, or a topology of a only a few narrow stable peaks, it seems possible that human culture flows through a space with peaks, valleys, constraints and canals. To me this theoretical “middle ground” is much more in keeping with the empirical reality of the [cyclical nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_dynasties) of many societies, as well as insights from game theory as to how complex group dynamics evolve over time.
