The incentives for finding "genes for"….

[Genes, Brains and the Perils of Publication](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/05/genes-brains-and-perils-of-publication.html):

> I have no wish to criticize these findings as such. But the way in > which this paper is written is striking. **The negative results are > passed over as quickly as possible.** This despite the fact that they are very clear and easy to interpret – the rs1344706 variant has no effect on cognitive task performance or neural activation. It is not a cognition gene, at least not in healthy volunteers. >
> By contrast, the genetic association with connectivity is modest (see the graphs above – there is a lot of overlap), and very difficult to interpret, since it is clearly not associated with any kind of actual differences in behaviour. >
> **And yet this positive result got the experiment published in no less > a journal than *Science*!** The negative results alone would have > struggled to get accepted anywhere, and would probably have ended up > either unpublished, or published in some rubbish minor journal and > never read. It’s no wonder the authors decided to write their paper in the way they did. They were just doing the smart thing. And they are perfectly respectable scientists – Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, the senior author, has done some excellent work in this and other fields.
