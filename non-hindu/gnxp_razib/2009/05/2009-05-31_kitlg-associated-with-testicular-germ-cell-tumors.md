KITLG associated with testicular germ cell tumors

[Two](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.393.html) [papers](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.394.html) in Nature Genetics report today that variation in KITLG is associated with development of testicular germ cell tumors. Regular readers of this site will [recognize that gene name](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=kitlg&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com): KITLG is also one of the important loci contributing to [differences in skin pigmentation](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2007/12/kitlg_makes_you_white_skinned.php) between human populations. The authors are aware of this:

This makes for quite a nice story–selection for lighter pigmentation in Europeans appears to have led to the increase in frequency of a linked variant that causes increased risk of TGCT. As we understand more about the genetics of human traits, I suspect that examples like this–where traits are correlated due to selection on one impacting the other simply due to physical proximity–will become rather common.
