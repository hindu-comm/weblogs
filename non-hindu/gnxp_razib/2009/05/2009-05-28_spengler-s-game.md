Spengler's game

[Austin Bramwell](http://www.takimag.com/article/who_is_spengler/) has a [piece up](http://www.takimag.com/article/who_is_spengler/) where he focuses on [Spengler](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/others/spengler.html)‘s (David Goldman, not the original Oswald Spengler) intellectual hero [Franz Rosenzweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Rosenzweig). Bramwell suggests:

> I consider only the political implications of *Star*, of which, > surprisingly enough, I find very few. The Spenglerian theses in > particular seem more like a creative gloss or “misprision” of > Rosenzweig than an accurate restatement of his views. **For all > Spengler’s obeisance to Rosenzweig, I suspect that Goldman came up > with his stuff on his own.**

*Star* is Rosenzweig’s book [The Star of Redemption](https://books.google.com/books?id=pXxTAo8BKH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=star+of+redemption&ei=lGofSqzgK4v8lQTOlIHiCA). The link is to Google Books, so you can read a fair amount before you hit the preview limit.

GNXP reader [TGGP](http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/calling-out-spengler/) pointed out an obvious Spenglerian dishonesty a long time ago. Just as Bramwell suggests that Spengler’s oeuvre has far less to do with Rosenzweig than he might represent, TGGP found an instance where he cited as a support for an argument a footnote which didn’t support his argument **if you actually read the original source,** which most of his readers obviously would not.

All of this matters because I occassionally get emails from big fans of Spengler who want me to give a response to this column or that, and sometimes he is brought up as an authority in the comments. He’s also cited by people who I believe to be sincere seekers of truth such as [Rod Dreher](http://www.beliefnet.com/Search/Site.aspx?q=Spengler). But frankly the kind of thing TGGP put the spotlight on isn’t surprising, when people point me to an “awesome” Spengler column there’s a lot of smoke and mirrors, and the intellectual equivalent of “card tricks” pop up over and over. This doesn’t mean the conclusions he reaches are necessarily incorrect, and if a plate of shady facts is your cup of tea if that’s what you need get to dessert, I say go to town. I generally pass when that’s on the menu. Look at this [catch](https://isteve.blogspot.com/2006/10/spengler.html) by Steve from several years ago. Spengler’s assertion is pretty much a joke on the face of it factually (read [The Reformation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670032964/geneexpressio-20/) by Diarmaid MacCulloch for why you should be laughing), but 99% of his readers wouldn’t know that, so they will continue to follow his close reasoning from false premises. His columns are mind-numbing because they’re riddled with this sort of misinformation.
