Is the world getting more religious?

I was in the bookstore and decided to look through [God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594202133/geneexpressio-20). The authors work at *The Economist*, so I assumed it was going to be more reportage than a popular distillation of scholarship. I haven’t read the whole thing, but that seems about right, skimming through I kept picking up errors or tendentious assertions. The very title is, in my opinion, only tenuously rooted in any factual secular trend. [Secularization theory’s](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_3_60/ai_57533379/) overreach has given rise to a huge counter-literature which argues for the progressively more fervent religiosity of the world. But much of this has little to do with scholarship. Just as [George Lakoff](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/10/pinker_vs_lakoff.php) knows his audience, and so tailors his “scientific” message in the interests of getting his ideas out there through book sales, so the popular press knows very well that articles and books about the resurgence of religion will sell well. After all, there are *many* religious people out there. A few years ago David Aikman published [Jesus in Beijing: How Christianity is Transforming China and Changing the Global Balance of Power](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//1596980257/geneexpressio-20). The book had a natural base when it came to potential sales. No matter that he tended to push [highbound estimates](http://www.assistnews.net/STORIES/2007/s07100011.htm) for the number of Christians in China, the business is demand side driven.

We don’t need to talk about China. There’s a nation where the mainstream media has been hyping religious revival for the past generation that hasn’t been happening: the United States. As far back as the 2000 Religious Identification Survey it was clear that the 1990s were a period of major decline in denominational affiliation. Those data [have been confirmed over the past decade](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/paradox-of-unaffiliated.php). The religious revival in the United States was simply in the minds of hopeful evangelicals, and terrified secular liberals who wanted to hype the power of the religious Right so as to elicit a counterresponse from the Left. And of course cover stories on the rise of evangelical America sell copy (again, scared secularists and enthusiastic evangelicals).

So what’s the data around the world? Let’s look at the [World Vaues Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/). There are five “waves” to the WVS, and of these the last four have had a question of the form: For each of the following aspects, indicate how important it is in your life. **Religion**. The answers are:

1 Very important  
2 Important  
3 Not at all important

Below the fold I’ve the data from waves 2, 3, 4 and 5 for all the nations. Some obviously don’t have data for a particular wave. Wave 2 is from around 1990 (some are as early 1989, with a few as late as 1993). Wave 3 is from around 1995-1998. Wave 4 around 2000. And wave 5 is from 2005-2008. The numbers represent the proportion who agreed that religion was “very important.”

[TABLE]

Yes, there are almost certainly issues about representativeness across these samples over the years. And the data are spotty. But in any case, there a few cases where we have other sources which confirm the trend line. Spain has become notably more secular over the past 20 years. China has seen an increase in religion over the past 20 years. But I don’t see a very strong trend in either direction on a worldwide basis, and I assume a lot of the jumping around individually probably has to do with the nature of the sample . The point is that **there hasn’t been a massive secular trend in increased religiosity.** But who cares? John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge will sell a lot of copies of their book predicated on a likely moronic axiom (judging by the elementary errors that I quickly spotted they don’t know much about the topic besides what they read in newspapers).

Here’s a line graph where I placed all the nations with at least 3 data points. See if you can discern anything from the noise….

I invite readers to weight the data by the populations of these nations and see if, for example, the likely enormous relative increase in religiosity in China from hardly anyone being religious to a small minority being religious is making a worldwide difference. Doing a scatter of wave 2 on wave 5 for those nations which had those two gave an incredible slope of 1.01!
