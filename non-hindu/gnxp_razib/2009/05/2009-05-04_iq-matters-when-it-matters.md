IQ matters when it matters

As many have [noted](http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/05/sonia-sotomayors-iq.php), *The New Republic* is now [publishing perceptions](http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=45d56e6f-f497-4b19-9c63-04e10199a085) that [Sonia Sotomayor](http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=45d56e6f-f497-4b19-9c63-04e10199a085) is not that intelligent. Granted, even if affirmative action played a role in her acceptance to Princeton and Yale law school, the fact that she graduated and passed the bar suggests a minimum threshold of ability. But that’s not good enough, it seems that many liberals would like someone who can go toe-to-toe with the conservatives on the court intellectually, and she doesn’t pass the grade on that elevated level. When the stakes are high, and a Supreme Court position is arguably one of the most powerful positions within the American government, the perceived marginal returns on more *g* become stark for those who would pooh-pooh it in other contexts.

Addendum: As noted in the comments, yes, it doesn’t take a genius to know how political confederates want you to rule. I happen to think that most moral & political reasoning is really moral & political rationalization. So the key is simply to find people who can argue in a crisp manner in favor of positions they already hold a priori. More generally I accept there is some systematic tendencies in terms of what the smart, as opposed to the dumb, believe, regardless of their ideology. See [The Myth of the Rational Voter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691138737/geneexpressio-20) for examples. But let’s not confuse the signal for the noise.
