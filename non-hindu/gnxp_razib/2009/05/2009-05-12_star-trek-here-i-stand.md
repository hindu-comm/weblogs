Star Trek, Here I Stand

I went and watched the new *Star Trek* movie this weekend. It was alright. Worth the money. But there’s one thing that’s been getting in my craw about criticisms about the film, so I thought I would air my dissent. Since it’s a spoiler, below the fold….

  
I liked the fact that the time travelers broke temporal continuity and that we’re now veering off into an alternative timeline. Time travel was cute when Harlan Ellison came up with it in the 1960s, but it’s done, overused and stale. In fact I began to feel years ago that it was a get-out-of-jail card whenever writers didn’t have any new ideas. It was lame. Some Trek-nerds are complaining that it shatters the whole canon. Who cares? To quote St. Ambrose, there is no shame in passing to better things. If the price of that is the expiration of the old canon, so be it.
