Patty Barreiro's personal credit history?

Most people have probably read Edmund Andrews’ piece in *The New York Times*, [My Personal Credit Crisis](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/magazine/17foreclosure-t.html?_r=1&ref=business&pagewanted=print) (expanded into the book [Busted: Life Inside the Great Mortgage Meltdown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393067947/geneexpressio-20/)). Many raised eyebrows when reading this:

> **We had very different ideas about money.** Patty spent little on > herself, but she refused to scrimp on top-quality produce, Starbucks > coffee, bottled juices, fresh cheeses and clothing for the children > and for me. She regularly bought me new shirts and ties to replace the > frayed and drab ones in my closet. **She thought it wasn’t worth > agonizing over nickels and dimes.** I was almost exactly the opposite. > My answer to any money squeeze was to stop spending. I would skip lunch at work to save \$7. If I arrived at the Metro just before the end of rush hour, I would wait for five minutes to save 50 cents on the fare.

Fresh juices? I like [Odwalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odwalla) but I usuall think the better of it. In any case [Megan McArdle](http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/05/the_road_to_bankruptcy.php) has found that there’s a lot more in this direction:

> But en route to that moral, it turns out the story has been tidied up > a little. **Patty Barreiro, Andrews’ wife, has declared bankruptcy twice. The second time was while they were married, a detail that didn’t make it into either the book or the excerpt that ran in last Sunday’s *New York Times Magazine.***  
> Andrews’ desire to shield his wife is understandable–hell, laudable. > No decent person wants to parade their spouse’s financial trouble in > front of the world. But this is material information that changes the tenor of his story. **Serial bankruptcy is not a creation of the current credit crisis**, and it doesn’t just happen to anyone, particularly anyone with a six figure salary.

Many people were already skeptical of Andrews’ sob story because it was to a large part one of his own making. He seems to want to shuck responsibility because he had enablers. But this piece of information changes things a great deal. As Megan notes the very few individuals have serial **personal** (as opposed to business) bankruptcies on their record, and, those who have upper middle incomes to boot are even rarer.
