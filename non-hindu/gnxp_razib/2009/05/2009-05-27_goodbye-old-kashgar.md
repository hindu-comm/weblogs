Goodbye Old Kashgar

[To Protect an Ancient City, China Moves to Raze It](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/world/asia/28kashgar.html?pagewanted=print). The city is [Kashgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashgar), in the far west of China. I have read that Kashgar is the large city furthest from oceans on all directions. It’s a typical story of developers wanting to develop. You read articles like this about Beijing all the time (or did, I assume that most of the developing to be done has been done). One issue that I’m curious about though, my understanding is that China (and East Asia in general) has fewer buildings of great antiquity than in the West because so much of the monumental architecture was in wood. This results in ancient cities being viewed as relatively ephemeral, with the elements (especially fire) taking what humans don’t eventually tear down and reprocess. So there is [very little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian#Architecture) of the earlier dynasties in the old imperial capital of Xi’an because the complexes of the imperial family and aristocrats were made of wood. Perhaps some of the reporting of how heartless Chinese bureaucrats are in regards to historic buildings suffers from a cultural gap whereby societies which materials like stone assume more permanence to architecture than those which rely in less durable medium such as wood.
