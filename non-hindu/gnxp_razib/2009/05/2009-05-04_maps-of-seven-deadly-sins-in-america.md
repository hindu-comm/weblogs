Maps of Seven Deadly Sins in America

Via [Andrew Sullivan](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/mapping-sin.html), [One nation, seven sins: Geographers measure propensity for evil in states, counties](http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/mar/26/one-nation-seven-sins/). Here’s the methodology:

> Greed was calculated by comparing average incomes with the total > number of inhabitants living beneath the poverty line. On this map, > done in yellow, Clark County is bile (see map on Page 2).  
> Envy was calculated using the total number of thefts — robbery, > burglary, larceny and stolen cars. Rendered in green, of course, Clark > County is emerald.  
> Wrath was calculated by comparing the total number of violent crimes — > murder, assault and rape — reported to the FBI per capita. Vought and > his colleagues used the color red to illustrate wrath, so Clark County > looks like a fresh welt. Washoe is slightly statistically duller. > Everywhere else is a friendly pork pink.  
> Lust was calculated by compiling the number of sexually transmitted > diseases — HIV, AIDS, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea — reported per > capita. Here again, Clark and Washoe counties are worst. Carson City > County is a close third.  
> Gluttony was calculated by counting the number of fast food > restaurants per capita, and this is one category where Clark County is > bested. First in deep fry goes to Carson City.  
> Sloth was calculated by comparing expenditures on arts, entertainment > and recreation with the rate of employment. Here again Clark County is > beat, scoring only average on the scale of sloth.  
> And pride, lastly, is most important. The root of all sins, in this > study, is the aggregate of all data. Vought and his Kansas colleagues > combined all data from the six other sins and averaged it into an > overview of all evil. So pride, mapped in purple, shows the states two > darkest bruises: counties Clark and Carson City.

Below are screenshots of the maps in standard deviation units; red naturally is more sinful, blue less sinful.
