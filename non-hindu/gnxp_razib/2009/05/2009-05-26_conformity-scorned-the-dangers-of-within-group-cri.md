Conformity scorned, the dangers of within group criticism….

In light of my post on politics and personal perspective yesterday, I thought this [“exchange”](http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2009/05/mark-levin-on-dreher-frum-and-friedersdorf.html) between [Mark Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levin) and [Conor Friedersdorf](http://theamericanscene.com/2009/05/25/debating-dan-riehl-bottom-of-the-first-inning) would be of note. Also see [Rod Dreher](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/05/the-minor-tragedy-of-mark-levi.html) on the controversy. In any case, here you have a case where the principals agree on the broad political issues at stake, and many of the specifics as well, **but disagreemants over style lead Levin to [*takfir*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takfir) his critics.** In fact, if you read the comments at the first link it’s clear that Friedersdorf’s point is basically unintelligible to many fans of Levin.
