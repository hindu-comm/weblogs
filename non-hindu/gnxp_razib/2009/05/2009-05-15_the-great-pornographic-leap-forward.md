The great pornographic leap forward

[Full-Figured Statuette, 35,000 Years Old, Provides New Clues to How Art Evolved](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/science/14venus.html?_r=1&src=sch).

> Some women in hunter-gathering societies do have abnormally large > buttocks, a condition called steatopygia. It’s especially common among > the Khoisan in southern Africa and tribes in the Andaman Islands. It > is sometimes considered a sign of beauty, and may have inspired some of the more voluptuous ancient figurines. The most famous example of steatopygia was the Hottentot Venus, a Khoikhoi woman whose physical characteristics made her a sideshow sensation in 19th-century Europe.

Look, this is just an excuse to write an article about ancient obesity and bring up steatopygia. The Egyptians likely never knew anyone who looked like [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus).
