Your neuro-personality in graphics

[The Neurocritic](https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/05/im-people-person.html) points me to a paper, [The brain structural disposition to social interaction](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122394540/abstract):

> Social reward dependence (RD) in humans is a stable pattern of > attitudes and behaviour hypothesized to represent a favourable > disposition towards social relationships and attachment as a > personality dimension. It has been theorized that this long-term > disposition to openness is linked to the capacity to process primary > reward. Using brain structure measures from magnetic resonance > imaging, and a measure of RD from Cloninger’s temperament and > character inventory, a self-reported questionnaire, in 41 male > subjects sampled from a general population birth cohort, we > investigated the neuro-anatomical basis of social RD. We found that > higher social RD in men was significantly associated with increased > gray matter density in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia and > temporal lobes, regions that have been previously shown to be involved > in processing of primary rewards. These findings provide evidence for > a brain structural disposition to social interaction, and that > sensitivity to social reward shares a common neural basis with systems > for processing primary reward information.

Mean gray matter density was extracted from each of the clusters that we identified using linear regression, transformed into Z-scores, and plotted versus RD. The lines represent the best fit for the associations when adjusted for total gray matter volume.*
