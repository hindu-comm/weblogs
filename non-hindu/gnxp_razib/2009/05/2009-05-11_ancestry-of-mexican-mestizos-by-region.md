Ancestry of Mexican Mestizos by region

[Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/11/0903045106.abstract). The title says it all, so I wonâ€™t post the abstract. The article is OA, so you can read the whole thing, but I thought this figure from the supplements was pretty informative:

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/mestizo-736337.png)Sonora is exactly where you would expect Mestizos to be the most European, while Guerrero on the coast has more African ancestry. See the paper for other Mexican provinces. The use of a Northwest European population is of course somewhat imperfect as the white ancestry of Mestizos is Iberian (though European populations really are not very differentiated in the worldwide context). Additionally, the Zapotecs would be imperfect representative of the genetic variation of all the Amerindians of Mexico (some of whom are likely to emigrated from the American Southwest relatively recently).
