Gregory Clark is an idiot

[Greg Clark](http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/), chair of the UC Davis Econ department, [admits he’s an idiot](http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/02/wheres_my_money_idiot.php):

> I myself was so confident of the consensus of the end of the business cycle that I persuaded my wife after the collapse of Lehman Brothers to invest all her retirement savings in the stock market, confident that the Fed would soon make things right and we could profit from the panic of a gullible public. **The line “Where is my money, idiot?” is her’s.**
