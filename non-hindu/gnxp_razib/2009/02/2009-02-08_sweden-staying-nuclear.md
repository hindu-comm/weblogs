Sweden staying nuclear?

[FuturePundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/005942.html) points out that Sweden [might not phase out nuclear power](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,605957,00.html#ref=rss):

> The decision has angered the Swedish opposition as well as > environmentalists around the world. “To rely on nuclear power to > reduce CO2 emissions,” Greenpeace spokeswoman Martina Kruger said, “is > like smoking to lose weight. It’s not a good idea.”
