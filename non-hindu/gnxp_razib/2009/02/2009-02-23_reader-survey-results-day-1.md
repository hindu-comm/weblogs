Reader Survey Results, day 1

Since I asked regular readers to [fill out a survey](http://humanvariationfaq.org/limesurvey/index.php?sid=93544&newtest=Y), I’ve received over 300 responses. My own experience with these surveys is that about 50% of the total responses come within 24 hours. Next weekend I’ll put up the .csv file with all the data, and present some of my analyses as well. But below the fold I’ve placed the raw frequency data if you are curious; there isn’t likely to be any major changes in proportions with the next 300 respondents, and there weren’t any great surprises. Here’s a foretaste of weirdness in the survey data that I’ll present next week. 66 respondents claimed they were Muslim or Christian. Of these, here are their attitudes toward the existence of God:  
No Answer – 1.52%  
Does Not Exist – 12.12%  
Skeptical of Existence – 16.7%  
Doubtful of Existence – 1.52%  
Believe Existence Possible – 24.24%  
Beliee Existence Probable – 18.18%  
Know God Exists – 19.70%  
No Opinion – 6.06%  
For comparison, here is two GSS results for all Christians & Muslims on God:  
Does Not Exist – 1.2%  
Know God Exists – 70%  
(For the record, of the 5 Muslims in the GNXP readership, only 1 knew God existed, and 3 were atheists or agnostics on the God question!)
