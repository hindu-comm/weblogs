The function that f**ked the world?

[Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all):

> In hindsight, ignoring those warnings looks foolhardy. But at the > time, it was easy. Banks dismissed them, partly because the **managers empowered to apply the brakes didn’t understand the arguments between various arms of the quant universe**. Besides, they were making too much money to stop.  
> …  
> They didn’t know, or didn’t ask. One reason was that the outputs came > from “black box” computer models and were hard to subject to a > commonsense smell test. Another was that the quants, who should have > been more aware of the copula’s weaknesses, weren’t the ones making > the big asset-allocation decisions. Their managers, who made the > actual calls, **lacked the math skills to understand what the models were doing or how they worked.** They could, however, understand something as simple as a single correlation number. That was the problem.

Pr\[T_(A) \< 1, T_(B) \< 1\] = Φ₂(Φ⁻¹(F_(A)(1)),Φ⁻¹(F_(B)(1),γ)), the [Gaussian copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(statistics)#Gaussian_copula). I’m waiting for the book to come out titled “The World Is Not [Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).” Here’s a PDF of the [paper referenced in the article](http://www.defaultrisk.com/_pdf6j4/On%20Default%20Correlation-%20A%20Copula%20Function%20Approach.pdf), a quick skim doesn’t suggest that it’s really that opaque a piece of financial mathematics. The problem seems to be the same as with [Value at Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk) which was profiled in [The New York Times Magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html?pagewanted=print). [Long Term Capital Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) was claiming regular occurrences of “10 [sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) events” when it was going through its meltdown in 1998. Risk has a tail as long and vicious as a [Diplodocus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diplodocus_size_comparison.png).
