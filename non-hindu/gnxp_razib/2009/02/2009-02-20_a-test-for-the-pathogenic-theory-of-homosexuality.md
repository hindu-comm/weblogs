A test for the pathogenic theory of homosexuality?

Compare monochorionic to dichorionic twins. If there’s a teratogen causing homosexuality then it should show up as a statistical difference in concordance for homosexuality.

Of course this would only tell us whether there is a prenatal pathogen. It wouldn’t rule out the possibility that there is a pathogen that only strikes later on.
