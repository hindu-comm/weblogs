Steelers win!

I stopped watching professional football, or even kept track of it before the playoffs, after 2003. Since then “my team,” the Steelers, have won 2 Super Bowls. I stopped watching professional basketball at around the same time, and of course last spring “my team,” the Celtics, won a championship.
