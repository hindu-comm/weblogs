The Deep Web

[Exploring a ‘Deep Web’ That Google Can’t Grasp](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/technology/internet/23search.html?src=SkimBU&pagewanted=print). I remember when I first encountered Google, right after reading this [article](http://archive.salon.com/21st/rose/1998/12/21straight.html) in *Salon*. Not to put a fine point on it, I was tired of search engines that returned a list of porn stars when I was trying to look up the black conservative “Shelby Steele.” Obviously Google changed that, the search experience become so quantitatively different than it was qualitatively different. There was the pre-Google web, and the post-Google web. In any case, I’ve been hearing stuff about the “Deep/Dark Web” for years now. Hopefully someone will figure this out. There was a time when you’d play around with a few search engines as well as a directory like Yahoo to find some information. Google was such an improvement that it introduced one-stop searching, making [MetaCrawler](http://www.metacrawler.com/) irrelevant. If some of these Deep Web technologies pan out, perhaps we can do away with Orbitz too.
