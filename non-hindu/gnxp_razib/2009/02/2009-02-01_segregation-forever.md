Segregation forever?

[My Sister’s Keeper](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/fashion/01womyn.html?sq=lesbian&st=cse&scp=1&pagewanted=print):

Finding one another in the fever of the gay rights and women’s liberation movements, they built a matriarchal community, where no men were allowed, where even a male infant brought by visitors was cause for debate.

The minute a man walks in the dynamics change immediately, so I choose not to be around those dynamics.”

There are some general insights here. After all, **people are more comfortable around “their own kind,”** however you define it. I find the broadly liberal presupposition that individual autonomy is the axiom from which moral action should start less and less persuasive as a description of how the modal human operates in the world. The communities and worldviews surveyed in the article above did give me some flashbacks to feminist science fiction written during the 1970s and 1980s, e.g., [The Shore Of Women](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OYK24Q/geneexpressio-20). I recall that [Ecotopia](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553348477/geneexpressio-20/), written in the 1970s, had a segregated “Soul City.” The author, Ernest Callenbach, admitted that during that period black nationalism was ascendant and there was general skepticism of the viability of an integrated society.  
Today this sort of racial and sexual segregation may seem simply an echo of radicalisms past, but we live in the age of the Great Sort. In a nation where 90% of Americans are religious 90% of the people I know are irreligious. Many conservatives have few liberal friends and many liberals have few conservative friends. The abortion issue is so polarized that sincere people on both sides view their antagonists as moral ogres. People may trumpet the benefits of diversity and argue for the importance of treating everyone as an individual, but there are classes of diversity which many explicitly condemn (e.g., white nationalism, religious radicalism), and stereotypes which are implicitly assumed (e.g., liberals are godless and amoral, conservatives are selfish and hypocritical).
