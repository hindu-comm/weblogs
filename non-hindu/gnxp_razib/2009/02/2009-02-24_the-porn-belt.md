The Porn Belt

[Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/) points me to an interesting paper, [Red Light States: Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment?](http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf). Here’s an interesting map which shows states with high and low porn subscription rates (dark = high, light = low).

Here’s a table with the data, controlled for some variables.

This part is amusing:

> The fourth column reports that in regions where more people report > regularly attending religious services (per National Election Studies > 2004), overall subscription rates are not statistically significantly > different from subscriptions elsewhere…However, in such regions, a > statistically significantly smaller proportion of subscriptions begin > on Sundays, compared with other regions. In particular, a 1 percent > increase in the proportion of people who report regularly attending > religious services is associated with a 0.10 percent reduction in the > proportion of purchases that occur on Sunday. This analysis suggests > that, on the whole, those who attend religious services shift their > consumption of adult entertainment to other days of the week, despite > on average consuming the same amount of adult entertainment as others.

Remember Pete Du Pont’s op-ed, [Gore Carries the Porn Belt](http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=65000578)?
