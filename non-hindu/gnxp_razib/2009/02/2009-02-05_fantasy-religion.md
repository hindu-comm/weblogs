Fantasy = religion?

I recently finished [The Hero of Ages](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765316897/geneexpressio-20), which concludes the [Mistborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misting) trilogy. The author, Brandon Sanderson, has been selected to finish Robert Jordan’s [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time). Sanderson is a Mormon, so I was curious if anyone else thought that the resolution to the series [resembled a very distinctive aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis#Latter-day_Saint_views) of Mormon beliefs? (it didn’t bother me personally, mythic literature and religious cosmology seem to be moving around the same cognitive furniture)
