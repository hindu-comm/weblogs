The rise of the black wolf

[Molecular and Evolutionary History of Melanism in North American Gray Wolves](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1165448):

> Morphologic diversity within closely related species is an essential > aspect of evolution and adaptation. Mutations in the Melanocortin 1 > receptor (Mc1r) gene contribute to pigmentary diversity in natural > populations of fish, birds, and many mammals. However, melanism in the > gray wolf, Canis lupus, is caused by a different melanocortin pathway > component, the K locus, that encodes a beta-defensin protein which > acts as an alternative ligand for the Mc1r. We show that the > melanistic K locus mutation in North American wolves derives from past > hybridization with domestic dogs, has risen to high frequency in > forested habitats, **and exhibits a molecular signature of positive > selection.** The same mutation also causes melanism in the coyote, Canis latrans, and Italian gray wolves, **and hence our results demonstrate how traits selected in domesticated species can influence the morphologic diversity of their wild relatives.**
