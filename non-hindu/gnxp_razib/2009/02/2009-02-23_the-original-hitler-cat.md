The original Hitler cat

![socksii.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/socksii.gif?resize=254%2C372)![socksii.gif](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/socksii.gif?resize=254%2C372)[Obit Magazine](http://www.obit-mag.com/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5205) has a fascinating rumination on the life & times of Socks Currie-Clinton:

> One of the most telling political photographs of the past few decades > is a snapshot of a cat. Against an unassuming suburban backdrop, the > picture shows a black-and-white feline crouched on a sidewalk while an > equipment-laden quintet of photographers close in. The paparazzi, it > turned out, had lured the cat outside so they could get the shot all > America wanted to see. It was November of 1992, and that animalâ€™s > owner, Bill Clinton, had just been elected president of the United > States.
