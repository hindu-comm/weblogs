Illustrative, not supportive

I hear & read the term “anecdotal evidence” a great deal. But wouldn’t it be better to say “anecdotal illustration”? After all, most of the time a few anecdotes do nothing to increase confidence in a hypothesis, rather, they illustrate possible instances assuming that the hypothesis is true.
