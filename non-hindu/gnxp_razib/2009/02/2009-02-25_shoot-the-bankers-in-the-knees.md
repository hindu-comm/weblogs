Shoot the bankers in the knees?

[How bank bonuses let us all down](https://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa89be08-02aa-11de-b58b-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1):

One of the issues that comes up in predictions about political prospects is that the party in power tends to be buffeted by the business cycle, and receives both the credit and the blame, even though they may only control the dynamic to a modest extent. In this way many of the large financial firms resembled governments; they blew up on the bubble, and now with the collapse it’s rather clear that they didn’t add all the value that they claimed. But as readers have pointed out **on an individual level those who received windfalls through a winner-take-all-system have no incentive to avoid risks.** I think the chance of non-trivial clawbacks is close to zero (I’ll be happy to be proven wrong!).  
The contrast with entrepreneurs is telling. The .com bubble & burst was tragic, but it did produce notable technologies, the seed of later gains in economic productivity. The asset and finance bubble seem unlikely to generate the same positive externalities in the wake of correction of irrational exuberance. But all that being said, even though we are moving past an age of massive economic parasitism due to [principle-agent problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem) the potential engines of productivity through innovation remain. There are still entrepreneurs, and with the shrinking of the financial industry the pool of those who engage in the ***real* game of risk and reward** is increasing in size.
