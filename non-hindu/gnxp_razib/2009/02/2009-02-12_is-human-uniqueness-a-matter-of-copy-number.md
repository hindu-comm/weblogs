Is human uniqueness a matter of copy number?

[A burst of segmental duplications in the genome of the African great ape ancestor](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/abs/nature07744.html):

> It is generally accepted that the extent of phenotypic change between > human and great apes is dissonant with the rate of molecular > change…Between these two groups, proteins are virtually > identical…cytogenetically there are few rearrangements that > distinguish ape-human chromosomes3, and rates of single-base-pair > change…and retrotransposon activity…have slowed particularly within > hominid lineages when compared to rodents or monkeys. Studies of gene > family evolution indicate that gene loss and gain are enriched within > the primate lineage…Here, we perform a systematic analysis of > duplication content of four primate genomes (macaque, orang-utan, > chimpanzee and human) in an effort to understand the pattern and rates > of genomic duplication during hominid evolution.

We discover striking examples of recurrent > and independent gene-containing duplications within the gorilla and > chimpanzee that are absent in the human lineage. **Our results suggest > that the evolutionary properties of copy-number mutation differ > significantly from other forms of genetic mutation and, in contrast to the hominid slowdown of single-base-pair mutations, there has been a genomic burst of duplication activity at this period during human evolution.**

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090211161840.htm) has some breathless coverage. But are we, *H. sapiens*, so special in our evolutionary history?\* The title above about human uniqueness seems to be the major framing assumption when this sort of research gets spun….  
\* Well, Mike Lynch [very specific ideas](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934847/geneexpressio-20) about how we are special.
