Credit snobs remembered….

[Ziel](https://lyingeyes.blogspot.com/) points me to an amusing post, [The Credit Snobs](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/03/expensive_credi.html):

> I rather like the title “voodoo priest of free market economics” so I am happy to take the blame for the sub-prime mortgage defaults and at the same time stick a few pins in Nouriel Roubini.  
> Roubini and others generating hysteria about defaults in the mortgage > market are credit snobs – they think credit is something that only the > rich can handle. Just look at the language that Roubini uses to > analogize borrowers – they are “reckless patients” who “spent the last few years on a diet of booze, drugs and artery clogging junk food.” Similarly, the Washington Post tells us that it’s the end of the “borrowing binge.”

Check out this comment from “DK”:

> The critical question for me is how much pain the subprime loans > really cause their borrowers. Yes, some people will end up homeless > and with their savings wiped out, and their suffering will be severe. > But many people will end up in rental housing (i.e. where they would > have been all along if subprime lending was not available), and not > all will lose their houses. And many people with ARMS and low initial > rates are significantly better off than they would be if they had chosen traditional fixed-rate loans, especially young families who intended from the beginning to move when their 5 year locked rate expired.
