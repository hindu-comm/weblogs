Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex

If you have problems getting Ubuntu Hardy Heron to work properly, I strongly recommend you check out Intrepid Ibex, the newest release. I’m having way fewer issues with it on my Toshiba Satellite notebook (if you are fine on Hardy Heron perhaps “upgrading” will mess you up). The UI also seems slicker. Not nearly as smooth as OS X, or even Vista, but a definite improvement. The [Wubi](http://wubi-installer.org/) Windows Installer makes it really easy to take it for a test drive without compromising your access to your standard OS, you don’t have to go “all-in.”
