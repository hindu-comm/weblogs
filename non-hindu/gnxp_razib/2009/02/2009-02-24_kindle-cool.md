Kindle Cool

[The Kindle: Good Before, Better Now](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/personaltech/24pogue.html?pagewanted=print). A woman was using a Kindle at Starbucks the other day. She really didnâ€™t get much reading done, people kept wanting to talk to her about her Kindle, and look at it themselves. The Kindle will have made it when people can actually use it in a public place without being harassed.
