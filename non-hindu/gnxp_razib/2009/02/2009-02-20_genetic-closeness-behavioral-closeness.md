Genetic closeness != behavioral closeness

Sheril’s post, [Chimpanzees Are NOT Pets!](http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/02/chimpanzees_are_not_pets.php), is good. She notes:

Chimps live to be 50 years old and grow almost as big as a human male. They have extremely powerful muscles and are 5-10 stronger than a heavy weight boxer.

There is some more nuance to this.  
1) Dog breeds differ in temperament, so not all are equally fluent in the ways of man  
2) Dogs can [read human faces](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/5598/1634):

These findings suggest that during the process of domestication, dogs have been selected for a set of social-cognitive abilities that enable them to communicate with humans in unique ways.

The domestic dog has been selected to be our best friend. Cats are perhaps a different matter, but due to their relative aloofness and small size “misunderstandings” are less problematic than they would be with a Great Dane. In any case, *H. sapiens* is a relatively gracile ape, our closest relatives the chimpanzees can tear us apart, quite literally. Travis, the chimp who maimed a woman and was killed [clearly had a history of acting out](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090220/ap_on_re_us/chimpanzee_attack). His owner also seemed to have an [inappropriate emotional relationship](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090220/ap_on_re_us/chimpanzee_attack) to him.
