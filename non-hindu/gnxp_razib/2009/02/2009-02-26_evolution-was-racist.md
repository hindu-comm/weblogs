Evolution was racist

I just got pointed to [Confronting Evolution’s Racists Roots](http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/547627.aspx) via my RSS. This is a common tactic. And it might work for unsophisticated people on the margins. Just like a tract like “Christianity’s racist past” would also sell. Or, “Socialism’s white supremacist heritage.” But intellectually it’s a rather low-brow tactic. The real question is: **Is It True?** The racism of European intellectuals and the racialist inferences made from evolutionary theory are of historical interest, but not of scientific ones. It isn’t as if a tract with the title “Jesus Christ, Semitic Supremacist,” would disabuse most Christians of the truth of their faith.  
This really doesn’t matter except in a meta sense. Many Intelligent Design proponents want to recast their movement as something separate & distinct from the crass lowbrow methods of Young Earth Creationism. John West, who is flogging Darwin’s racism in the article (and has done so elsewhere) is a fellow at the [Discovery Institute](http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&isFellow=true&id=18). Of course it doesn’t surprise me that they’re going this route, but it confirms.
