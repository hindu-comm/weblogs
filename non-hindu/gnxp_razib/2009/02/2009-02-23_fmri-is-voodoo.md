fMRI is voodoo?

*Seed Magazine* has a [nice review](http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2009/02/that_voodoo_that_scientists_do.php) of the brewing controversy over shoddy statistical methods in the field of fMRI. To some extent science is politics, this is a sexy and appealing field. A friend of mine who is a psychologist mentioned that though he doesn’t think much of fMRI the head of his lab group wanted to make sure that there was always some neural imaging in their papers to increase the likelihood of acceptance. A few vivid images is worth a lot of turgid prose; even if some of the criticisms of fMRI are overblown I suspect that it was necessary that the field be brought down a few pegs. Here’s [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/01/more-on-the-so-.html) weighing in:

> Conversely, I suspect one of the frustrations of Lieberman et al. is > that they are doing a lot more than correlations and fishing > expeditions–they’re running experiments to test theories in > psychology, they’re trying to synthesize results from many different labs. And from that perspective it must be frustrating for them to see a criticism (featured in the popular press) that is so focused on correlation, which is really the least of their concerns.

In other words, fMRI is good as a part of a well-rounded scientific portfolio, but not as a silver-bullet.
