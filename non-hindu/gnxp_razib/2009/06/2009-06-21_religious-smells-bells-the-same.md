Religious smells & bells the same?

Due to the nature of following current international events I’ve been checking out YouTube more than I usually do, and one thing led to another and I ended up on a video of prayer services at a Zoroastrian temple in [Yazd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazd). Watching the prayers (go to 1:30) I was struck by how Muslim they seemed to me. I have read that Muslim prayer 5 times a day was in part an attempt to one up the Zoroastrians, who pray 3 times a day. In any case, I decided to see what a Coptic prayer was like, Coptic being the ritual language of the Christians of Egypt. I don’t know if the Coptic prayer was in Coptic or Arabic, I honestly can’t tell them apart (I know that Coptic is not a Semitic language), but I was struck by how Muslim it sounded to me as well. I was reminded of when a Korean friend explained how the Buddhist channel and the Catholic channel in Korea were sometimes hard to distinguish because they featured people in robes (presumably priests) praying a lot (my friend was raised a Roman Catholic). Anyway, YouTube clips below.
