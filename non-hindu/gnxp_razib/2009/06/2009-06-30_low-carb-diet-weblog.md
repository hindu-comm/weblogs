Low carb diet weblog

A friend of mine has a new weblog, [Low Carb Art and Science](https://lowcarbartandscience.blogspot.com/), which some of you might be interested in (or not). I do think it is ironic since this is an individual who presumably is in favor of a diet of [red beans & rice](http://www.lyrics007.com/Sir%20Mix-A-Lot%20Lyrics/I%20Like%20Big%20Butts%20Lyrics.html). If you want a more eclectic range of posts on diet you might want to check out [FuturPundit](http://futurepundit.com/).
