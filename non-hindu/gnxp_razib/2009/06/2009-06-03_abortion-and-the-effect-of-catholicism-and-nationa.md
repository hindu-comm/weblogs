Abortion and the effect of Catholicism and nationality

A few years ago the [Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2006/08/godless-countries-favor-abortion-my.html) found that Protestant & Orthodox countries favored abortion to a greater degree than Roman Catholic ones. He did add though that many of the nations in the former category were nominally in the category (e.g., Sweden) I have always been curious about if Catholicism has any effect on attitudes toward abortion *within* nations. It is known in the USA that there isn’t much of a difference between Catholics and non-Catholics on this topic, rather, it is conservative Protestants stand out. [The World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) has a question which asks if abortion is ever justifiable. I thought it would be interesting to break these data down between Catholics and non-Catholics in various countries.

I look at nations which had large Catholic and non-Catholic populations. Not just non-religious (like France), but with religious identified non-Catholics. For example, the Netherlands has large historical Catholic and Protestant populations. I used WVS waves 3 & 4 and aggregated them together. I looked at WVS 5 separately. So some nations are entered twice. Where there were no Protestants, such as in Bosnia, I used Orthodox Christians. In a few Latin American nations Protestants were distinct from Evangelicals. The former usually includes members of historic immigrant communities with culturally Protestant traditions. Their numbers were small in any case, so I simply substituted Evangelical, which usually refers to relatively recent converts to Pentecostalism.

As you can see, most of the variation is **between** nations, not within them. In many cases Protestants are more pro-life than Catholics. In nations such as Chile most Protestants are relatively conservative evangelicals, disproportionately from the lower socioeconomic strata. In the Netherlands I suspect it has to do with the [conservative Protestant Bible Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)), while most liberal Dutch Reformed have simply become “Nones.”
