Empathy & neurobiology

Related to yesterday’s post,[The neural bases of empathic accuracy](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/22/0902666106.short?rss=1):

> Theories of empathy suggest that an accurate understanding of > another’s emotions should depend on affective, motor, and/or higher > cognitive brain regions, but until recently no experimental method has > been available to directly test these possibilities. Here, we present > a functional imaging paradigm that allowed us to address this issue. > We found that empathically accurate, as compared with inaccurate, > judgments depended on (i) structures within the human mirror neuron > system thought to be involved in shared sensorimotor representations, > and (ii) regions implicated in mental state attribution, the superior > temporal sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex. These data demostrate > that activity in these 2 sets of brain regions tracks with the > accuracy of attributions made about another’s internal emotional state. Taken together, these results provide both an experimental approach and theoretical insights for studying empathy and its dysfunction.
