Mirror neurons not all that?

[Asymmetric fMRI adaptation reveals no evidence for mirror neurons in humans](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/02/0902262106.abstract):

Many great claims have been made for mirror neurons. V.S. Ramachandran said on *Edge* [MIRROR NEURONS and imitation learning as the driving force behind “the great leap forward” in human evolution](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/ramachandran/ramachandran_p1.html).
