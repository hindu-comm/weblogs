Earwax and breast cancer

In light of p-ter’s post on [KITLG and cancer risk](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/kitlg-associated-with-testicular-germ.php), I stumbled onto this today, [Earwax, osmidrosis, and breast cancer: why does one SNP (538G\>A) in the human ABC transporter ABCC11 gene determine earwax type?](http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/6/2001):

> One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 538G\>A (Gly180Arg), in the > ABCC11 gene determines the type of earwax. The G/G and G/A genotypes > correspond to the wet type of earwax, whereas A/A corresponds to the > dry type. Wide ethnic differences exist in the frequencies of those > alleles, reflecting global migratory waves of the ancestors of > humankind. We herein provide the evidence that this genetic > polymorphism has an effect on the N-linked glycosylation of ABCC11, > intracellular sorting, and proteasomal degradation of the variant > protein. Immunohistochemical studies with cerumen gland-containing > tissue specimens revealed that the ABCC11 WT protein was localized in > intracellular granules and large vacuoles, as well as at the luminal > membrane of secretory cells in the cerumen gland, whereas granular or > vacuolar localization was not detected for the SNP (Arg180) variant. > This SNP variant lacking N-linked glycosylation is recognized as a > misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and readily undergoes > ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which determines the dry > type of earwax as a mendelian trait with a recessive phenotype. **For > rapid genetic diagnosis of axillary osmidrosis and potential risk of > breast cancer,** we developed specific primers for the SmartAmp method > that enabled us to clinically genotype the ABCC11 gene within 30 min

I [blogged a paper](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/01/wet_or_dry_ear_wax.php) on this SNP relating it to earwax form a few years ago. Also see [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090601102025.htm). The variation in earwax seems to conform pretty closely to that of [EDAR](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=edar&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com).
