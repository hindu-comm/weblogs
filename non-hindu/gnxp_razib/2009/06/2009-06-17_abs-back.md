Abs & back

[Is Your Ab Workout Hurting Your Back?](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/core-myths/):

> Instead, he suggests, a core exercise program should emphasize all of > the major muscles that girdle the spine, including but not > concentrating on the abs. Side plank (lie on your side and raise your > upper body) and the “bird dog” (in which, from all fours, you raise an > alternate arm and leg) exercise the important muscles embedded along > the back and sides of the core. As for the abdominals, no sit-ups, > McGill said; they place devastating loads on the disks. An approved > crunch begins with you lying down, one knee bent, and hands positioned > beneath your lower back for support. “Do not hollow your stomach or > press your back against the floor,” McGill says. Gently lift your head > and shoulders, hold briefly and relax back down. These three > exercises, done regularly, McGill said, can provide well-rounded, thorough core stability. And they avoid the pitfalls of the all-abs core routine. “I see too many people,” McGill told me with a sigh, “who have six-pack abs and a ruined back.”

I know some readers are fitness buffs. Thoughts?
