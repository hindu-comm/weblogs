40 year old virgins!!!

[FuturePundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/006282.html) points to a [New Scientist piece](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/06/who-is-the-40-year-old-virgin.html) on a new [study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122421649/abstract) profiling older virgins. [Who is the 40-Year-Old Virgin and Where Did He/She Come From? Data from the National Survey of Family Growth](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122421649/abstract):

> A total of 122 (13.9%) men aged 25-45 reported never having had sex, > representing approximately 1.1 million American men in this age > cohort. Among female participants, a total of 104 (8.9%) women aged > 25-45 reported never having sex, representing approximately 800,000 > American women in this age cohort. Both men and women who reported > that they attend religious services one or more times per week were > more likely to be sexually abstinent, independent of their specific > religious beliefs. Virgin status was also significantly associated > with drinking alcohol within the past year. While a college degree in women predicted virginity, education was not associated with virginity in men. Men showed lower rates of sexual abstinence if they reported having spent time in prison or serving in the military.

*New Scientist* reports some very interesting details though:

> Men and women who attended church at least once a week were > respectively 5 and 3.9 times more likely to be virgins than those who > attended church less often. Virgins of both sexes were slightly less likely to have swigged a beer in the last year, compared to non-virgins. And women with college degrees were 5.4 times more likely to be virgins than women who never got their Bachelor’s.  
> …  
> The study also found that male homosexuals were 11 times more likely > to be virgins than heterosexuals, while female homosexuals were 6 times more likely to say they were virgins than heterosexuals. African American men and women were significantly less likely to be virgins than any other ethnic group.  
> Just as notable as the characteristics associated with middle-aged virginity are the traits that aren’t. Weight, income, and health all showed no association with virginity in men or women.
