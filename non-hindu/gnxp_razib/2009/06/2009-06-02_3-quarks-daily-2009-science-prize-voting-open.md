3 QUARKS DAILY 2009 SCIENCE PRIZE: voting open

[Nominees](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/the-nominees-for-the-3qd-prize-in-science-are.html) are now up for [3 Quarks Daily Science Prize](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/). I have four posts up:  
Genetic variation in space & time – Iceland  
How Ashkenazi Jewish are you?  
Inbreeding & the downfall of the Spanish Hapsburgs  
The ancient origins of African pygmies  
There are many great posts on the list obviously, but I want to point also to my friend Dan MacArthur’s submission, [Is a personal genome sequence worth \$350,000?](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2008/09/your_own_private_genome.php).  
After reading these posts you can [vote](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/3-quarks-daily-2009-science-prize-vote-here.html) up until June 8th.
