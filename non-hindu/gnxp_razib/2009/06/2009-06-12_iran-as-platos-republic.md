Iran as Plato's Republic

[Joshua Trevino](http://joshuatrevino.com/) points out that Khomeini’s original conception of how the Iranian state was governed was to be governed was derived from [Plato’s Republic](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920508-3,00.html). This is not that surprising, the Shia clerical elite of Iran has been engaged in [various innovations from the 18th century on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuli).
