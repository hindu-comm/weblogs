Selection for tameness

[Genetic Architecture of Tameness in a Rat Model of Animal Domestication](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/182/2/541):

> A common feature of domestic animals is tameness-i.e., they tolerate > and are unafraid of human presence and handling. To gain insight into > the genetic basis of tameness and aggression, we studied an intercross > between two lines of rats (Rattus norvegicus) selected over \>60 > generations for increased tameness and increased aggression against > humans, respectively. We measured 45 traits, including tameness and > aggression, anxiety-related traits, organ weights, and levels of serum > components in \>700 rats from an intercross population. Using 201 > genetic markers, we identified two significant quantitative trait loci > (QTL) for tameness. **These loci overlap with QTL for adrenal gland > weight and for anxiety-related traits** and are part of a five-locus > epistatic network influencing tameness. An additional QTL influences > the occurrence of white coat spots, but shows no significant effect on > tameness. The loci described here are important starting points for > finding the genes that cause tameness in these rats and potentially in > domestic animals in general.
