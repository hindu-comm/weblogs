Polygyny as a function of nation and religion

[TGGP has a post up](http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/muslim-attitudes-toward-polygyny-by-country/) where he looks at attitudes toward polygyny in predominantly Muslim nations. The question is:

> To what extent do you agree or disagree with men having more than one > wife? Do you strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree?

I decided to break-down by religion in those nations which had a large non-Muslim population. Results below.

**Update:** Above I only posted those Muslim nations with large enough religious minorities for there to be comparisons. Here are the frequencies who “strongly agree” + “agree” with men having more than one wife for all the nations:

Algeria – 43  
Bangladesh – 5.5  
Indonesia – 18.7  
Iran – 11.5  
Iraq – 47.1  
Jordan – 18.7  
Morocco – 37.5  
Nigeria – 39.4  
Pakistan – 1.1  
Saudi Arabia – 42.1  
Turkey – 15.6  
Egypt – 10.3
