Pleiotropy and disease

Two interesting papers, one which [relates *KITLG* and cancer](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/kitlg-associated-with-testicular-germ.php), and another which connects [ABCC11 and cancer](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/06/ear-wax-to-breast-cancer-risk.php). These are familiar genes. [KITLG](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=kitlg+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) has been implicated in depigmentation, both of skin and hair. [ABCC11](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=abcc11+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) in earwax form and body odor. If you knock around a gene there is a high probability that youâ€™ll perturb multiple traits. Somethings the relationship between variation on a gene and pathology is more straightforward. Some of the genes responsible for [normal human variation in pigmentation](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=oca2+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) were originally of interest due to their implication in albinism, which is a disease with some non-trivial health consequences.
