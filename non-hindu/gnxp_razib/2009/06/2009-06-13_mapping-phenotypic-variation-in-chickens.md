Mapping phenotypic variation in chickens

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/journal.pgen.1000512.g001-747389.jpg)  
PLoS Genetics has [a nice paper](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000512#pgen-1000512-g002) identifying copy-number polymorphism in the transcription factor SOX5 as the causal mutation leading to the pea-comb phenotype (the bottom panels on the right) in chickens. The mutation leads to more widespread expression of the gene at a particular developmental time point, which presumably represses comb formation.
