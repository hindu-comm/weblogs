How socially polarized are Iranians?

![irantightclothes.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/irantightclothes.jpg?resize=250%2C290)![irantightclothes.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/irantightclothes.jpg?resize=250%2C290)There is currently a [presidential election going on in Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_presidential_election,_2009). The buffoon Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is running against a “reformist,” Mir-Hossein Mousavi. There is some controversy because Mousavi’s wife, Zahra Rahnavard, has been active in the campaign, and held hands with him in public! (and I thought that the principal banned [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_display_of_affection)?) It is a quirk, though not too significant, that both candidates are from ethnic minorities. Mousavi is an ethnic Azeri Turk (as is the Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) while the buffoon is [Talysh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talysh_language) (the Talysh language is mutually intelligible with standard Persian). But the bigger story is the social fissures in Iranian society between urban and rural, rich and poor, educated and not educated. The standard narrative is that the elites support reformists who wish to liberalize Iranian society, while the poor back populists like the buffoon who promise more bread and religious revival.  
This makes me wonder, how polarized is Iranian society? A few years ago *Free Inquiry* had a piece up, [The Next Secular Revolution?](http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/Dacey_25_4.htm), which played up the undercurrent of anti-clericalism extant within Iran. But I was skeptical, and poking through the [World Values Surey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) makes me even more skeptical. Iranians might be tired of Mullahcracy, but they’re no free thinkers. Rather, they’re moderately conservative people who have lost their taste for religious radicalism. Or have they? One of the issues that Westerners have is that the Iranians who are informants for reporters are no doubt going to be sampled from the educated elites. This might selection-bias the sample.  
So I broke down various questions by education in the World Values Survey for Iran. The N’s for each class are on the order of 500. Most of the questions have 4 or 10 categories. I present extreme responses. If the questions have a form such as “Very strongly agree,” then there were four options.
