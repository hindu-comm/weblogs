The domestication of chili peppers

![356px-Habanero_closeup_edit.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/356px-Habanero_closeup_edit.jpg?resize=200%2C437)![356px-Habanero_closeup_edit.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/356px-Habanero_closeup_edit.jpg?resize=200%2C437)Regular readers know that [hot sauce](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=hot+sauce+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) and chili peppers are important to me. Currently I’ve taken to using dried habaneros instead of hot sauces, powders or fresh peppers. The last taste the best, but they don’t always keep, and sauces are a mess. As for powders, there’s always the problem of inhalation. In any case, from *The American Journal of Botany*, [Genetic diversity and structure in semiwild and domesticated chiles (*Capsicum annuum*; Solanaceae) from Mexico](http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/96/6/1190):

> The chile of Mesoamerica,*Capsicum annuum*, is one of five > domesticatedchiles in the Americas. Among the chiles, it varies the > mostin size, form, and color of its fruits. Together with maize,*C. > annuum*is one of the principal elements of the neotropicaldiets of > Mesoamerican civilizations. Despite the great economicand cultural > importance of*C. annuum*both worldwide and in Mexico,however, very > little is known about its geographic origin andnumber of > domestications. Here we sampled a total of 80 accessionsfrom Mexico > (58 semiwild and 22 domesticated) and examined nucleotidesequence > diversity at three single- or low-copy nuclear loci,*Dhn, G3pdh*, > and*Waxy*. Across the three loci, we found an averagereduction of > ca. 10% in the diversity of domesticates relativeto semiwild chiles > and geographic structure within Mexican populations.The Yucatan > Peninsula contained a large number of haplotypes,many of which were > unique, suggesting an important region ofchile domestication and > center of diversity. **The present samplingof loci did not conclusively resolve the number and locationof domestications, but several lines of evidence suggest multipleindependent domestications from widely distributed progenitorpopulations.**
