Fate vs. Control by nation

The World Values Survey has a question of the form:

> Some people believe that individuals can decide their own destiny, > while others think that it is impossible to escape a predetermined > fate. Please tell me which comes closest to your view on this scale on > which 1 means “everything in life is determined by fate,” and 10 means > that “people shape their fate themselves.”

Below the fold are the percentages in selected nations which picked “10,” which is basically the least fatalistic position.
