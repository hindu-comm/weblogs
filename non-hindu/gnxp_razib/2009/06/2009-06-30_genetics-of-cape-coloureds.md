Genetics of Cape Coloureds

A few weeks ago I noticed that the Wikipedia entry for [Cape Coloureds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_coloureds) has little fleshed out information on their genetics. As a mixed population it seems that people would be interested, but has always been hard to find anything from Google Scholar on this topic. But the recent Tishkoff paper, [The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1172257), has some data. You can find a [full post at my other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/06/who_are_the_cape_coloureds_of.php), but it seems that not only are the Cape Coloureds substantially European, Khoisan and Bantu, but likely they’re also substantially Indian, and there is a definite East Asian element, no doubt from slaves brought from Maritime Southeast Asia by the [VOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). There’s also a lot of variance in this particular sample of Cape Coloureds. Assuming this is representative I would offer that the main reason is that the Coloured population has historically had many people entering it from other groups, and, many leaving to other groups.
