The greatest good for the greatest number?

![Neda2.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Neda2.jpg?resize=100%2C132)![Neda2.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/Neda2.jpg?resize=100%2C132)Over the past week the political events in Iran have saturated the news. But the reality is that [Pakistan still has an enormous refugee problem](https://news.google.com/news/more?pz=1&ned=us&cf=all&ncl=dF8EqhxAatpmbRMo2xazRVNUzS_WM), right next door to Iran in fact. It’s striking though that there is little news coverage of this at this moment, at the same time that the public and media’s imagination has been captured by the shocking death of [Neda Soltai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neda_Soltai), the young Iranian woman whose death was caught on video.  
Below the fold are the number of tweets on [\#neda](https://twitter.com/#search?q=NEDA%20OR%20%23neda) vs. [\#pakistan](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23pakistan) (currently the \#pakistan hash-tag is concerned with a cricket win by their national team).
