Sunshine and SEC Football

The [cover story](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1161286/1/index.htm) for Sports Illustrated two weeks ago described the dominance of the South Eastern Conference (SEC) in US college football.

> “More players are invited to the NFL combine each year from the SEC > than from any other conference,” Ole Miss’s \[Head Coach\] Nutt says > when asked about the quality of the athletes who compete in the > league. “The most players drafted just about every year going back 10 > years come from the SEC.” Indeed, dating to the 2000 NFL draft, the > conference has had 400 players selected; the next-best league is the > ACC, with 364. >
> It’s no mystery to Nutt why an SEC team has won the BCS national > championship each of the last three years (Florida in 2006 and 2008, > LSU in 2007) and is favored to produce the champ again this season. “I > watch \[teams in\] other conferences all the time and I think, Boy, > I’d like to play them,” Nutt says.

But, for GNXP readers, this is the most fun comment.

> It all starts with recruiting. Nutt says that players from the South, > particularly those who reside in Florida, become better college > players than kids from other parts of the country, though he can’t > explain why. “Maybe it’s the sunshine,” he says. “In any given year an > average of 335 young men \[from Florida\] sign with Division I > schools.

You’ve got Wisconsin, Minnesota, Purdue, > Virginia, Virginia Tech. You’ve got schools from North Carolina. > They’re all down there, and they’re coming for the speed. We signed > nine from Florida this year. Nine!”

Yeah! It’s the “sunshine” that causes the “quality of the athletes” in the SEC. Caste Football [calculates](http://castefootball.us/viewarticle.asp?sportID=3&teamID=0&ID=23486) that the percentage of white starters at SEC teams is 25%, lower than any other major conference.

Of course, from a GNXP point of view, sunshine may be actually have played a role, but not in the way that Nutt implies . . .
