GWAS, population structure and the Han Chinese

Two new articles in AJHG, [Genomic Dissection of Population Substructure of Han Chinese and Its Implication in Association Studies](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00470-4):

> To date, most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and studies of > fine-scale population structure have been conducted primarily on > Europeans. Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, > composing 20% of the entire global human population, is largely > underrepresented in such studies. A well-recognized challenge is the > fact that population structure can cause spurious associations in > GWAS. In this study, we examined population substructures in a diverse > set of over 1700 Han Chinese samples collected from 26 regions across > China, each genotyped at âˆ¼160K single-nucleotide polymorphisms > (SNPs). Our results showed that the Han Chinese population is > intricately substructured, with the main observed clusters > corresponding roughly to northern Han, central Han, and southern Han. > However, simulated case-control studies showed that genetic > differentiation among these clusters, although very small (FST = > 0.0002 âˆ¼0.0009), is sufficient to lead to an inflated rate of > false-positive results even when the sample size is moderate. The top > two SNPs with the greatest frequency differences between the northern > Han and southern Han clusters (FST \> 0.06) were found in the FADS2 > gene, which associates with the fatty acid composition in > phospholipids, and in the HLA complex P5 gene (HCP5), which associates > with HIV infection, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. Ingenuity > Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that most differentiated genes among > clusters are involved in cardiac arteriopathy (p \< 10âˆ’101). These > signals indicating significant differences among Han Chinese > subpopulations should be carefully explained in case they are also > detected in association studies, especially when sample sources are > diverse.

And, [Genetic Structure of the Han Chinese Population Revealed by Genome-wide SNP Variation](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(09)00471-6):

> Population stratification is a potential problem for genome-wide > association studies (GWAS), confounding results and causing spurious > associations. Hence, understanding how allele frequencies vary across > geographic regions or among subpopulations is an important prelude to > analyzing GWAS data. Using over 350,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs in > over 6000 Han Chinese samples from ten provinces of China, our study > revealed a one-dimensional â€œnorth-southâ€? population structure and > a close correlation between geography and the genetic structure of the > Han Chinese. The north-south population structure is consistent with > the historical migration pattern of the Han Chinese population. > Metropolitan cities in China were, however, more diffused > â€œoutliers,â€? probably because of the impact of modern migration of > peoples. At a very local scale within the Guangdong province, we > observed evidence of population structure among dialect groups, > probably on account of endogamy within these dialects. Via simulation, > we show that empirical levels of population structure observed across > modern China can cause spurious associations in GWAS if not properly > handled. In the Han Chinese, geographic matching is a good proxy for > genetic matching, particularly in validation and candidate-gene > studies in which population stratification cannot be directly accessed > and accounted for because of the lack of genome-wide data, with the > exception of the metropolitan cities, where geographical location is > no longer a good indicator of ancestral origin. Our findings are > important for designing GWAS in the Chinese population, an activity > that is expected to intensify greatly in the near future.
