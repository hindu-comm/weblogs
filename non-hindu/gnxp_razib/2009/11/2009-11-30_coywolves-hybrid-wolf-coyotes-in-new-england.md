Coywolves; hybrid wolf-coyotes in New England?

[This article](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20091130/COLUMNISTS01/91130003/%E2%80%98Coywolves-a-product-of-evolution) pointed me to this interesting paper, [Rapid adaptive evolution of northeastern coyotes via hybridization with wolves](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/09/23/rsbl.2009.0575.abstract?sid=53faa215-ec88-49c2-a0d4-f5c6dc214854):

> The dramatic expansion of the geographical range of coyotes over the > last 90 years is partly explained by changes to the landscape and > local extinctions of wolves, but hybridization may also have > facilitated their movement. We present mtDNA sequence data from 686 > eastern coyotes and measurements of 196 skulls related to their > two-front colonization pattern. We find evidence for hybridization > with Great Lakes wolves only along the northern front, which is > correlated with larger skull size, increased sexual dimorphism and a > five times faster colonization rate than the southern front. > Northeastern haplotype diversity is low, suggesting that this > population was founded by very few females moving across the Saint > Lawrence River. This northern front then spread south and west, > eventually coming in contact with an expanding front of non-hybrid > coyotes in western New York and Pennsylvania. We suggest that > hybridization with wolves in Canada introduced adaptive variation that > contributed to larger size, which in turn allowed eastern coyotes to > better hunt deer, allowing a more rapid colonization of new areas than > coyotes without introgressed wolf genes. **Thus, hybridization is a > conduit by which genetic variation from an extirpated species has been > reintroduced into northeastern USA, enabling northeastern coyotes to > occupy a portion of the niche left vacant by wolves.**

Here is a figure which shows the distribution of mtDNA lineages geographically:

The gray sections of the bar graph represent coyotes. The non-gray are non-coyotes.
