How European is New England…not as much as I thought

One hypothesis I have held is that there is a cultural gap in the United States whereby the West Coast and the Northeast are more “European” than the rest of the nation. So you have ideas crop up like [Jesusland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesusland_map). I decided to see if I could compare European nations and American subregions using the [WVS](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/), [Eurobarometer](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/05/atheist-societies.php) and [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08). I looked at two issues:

1\) Belief in God  
2) Nationalism

These two had equivalent questions in the 2000s for the WVS & GSS. I created an index of religiosity whereby:

Atheists & agnostic = 0  
Higher Power = 1  
Theist = 2

And:  
Very Proud of Country = 3  
Somewhat Proud of Country = 2  
Not Very Proud = 1  
Not Proud at All = 0

On these two traits I don’t see much of a Blue America + Europe clade….

**Note:** Limited GSS results to the 2000s.
