Brown people are susceptible to diabetes

![gandhi2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gandhi2.png?resize=200%2C214)![gandhi2.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/gandhi2.png?resize=200%2C214)In medical news which won’t be surprising to anyone, [Ethnic Variation in Fat and Lean Body Mass and the Association with Insulin Resistance](http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/jc.2009-1030v1):

> Objective: Our objective was to compare total body fat to lean mass ratio (F:LM) in Aboriginal, Chinese, European, and South Asian individuals with differences in insulin resistance.  
> …  
> Results: After adjustment for confounders and at a given body fat, > South Asian men had less lean mass than Aboriginal \[3.42 kg less; 95% > confidence interval (CI) = 1.55-5.29\], Chinese (3.01 kg less; 95% CI > = 1.33-4.70), and European (3.57 kg less; 95% CI = 1.82-5.33) men, > whereas South Asian women had less lean mass than Aboriginal (1.98 kg > less; 95% CI = 0.45-3.50), Chinese (2.24 kg less; 95% CI = 0.81-3.68), > and European (2.97 kg less; 95% CI = 1.67-4.27) women. In adjusted > models, F:LM was higher in South Asian compared with Chinese and > European men and higher in South Asian compared with Aboriginal, Chinese, and European women (P \< 0.01 for all). **Insulin and HOMA were greatest in South Asians after adjustment; however, these differences were no longer apparent when F:LM was considered.**  
> Conclusions: South Asians have a phenotype of high fat mass and low lean mass, which may account for greater levels of insulin and HOMA compared with other ethnic groups.

HOMA = [homeostatic model assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment), used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function. The second bolded part is important, **you can change your fat to lean mass ratio.** Change what you eat, and exercise. I’ve seen data from England, where there are large numbers of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, that the latter are in a higher risk category than the former when it comes to adult onset diabetes.  
**Update:** A comment:

> Minor quibble: Please be so kind as to use the term ‘type 2 diabetes’ in the future.  
> A large amount of type 1 diabetics get the disease in adulthood and these results have zero relevance for them or that disease.  
> It’s incidentally (now that we are splitting hairs…) also incorrect to > use the term IDDM (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) as a shorthand > for type 1 diabetes, which is something you often see people do > without thinking. A recent Danish study found that half of all type 2 > diabetes patients will need insulin treatment within 6 years of > diagnosis, which probably means that a majority of all insulin-dependent diabetics are type 2 patients, considering that they make out the great majority of all diabetics (in DK, 80-90% of all diabetics have type 2 diabetes).
