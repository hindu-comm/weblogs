The moon is not such a harsh mistress

[Dynamic of the Cats](http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2009/11/water_on_the_moon.php) as some commentary on the [LCROSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCROSS) landing the moon. The “big news” is the very high confidence now that one can put on the proposition that the moon does have water. Since humans are mostly water by weight, this is very important when assessing the practical difficulties of colonization or settlement. Would have been a drag to lug or synthesize H₂O.
