Discussion of CRU Materials

The debate over global warming is relevant to GNXP (previous posts [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003472.html) and [here](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001558.html)) not so much because our readers are interested in climate science but because the dynamics of the debate — scientific “consensus” versus politically incorrect minority view — have relevance to various debates over human biodiversity. With that background, I would be curious to know what posts/arguments/sites other GNXPers find most relevant and compelling. My three favorites are:

1\) [Willis Eschenbach](http://omniclimate.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/willis-vs-the-cru-a-history-of-foi-evasion/) on his attempts to use the Freedom Of Information Act to access CRU data and model details.

2\) [Eric Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1447) on details of the released code. When serious software experts like Raymond start accusing climate scientists of “blatant data-cooking,” the “consensus” started to looks much weaker.

3\) [Gavin Schmidt](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/the-cru-hack-context/) at Real Climate in defense of the scientists at CRU. Whatever the criticisms of Schmidt from folks like [Steve McIntyre](http://camirror.wordpress.com/), you have to be impressed with his willingness to take on all comers.

In the spirit of (United States) Thanksgiving, I am thankful that the human genetics community seems to have a much broader diversity of opinion and greater committment to transparency and reproducible research than the climate science community.
