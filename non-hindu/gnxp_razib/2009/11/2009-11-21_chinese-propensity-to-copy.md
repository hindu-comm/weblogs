Chinese propensity to copy

No, this isn’t about intellectual property issues and piracy. [Whole Genome Distribution and Ethnic Differentiation of Copy Number Variation in Caucasian and Asian Populations](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0007958):

> Although copy number variation (CNV) has recently received much > attention as a form of structure variation within the human genome, > knowledge is still inadequate on fundamental CNV characteristics such > as occurrence rate, genomic distribution and ethnic differentiation. > In the present study, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mapping 500K > Array to discover and characterize CNVs in the human genome and to > study ethnic differences of CNVs between Caucasians and Asians.

Here’s a figure which shows the distributions, CHI = Chinese and CAU = Caucasion.\*

The big picture issue is CNVs may be important in gene expression, the paper cites a number that \~18% of the variance in this may be due to CNVs. An interesting recent case was CNV differences in regards to the gene which codes for amylase, with some researchers suggesting this is due to selection for the ability to digest starches for agriculturalists. In relation to the title, there might not be anything there:

> A third example of ethnic variation is that the genomic coverage of > CNVs in Asians is 1.6-fold higher than that in seen in Caucasians, > indicating that genome variants were more common in Asians than in > Caucasians. Further sensitivity analysis resulted in an only 1.2-fold > elevated genomic coverage of Chinese CNVs compared to Caucasian CNVs. > Considering different DNA extraction methods for Chinese and Caucasian > samples, **the ethnic differences seen in genomic coverage may be > partially due to different binding affinities of diverse DNA extracts > to the SNP chip array.**

\* If they use “Caucasian” for European origin people, why not “Mongoloid” for Chinese?
