FOXP2 in Nature

[Human-specific transcriptional regulation of CNS development genes by FOXP2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7270/abs/nature08549.html):

> …It has been proposed that the amino acid composition in the human > variant of FOXP2 has undergone accelerated evolution, and this > two-amino-acid change occurred around the time of language emergence > in humans…However, this remains controversial, and whether the > acquisition of these amino acids in human FOXP2 has any functional > consequence in human neurons remains untested. Here we demonstrate > that these two human-specific amino acids alter FOXP2 function by > conferring differential transcriptional regulation in vitro. **We > extend these observations in vivo to human and chimpanzee brain, and > use network analysis to identify novel relationships among the > differentially expressed genes.** These data provide experimental > support for the functional relevance of changes in FOXP2 that occur on > the human lineage, highlighting specific pathways with direct > consequences for human brain development and disease in the central > nervous system (CNS). Because FOXP2 has an important role in speech and language in humans, the identified targets may have a critical function in the development and evolution of language circuitry in humans.

[Ed Young has a long entry](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/11/revisiting_foxp2_and_the_origins_of_language.php) on this paper, along with context.

**Update:** Someone on Twitter is suggesting we create a transgenic. Which direction?
