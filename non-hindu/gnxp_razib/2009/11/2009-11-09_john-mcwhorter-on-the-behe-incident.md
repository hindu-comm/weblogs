John McWhorter on the Behe incident

He [addresses the Behe diavlog](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/23713?in=00:00&out=07:09). Sort of. McWhorter states that he did not find the rebuttals to the arguments in Michael Behe’s [Edge of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Evolution-Search-Limits-Darwinism/dp/B002IT5OOS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257753674&sr=8-1) persuasive. Fair enough, but I would be curious as to what other books on evolution he has read (I think he mentioned Sean Carroll?). The math in something like John Maynard Smith’s [Evolutionary Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198502311/geneexpressio-20/) is really not that hard (mostly algebra). One of the major problems I have with intelligent, open-minded people, who have looked into the “debate” and are not convinced about evolution is that **they know the terms of the “argument” only in the context of responses to the talking points of the antagonists of evolutionary biology.** The primary literature in the field is rich, and at the most basic level rather accessible. It would be as if one’s knowledge of quantum physics was constrained by the lines of response to the nonsense in [What the Bleep Do We Know!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Bleep_Do_We_Know!%3F).
