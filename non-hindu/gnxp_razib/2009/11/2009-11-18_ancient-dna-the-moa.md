Ancient DNA & the moa

[The evolutionary history of the extinct ratite moa and New Zealand Neogene paleogeography](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/17/0906660106.short?rss=1):

> …We synthesize mitochondrial phylogenetic information from 263 > subfossil moa specimens from across NZ with morphological, ecological, > and new geological data to create the first comprehensive phylogeny, > taxonomy, and evolutionary timeframe for all of the species of an > extinct order. We also present an important new > geological/paleogeographical model of late Cenozoic NZ, which suggests > that terrestrial biota on the North and South Island landmasses were > isolated for most of the past 20-30 Ma. The data reveal that the > patterns of genetic diversity within and between different moa clades > reflect a complex history following a major marine transgression in > the Oligocene, affected by marine barriers, tectonic activity, and > glacial cycles. Surprisingly, the remarkable morphological radiation > of moa appears to have occurred much more recently than previous early > Miocene (ca. 15 Ma) estimates, and was coincident with the accelerated > uplift of the Southern Alps just ca. 5-8.5 **Ma. Together with recent > fossil evidence, these data suggest that the recent evolutionary > history of nearly all of the iconic NZ terrestrial biota occurred > principally on just the South Island.**

“Subfossil” means that it hasn’t totally fossilized and one can extract organic material from the remains.
