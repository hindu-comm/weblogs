The quest for common variants & cognition

[A genome-wide study of common SNPs and CNVs in cognitive performance in the CANTAB](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/18/23/4650?rss=1):

> Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are commonly accompanied > by cognitive impairments that are treatment resistant and crucial to > functional outcome. There has been great interest in studying > cognitive measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders, with > the hope that their genetic basis will be clearer. To investigate > this, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 11 > cognitive phenotypes from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test > Automated Battery. We showed these measures to be heritable by > comparing the correlation in 100 monozygotic and 100 dizygotic twin > pairs. The full battery was tested in 750 subjects, and for spatial > and verbal recognition memory, we investigated a further 500 > individuals to search for smaller genetic effects. We were unable to > find any genome-wide significant associations with either SNPs or > common copy number variants. Nor could we formally replicate any > polymorphism that has been previously associated with cognition, > although we found a weak signal of lower than expected P-values for > variants in a set of 10 candidate genes. We additionally investigated > SNPs in genomic loci that have been shown to harbor rare variants that > associate with neuropsychiatric disorders, to see if they showed any > suggestion of association when considered as a separate set. Only > NRXN1 showed evidence of significant association with cognition. > **These results suggest that common genetic variation does not > strongly influence cognition in healthy subjects and that cognitive > measures do not represent a more tractable genetic trait than clinical > endpoints such as schizophrenia.** We discuss a possible role for rare > variation in cognitive genomics.

[David Goldstein](http://www.genome.duke.edu/people/faculty/goldstein/) is one of the authors. I wonder if this influenced his [views on the evolution of intelligence](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/09/david_goldstein_on_the_hapmap.php).
