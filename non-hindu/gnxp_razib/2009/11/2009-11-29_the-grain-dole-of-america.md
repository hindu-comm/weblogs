The grain dole of America

Ben points to the a new article in *The New York Times*, [Across U.S., Food Stamp Use Soars and Stigma Fades](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/us/29foodstamps.html). The [county-by-county data](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/28/us/20091128-foodstamps.html) are of interest. I’ve just snatched the csv file, which they made available. Andrew Gelman has [a modest critique](http://scienceblogs.com/appliedstatistics/2009/11/50_of_kids_are_on_food_stamps.php) of the assertion that 50% of children are on food stamps at some point in their childhood. The variance in utilization rates of the program by region (50% in California vs. 98% in Missouri) of those eligible, as well as the near saturation of utilization in much of the [Black Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(U.S._region)) and highland South (the Appalachians and the Ozarks), implies to me that while in some American subcultures the program is seen as a stop-gap in others it is a background condition of life. A minimum income guarantee or grain dole basically. Also, I recently heard a radio interview with Kevin Concannon, an under secretary of agriculture. In response to criticism of misrepresentation of the results of reports of hunger in America his stance was basically “statistics, schmamistics.”

The reason that I’m fixating a bit on the issue of hunger in America is that we’re also told that there’s an “obesity epidemic” in this country, in particular among the lower classes. Often from the same policy elites who point to long lines at soup kitchens as evidence of a surfeit of food! To be hungry sometimes is uncomfortable, I know this personally, **I am hungry sometimes.** Though for me it has to do with the fact that I don’t think that the immediate response to hunger always has to be food to satiate the pangs (I don’t like to eat past a certain hour). Nutritional belt tightening isn’t necessarily a bad thing, [remember that the Great Depression saw an increase in life expectancy](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/09/great-depression-added-62-years-to-life.php).
