My review of The Faith Instinct

Over at [ScienceBlogs](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/11/the_faith_instinct_how_religio.php) now. Itâ€™s a dense book and I only focused on a few major elements. Like the God of the philosophers sometimes it seems like attempts to analyze religion always have to face up to the fact that the phenomenon is awesomely complex, and we look through the glass darkly.
