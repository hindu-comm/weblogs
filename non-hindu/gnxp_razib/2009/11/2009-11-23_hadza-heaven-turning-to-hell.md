Hadza heaven turning to hell

*National Geographic* has an interesting [piece of ethnographic travel writing](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/12/hadza/finkel-text) up on the [Hadza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people) of Tanzania. The Hadza are one of the few remaining hunter-gather populations in the world, and their language is an isolate which has clicks. There’s a bit too much “noble savage” archetype loaded into the piece, but this portion is of note:

> **The chief reason the Hadza have been able to maintain their > lifestyle so long is that their homeland has never been an inviting > place.** The soil is briny; fresh water is scarce; the bugs can be > intolerable. For tens of thousands of years, it seems, no one else > wanted to live here. So the Hadza were left alone. Recently, however, > escalating population pressures have brought a flood of people into > Hadza lands. The fact that the Hadza are such gentle stewards of the > land has, in a way, hurt them–the region has generally been viewed by > outsiders as empty and unused, a place sorely in need of development. The Hadza, who by nature are not a combative people, have almost always moved away rather than fight. But now there is nowhere to retreat.

Like all extant hunter-gatherer populations\* the Hadza exist precisely because their territory is unappealing or unsuitable for agriculture. It follows that the simplicity of the Hadza may be a function of the spare and marginal nature of the ecology with they depend upon for their livelihood, not the style of their livelihood. I am willing to hazard that hunter-gatherers more fertile territory would still have less inequality and social complexity than equivalent agriculturalists, but the hard-scrabble hunter-gatherers who remain surely give us an extremely distorted view of that mode of life.  
\* Many which anthropologists were able to study in the 20th century are no longer hunter-gatherers, so the presently extant list is shrinking fast.
