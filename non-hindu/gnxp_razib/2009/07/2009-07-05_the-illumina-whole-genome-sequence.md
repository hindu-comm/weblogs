The Illumina whole-genome-sequence

I notice that *Fortune* has a story on personal genomics up, [Genetic sequencing gets personal Biotech firm Illumina will sequence your entire genetic code — and throw in a Mac — for \$48,000](http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/02/technology/illumina_gene_dna_sequencing.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2009070215):

> So far, personalized genomics make up just a small fraction of > Illumina’s revenue. High costs keep sequencing out of reach for most people. But prices will fall substantially as the technology improves. **In fact experts say costs could reach \$1000 within three to five years, making more people privy to their entire genetic code.**  
> …  
> **One area Illumina is not diving into is sequence analysis.** > Instead, it is partnering with genomics companies Navigenics, 23andMe, > deCODE Genetics (DCGN), and Knome, which are developing platforms to > decipher the data generated by Illumina. So far, the partners are > keeping mum on how much they plan to charge the customers Illumina sends their way. Based on the costs of their current genotyping services, prices could range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

[Dan MacArthur covered the Illumina story](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/illumina_launches_personal_gen.php) last month in more depth.
