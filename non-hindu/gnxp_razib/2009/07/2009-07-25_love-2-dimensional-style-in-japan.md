Love 2-dimensional style in Japan

[Love in 2-D](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26FOB-2DLove-t.html?_r=3&ref=global-home&pagewanted=print):

> Nisan didn’t mean to fall in love with Nemutan. Their first encounter > — at a comic-book convention that Nisan’s gaming friends dragged him > to in Tokyo — was serendipitous. Nisan was wandering aimlessly around > the crowded exhibition hall when he suddenly found himself staring > into Nemutan’s bright blue eyes. In the beginning, they were just > friends. Then, when Nisan got his driver’s license a few months later, > he invited Nemutan for a ride around town in his beat-up Toyota. They > went to a beach, not far from the home he shares with his parents in a > suburb of Tokyo. It was the first of many road trips they would take > together. As they got to know each other, they traveled hundreds of > miles west — to Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, sleeping in his car or crashing > on friends’ couches to save money. They took touristy pictures under > cherry trees, frolicked like children on merry-go-rounds and slurped > noodles on street corners. Now, after three years together, they are virtually inseparable. “I’ve experienced so many amazing things because of her,” Nisan told me, rubbing Nemutan’s leg warmly. “She has really changed my life.”  
> Nemutan doesn’t really have a leg. She’s a stuffed pillowcase — a 2-D > depiction of a character, Nemu, from an X-rated version of a PC video > game called Da Capo, printed on synthetic fabric. In the game, which > is less a game than an interactive visual novel about a schoolyard > romance, Nemu is the loudmouthed little sister of the main character, > whom she calls nisan, or “big brother,” a nickname Nisan adopted as > his own when he met Nemu. When I joined the couple for lunch at their > favorite all-you-can-eat salad bar in the Tokyo suburb of Hachioji, he > insisted on being called only by this new nickname, addressing his > body-pillow girlfriend using the suffix “tan” to show how much he > adored her. Nemutan is 10, maybe 12 years old and wears a little blue > bikini and gold ribbons in her hair. Nisan knows she’s not real, but that hasn’t stopped him from loving her just the same. “Of course she’s my girlfriend,” he said, widening his eyes as if shocked by the question. “I have real feelings for her.”
