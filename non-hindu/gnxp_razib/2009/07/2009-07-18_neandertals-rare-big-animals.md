Neandertals, rare big animals

There’s a new paper on ancient DNA out, [Targeted Retrieval and Analysis of Five Neandertal mtDNA Genomes](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/5938/318):

> Analysis of Neandertal DNA holds great potential for investigating the > population history of this group of hominins, but progress has been > limited due to the rarity of samples and damaged state of the DNA. We > present a method of targeted ancient DNA sequence retrieval that > greatly reduces sample destruction and sequencing demands and use this > method to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes > of five Neandertals from across their geographic range. **We find that > mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals that lived 38,000 to 70,000 > years ago was approximately one-third of that in contemporary modern > humans.** Together with analyses of mtDNA protein evolution, these data suggest that the long-term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes.

The comparison with modern humans is interesting and informative: **we’re a rather homogeneous species with a small long term effective population size.** This ratchets down how numerous Neandertals were to breeding populations on the order of 1,000-10,000 individuals. Seeing as how Neandertals ranged from Spain to Kazakhstan it seems that they were likely spread rather thin then.  
Here’s *Nature*‘s [take](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090717/full/news.2009.701.html):

> The difference implies that between 38,000 and 70,000 years ago, > Neanderthals lived in smaller, more isolated pockets. The team > estimates that around 270 to 3,500 breeding females would have lived > at any one time as part of a total population that would have included their families and non-breeding Neanderthals. The team’s estimate of the number of breeding females is in a similar range to a previous estimate that was based on a single Neanderthal genome3.  
> But anthropologist Anna Degioanni at the University of the > Mediterranean in Marseilles, France, notes that the region of mtDNA > the Briggs group studied does not vary as much as other regions, such as the one her group used to identify different subgroups of Neanderthals earlier this year4. That may mean that the new study underestimates the genetic diversity of Neanderthals, she believes.  
> Both Degioanni and Briggs expect that future studies of nuclear DNA, which is more complex and contains more potential variations, will help settle the diversity question more definitively.
