The evolution of blogging

Lots of chatter about [The Blogosphere 2.0](http://www.apt11d.com/2009/07/the-blogosphere-20.html), a post which has 7 bullet points:  
– The A-List Doesn’t Matter Anymore  
– It’s all about niche blogs  
– Blogger Burn Out  
– Reader burn out  
– MSM yawns  
– Huffington Post.  
– Twitter and Facebook  
Not much I’d disagree with in the generality. Multiple times that politics/general interest weblogs have linked to me it is noted that I’m a “specialist/technical weblog,” but I really think *everyone* is focused on a specific area at this point. It’s just that political and policy weblogs seem to think everyone has a general interest in their topic. Also, I do think the “A-List” matters a little more than the author of the above post, especially for new blogs who just aren’t on anyone’s radar.
