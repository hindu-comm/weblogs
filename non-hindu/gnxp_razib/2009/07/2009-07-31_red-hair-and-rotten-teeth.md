Red hair and rotten teeth

[Genetic Variations Associated With Red Hair Color and Fear of Dental Pain, Anxiety Regarding Dental Care and Avoidance of Dental Care](http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/abstract/140/7/896):

> **Background**. Red hair color is caused by variants of the > melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. People with naturally red hair > are resistant to subcutaneous local anesthetics and, therefore, may > experience increased anxiety regarding dental care. The authors tested > the hypothesis that having natural red hair color, a MC1R gene variant > or both could predict a patient’s experiencing dental care-related > anxiety and dental care avoidance. >
> **Methods**. The authors enrolled 144 participants (67 natural > red-haired and 77 dark-haired) aged 18 to 41 years in a > cross-sectional observational study. Participants completed validated > survey instruments designed to measure general and dental > care-specific anxiety, fear of dental pain and previous dental care > avoidance. The authors genotyped participants’ blood samples to detect > variants associated with natural red hair color. >
> **Results**. Eighty-five participants had MC1R gene variants (65 of > the 67 red-haired participants and 20 of the 77 dark-haired > participants) (P \< .001). Participants with MC1R gene variants > reported significantly more dental care-related anxiety and fear of > dental pain than did participants with no MC1R gene variants. They > were more than twice as likely to avoid dental care as were the > participants with no MC1R gene variants, even after the authors > controlled for general trait anxiety and sex.
