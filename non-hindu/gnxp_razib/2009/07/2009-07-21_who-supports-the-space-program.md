Who supports the space program?

I just listened to a radio segment on public sentiments toward the Apollo space program expenditures in hindsight. The polling had a small N, 3 people in Los Angeles on the street. But it got me wondering: **who supports the space program?** There is a variable in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08), NATSPAC, with a large sample size, which states:

> We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be > solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these > problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think > we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the > right amount.

I limited the results to between 1998-2008. Below are the demographic trends.

***Now, sorted….***

The secular, the intelligent, the educated and males exhibit inordinate support for a space program. In contrast, blacks, women, the stupid and the extreme poor (that is *family income* below \$25,000 in the past 10 years) are skeptical of funding for the space program. I was surprised by the lack of difference in political clusters, with even a slight tilt toward liberals. I’ve heard the “rockets vs. butter” argument in public forums from Left-leaning individuals many times. In particular I recall as a child being annoyed at [Joseph P. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Patrick_Kennedy_II) for making a crass speech on the floor of the House of Representatives in this vein, suggesting that people starve on earth so that rockets may orbit above us.
