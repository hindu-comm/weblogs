The genetics of the descendants of the Garamantes

[First Genetic Insight into Libyan Tuaregs: A Maternal Perspective](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122394336/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

The Tuaregs of the Fezzan are almost certainly the remnants of what classical authors described as the [Garamantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamantes). [The Spitton](http://spittoon.23andme.com/2009/07/02/people-of-the-veil-new-study-reveals-clues-to-origins-of-the-nomadic-tuaregs/) covers most of the important points. Do note that mtDNA is a very small slice of the total picture of a population’s ancestry, and because it is passed through only \~1/2 of the population the long term effective population is even smaller than most loci (and so subject to greater genetic drift). Interestingly the greater proportion of Sub-Saharan African ancestry among the Tuaregs of the western Saharan give one a sense of the relative importance of various trans-Saharan trade routes in a quantitative sense.
