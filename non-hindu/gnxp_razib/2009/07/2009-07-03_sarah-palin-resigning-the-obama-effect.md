Sarah Palin resigning, the Obama effect?

[Palin announces resignation](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24497.html):

> Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin announced Friday that she was resigning her > office later this month, a stunning decision that could free her to > run for president more easily but also raises questions about her > political standing at home.  
> Palin disclosed the surprise news Friday afternoon from her home in > Wasilla with her husband, Todd, and Lt. Governor Sean Parnell, who the > governor said would take over the state on Saturday, July 25th.  
> By not running for re-election, Palin liberates herself from the > political constraints that come with running for president while still > in elected office.

It seems like a joke that someone who was governor of Alaska for such a short time could conceive of a presidential run, but Barack Obama didn’t even complete his term as senator, so the bar has been reset when it comes to political experience.  
**Update:** Since I posted this the whole announcement has gotten a lot weirder and murkier, so I don’t know what’s going on. Let’s hope she doesn’t decide to go hiking with Todd on the Appalachian Trail.  
**Update II:** CNN video of the Palin resignation speech below the fold….
