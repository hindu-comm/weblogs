Born to run

*[Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/barefoot/)* [has a](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/barefoot/) [piece up](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/barefoot/) [To Run Better, Start by Ditching Your Nikes](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/barefoot/), which discusses the controversy over the utility of running shoes. Of course the “support” that typical athletic shoes provide is real. when I switch to flip-flops in warm weather it takes a few days to get comfortable walking up or down hills. There is a shift in the emphasis of which tendons you have to work.
