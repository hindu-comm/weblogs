Jerry Fodor, Charles Darwin and Natural Selection

Over at [ScienceBlog](http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/blog/7256-fodor-darwin-eovlution-23267.html):

> **I would like to invite discussion on my paper**, [**On Fodor on > Darwin On Evolution**](http://cogprints.org/6417/3/fodorcomm.pdf), > which is a critique of Jerry Fodor’s [Hugues Leblanc > Lectures](http://philomtl.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/conferences-par-et-autour-de-jerry-fodor-a-luqam/) > at UQAM on “[What Darwin Got > Wrong](http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/faculty/Fodor/Fodor_Against_Darwinism.pdf)“…. >
> Jerry Fodor argues that Darwin was wrong about “natural selection” > because (1) it is only a tautology rather than a scientific law that > can support counterfactuals (“If X had happened, Y would have > happened”) and because (2) only minds can select. Hence Darwin’s > analogy with “artificial selection” by animal breeders was misleading > and evolutionary explanation is nothing but post-hoc historical > narrative. I argue that Darwin was right on all counts. Until Darwin’s > “tautology,” it had been believed that either (a) God had created all > organisms as they are, or (b) organisms had always been as they are. > Darwin revealed instead that (c) organisms have heritable traits that > evolved across time through random variation, with survival and > reproduction in (changing) environments determining (mindlessly) which > variants were successfully transmitted to the next generation. This > not only provided the (true) alternative (c), but also the methodology > for investigating which traits had been adaptive, how and why; it also > led to the discovery of the genetic mechanism of the encoding, > variation and evolution of heritable traits….
