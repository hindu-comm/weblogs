Dog legs: the genetics of short and stubby

[](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/newsblog/Dachshund.jpg)  
In recent years, the genetic mechanisms by which humans have generated massive phenotypic diversity in dogs have started to be uncovered. We now know, for example, much about the [genetics of pigmentation in dogs](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/pigment-type-switching-in-dogs.php), and a major gene [controlling body size](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/04/mendelian-variation-in-dog-size.php). This week, another phenotype–the short, stubby legs of some dog breeds (see right)–has [been revealed](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1173275) to have a simple, but interesting genetic basis.

The authors mapped the short leg phenotype to a small region on chromosome 18; further analysis revealed that the probable causal mutation is the insertion of a transcriptionally-active processed (ie. intronless) retrotransposed copy of the [FGF4 gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGF4). How this change leads to the phenotype itself is unknown, but understanding the mechanism will likely lead to some interesting biology.
