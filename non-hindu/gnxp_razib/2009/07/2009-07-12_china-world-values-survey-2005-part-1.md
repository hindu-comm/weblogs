China, World Values Survey 2005, part 1

[](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/uploaded_images/chinaProvinces-704548.gif)The [comments below](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/07/han-vs-tang.php) in regards to Chinese regionalism were informative. But for those of us without a more direct connection with China works can be wanting, so I thought looking at the [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/) would be interesting as there is a regional breakdown within it. Below the fold are a series of barplots where the different segments equal 100%. As you can see I took the first response and sorted by that. The sample sizes for some of the provinces are not high. Just ignore Chongqing where N = 1. But I am curious if Chinese readers are note regional differences just by visual inspection. Unfortunately I assume most non-Chinese (like myself) immediately know the location of only a few provinces, so the visual impact will be diminished for us. I will have a follow up post going down the list of WVS questions tomorrow. On the charts referring to “neighbors,” those are mentions of people they would like **not** to live next too. On the freedom question, it refers to how much freedom people feel they have in their life. You can go to the WVS site to clear up confusions in the legend…I produced the charts quick & dirty from my own copy of the WVS data set. In the future I’ll probably combine some of the provinces into macroregions (e.g., north, south, west) to increase sample size, but that’s for later. The only thing I wonder, what’s up with the wide variance in mentioned fear of the gay?
