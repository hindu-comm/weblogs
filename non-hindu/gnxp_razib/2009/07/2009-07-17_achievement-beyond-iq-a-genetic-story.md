Achievement Beyond IQ: A Genetic Story

It’s nice to see a bad idea demolished. And that’s what Greven, et al. do in “[More than just IQ](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122386058/abstract).” Their subtitle tells most of the story:

> School achievement is predicted by self-perceived abilities (SPAs)–but > for genetic rather than environmental reasons.

So asking kids “Are you good at math and English?” is indeed a good way to find out who is good at math and English; and basic twin-study methods show that the answers to those questions are in fact genetically-driven, with heritability of 51% and family environment explaining 2%.

Another family environment channel shot down. The authors drive that fact home:

> Despite the fact that **not a single twin or adoption study** has > investigated the genetic and environmental etiologies of SPAs, > researchers have cited environmental factors as a leading causal > explanation for constructs related to SPAs, such as self-efficacy…and > self-concept….. Moreover, one of the most established theories of SPAs > assumes that the development of individual differences in SPAs is > shaped primarily by parents’ beliefs, expectations, attitudes, and > behaviors…

Of course, the bulk of the academic literature will surely go right on assuming that self-construct is driven by shared environment: “Surely, you don’t mean to imply that an entire field of research was a waste of time, do you?” And in the policy and non-profit worlds these results won’t stop those “[Book in Every Home](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&site=book%2Bin%2Bevery%2Bhome%2522%2Bcampaign%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D%26aqi%3D&q=%22book+in+every+home%22+campaign)” campaigns. Alas….

More results:

The genetic component of self-perceived abilities (SPA) is a good predictor of achivement, after you control for IQ.

Even after you control for IQ and self-perceived ability, there’s still a big genetic residual–about as big as IQ’s genetic channel: So there are big genetic drivers of school achievement that don’t fit into the two simple boxes of IQ and SPA. Sounds like an opportunity for some productive data-mining….

The big genetic residual fits in with the fact that a person’s [income is vastly more heritable](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/07/inheritance-of-inequality-big-insight.php) than can be explained by the IQ channel alone. There are more things in gene expression, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your WAIS-R.
