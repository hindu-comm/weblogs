Porn & Rome

Rod Dreher has a post about the [The problem of pornography](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/07/the-problem-of-pornography.html). My question: how is porn fundamentally different from fantasizing? Is it because of the shift toward bizarre fetish porn which rescales your perceptions of normal? I’m generally skeptical of anecdotal arguments about how porn is “changing everything.” Because of my interest in Transhumanism and the Singularity I have run into people whose sexual outlets are skewed toward the virtual as opposed to the physical, and all seem to prefer the latter over the former. I won’t even get into the issues of causality when it comes to all the bizarre things which known serial killers engage in.

Also, Rod makes a reference to “Late-Roman” culture. The allusion is common among many Christian conservatives, and I think I know what he’s suggesting, that our society is becoming decadent, amoral, lacking spiritual values (he’s made the allusion [multiple times](http://www.beliefnet.com/Search/Site.aspx?q=Late-Roman)). Here’s my problem: **this doesn’t comport at all with even a *cursory* reading of Roman history that you could gain from Wikipedia.** The Late Roman period was one of the Chrisitanization of the Empire, and a resurgence of moralism among both pagans and Christians. Much of the Western Empire shifted more toward primary production and the modest economies of scale, and the specialization which allowed for the long distance trade of basic consumer and luxury goods diminished. In the East the Empire did not fall, but became progressively more Christian in its identity, as evidenced by the Christian [moral ethical influence on the codification of Roman law during the reign of Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis). The secular intellectual pursuits of the elite gave way to an emphasis on religious piety, study and endowment of monasteries and churches (see the life of [Cassiodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiodorus)).

In fact the revisionists who followed in the wake of Peter Brown and have reinterpreted the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as a [Transformation of the Roman World](http://www.esf.org/activities/research-networking-programmes/humanities-sch/completed-rnps-in-humanities/the-transformation-of-the-roman-world.html) point to the importance of Late Antiquity in setting the groundwork for the Christian civilization of Medieval Europe. “Late-Rome” was the time of the flourishing of [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) and [Ambrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose) in the West, the [Cappadocian Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocian_Fathers) in the East who are so important in the Greek Christian tradition. In general the revisionists might not deny the decline in material standards, in median affluence, but they emphasize the richness of cultural production, particularly religious cultural production.

Were public morals at the peak of the Empire such a high watermark? Augustus’ own family was wracked with debauchery to the point where he banished his own daughter. Though there were rumors about Tiberius, the perversions of Caligula and Nero are famous, and even the relatively innocuous Claudius married his niece. For those of you not up on your emperors, this is within the first century of the Empire. The Antonine Emperors were known to be moderate and virtuous in comparison to the prurience of the Julio-Claudians or the tyranny of Domitian, but Hadrian was certainly a pederast, and there are rumors about Trajan as well. Commodus of course made Andrew Johnson seem a model of sobriety and *gravitas* (this is the second century of the Empire).

At its peak the the Roman Empire was pagan, pluralist in religion and philosophy, and many of the autocrats flaunted personal morals which were in sharp contradiction to Christian virtue. It was **relatively** affluent (though we’re talking percentages on the margin of median wealth I suspect, not multiplicative) and militarily robust. In the later phase the Empire [imposed religious homogeneity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674016033/geneexpressio-20) on the elites in the form of Christianity, and the sort of public virtue which Augustus or Marcus Aurelius might have smiled upon became baked-into-the-cake of the ideology of the proto-monarchs which the emperors had become (although women such as Pulcharia and Theodora were generally the enforcers). Bread & circuses might have persisted in Rome up until the Gothic Wars, across much of the Empire there was a shift toward self-suffuciency and primary production. Dare I say, the Empire was becoming more “crunchy”?

As I said, the analogy to the Late Roman Empire has rhetorical force. Everyone knows what the allusion is meant to indicate. **The problem emerges when people think that they can then start looking to Late Antiquity as an analogical model to make predictions about the future because of tight correspondences of conditions.** Since those correspondences actually don’t exist, rather, if there were material and moral variations across the span of the time of the Roman Empire they go in an **inverse direction from the rhetoric**, all you do is mess up your model of how the world works. Since Rod Dreher converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church he has no excuse of being ahistorical and fixated on abstract concepts of primitive salvation. The Late Roman Empire was the midwife for the greatest revolution in the history of the world from the perspective of a Catholic or Orthodox Christian,\* so perhaps he should reconsider his sloppy use of the analogy. In the short term these rhetorical tactics are useful, but in the long term truth matters and errors which propagate through the chain of reasoning can be hard to filter out.

**Note:** If you want some evidence of the decline in material affluence as a function of time, see [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20) and [Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean, 400-800](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199212961/geneexpressio-20/). A narrative of the cultural genius of the Late Roman period can be found in [The Rise of Western Christendom: Triumph and Diversity, A.D. 200-1000](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631221387/geneexpressio-20).

\* Some Protestant radicals are skeptical of the influence of Late Antiquity because they believe that the Church took a wrong turn in its institutionalization and association with temporal powers.
