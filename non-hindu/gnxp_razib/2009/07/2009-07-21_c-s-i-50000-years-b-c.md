[Shanidar 3 Neandertal rib puncture wound and paleolithic weaponry](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJS-4WSR0MV-1&_user=10&_coverDate=07/17/2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236886%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=6886&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=17&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=65069754559fd9188e656f20e100cd57):

> Since its discovery and initial description in the 1960s, the > penetrating lesion to the left ninth rib of the Shanidar 3 Neandertal > has been a focus for discussion about interpersonal violence and > weapon technology in the Middle Paleolithic. Recent experimental > studies using lithic points on animal targets suggest that aspects of > weapon system dynamics can be inferred from the form of the bony > lesions they produce. Thus, to better understand the circumstances > surrounding the traumatic injury suffered by Shanidar 3, we conducted > controlled stabbing experiments with replicas of Mousterian and > Levallois points directed against the thoraces of pig carcasses. Stabs > were conducted under both high and low kinetic energy conditions, in > an effort to replicate the usual impact forces associated with > thrusting spear vs. long-range projectile weapon systems, > respectively.  
> Analysis of the lesions produced in the pig ribs, along with > examination of goat ribs subjected primarily to high kinetic energy > stabs from an independent experiment, revealed consistent differences > in damage patterns between the two conditions. In the case of Shanidar > 3, the lack of major involvement of more than one rib, the lack of > fracturing of the affected and adjacent ribs, and the lack of bony > defects associated with the lesion (such as wastage, hinging, and > radiating fracture lines) suggests that the weapon that wounded him > was carrying relatively low kinetic energy.  
> **While accidental injury or attack with a thrusting spear or knife > cannot absolutely be ruled out, the position, angulation, and > morphology of the lesion is most consistent with injury by a low-mass, > low-kinetic energy projectile weapon. Given the potential temporal > overlap of Shanidar 3 with early modern humans in western Asia, and > the possibility that the latter were armed with projectile weapon > systems, this case carries more than simple paleoforensic interest.**

The last paragraph is elliptical, but the circumstantial evidence seems to be that this Neandertal male was injured by an anatomically modern human with weapons. No one tell [R. Brian Ferguson](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~socant/brian.htm)! In any case, [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090720163729.htm) has more more direct exposition:

> But Churchill’s analysis indicates the wound was from a thrown spear, > and it appears that modern humans had a thrown-weapons technology and > Neandertals didn’t. “We think the best explanation for this injury is > a projectile weapon, and given who had those and who didn’t that > implies at least one act of inter-species aggression.”  
> …  
> The victim was one of nine Neandertals discovered between 1953 and > 1960 in a cave in northeastern Iraq’s Zagros Mountains. Now called > “Shanidar 3,” he was a 40- to 50-year-old male with signs of arthritis > and a sharp, deep slice in his left ninth rib.  
> The wounded Neandertal’s rib had apparently started healing before he > died. Comparing the wound to medical records from the American Civil > War, a time before modern antibiotics, suggested to the researchers > that he died within weeks of the injury, perhaps due to associated > lung damage from a stabbing or piercing wound.  
> …  
> Archaeological evidence also suggests that by 50,000 years ago humans, > but not their Neandertal cousins, had developed projectile hunting > weapons, Churchill said. They used spear throwers, detachable handles > that connected with darts and spears to effectively lengthen a > hurler’s arm and give the missiles a power boost.  
> As human weapons technology advanced, Neandertals continued using long > thrusting spears in hunting, which they probably tried — for personal > safety — to keep between themselves and their prey instead of hurling > them, Churchill added.  
> …  
> Those tests revealed the delivered energy needed to create similar > wounds in the ribs of pig carcasses, which the researchers used as an > approximation of a Neandertal’s body.  
> The researchers also used measurements from a 2003 study to estimate > the impact of using a thrusted rather than thrown spear, the kind of > jabbing that Neandertals are thought to have employed. That produced > higher kinetic energies and caused more massive rib damage than > Shanidar 3 sustained.  
> Another clue was the angle of the wound. Whatever nicked his rib > entered the Neandertal’s body at about 45 degrees downward angle. > That’s consistent with the “ballistic trajectory” of a thrown weapon, > assuming that Shanidar 3 — who was about 5 feet, 6 inches tall — was > standing, Churchill said.
