Liberal distrust of the scientific consensus

Yesterday in my review of the recent Pew survey comparing attitudes of scientists and the general public I emphasized the fact that scientists are disproportionately godless liberals. But there are some issues where it seems that the Left is on the forefront of science-skepticism. There has been talk here on ScienceBlogs about the disproportionate Lefty orientation of anti-vaccination activists. From what I can tell this is true, but anti-vaccination sentiment is too shallow of a sentiment for it be starkly political, at least according to these data (there’s little party difference). On the other hand there is a big difference when it comes to animal testing, scientists have very pro-animal testing attitudes while the public is ambivalent, with Democrats split, and Republicans favoring by a 2:1 margin. There are bigger gaps here is between men and women, and the old and young, so much of the variation might be accounted for by non-political variables.  
But I want to focus on nuclear energy. The chart below lays out the gap between the public and scientists:

From the text of the Pew survey:

> About half (51%) of Americans favor building more nuclear power plants > to generate electricity, while 42% oppose this. Among the general > public, a greater percentage of men (60%) than of women (43%) favor > building additional nuclear power plants. More college graduates (59%) > favor building nuclear power plants than do those with a high school education or less (46%). And larger shares of Republicans (62%) than independents (52%) or Democrats (45%) support expanding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity.  
> When it comes to nuclear power, the views of scientists are closer to > those of Republicans than Democrats nationwide. Seven-in-ten > scientists favor building more nuclear power plants to generate > electricity, while 27% are opposed. Among scientists, majorities in > every specialty favor building more nuclear power plants, **but support is particularly widespread among physicists and astronomers (88% favor).** As with the public, far more men (76%) than women (55%) support the expansion of  
> nuclear power.

I am very struck by the high proportion of physical scientists who are in a position to understand the ins & outs of nuclear power who support the building of more plants. I suspect that the sex difference here can partly be accounted for by different disciplinary representations; physics & astronomy are far more male than the life sciences.  
In the GSS in 1993-1994 there were a few questions in regards to nuclear power. Liberals tended to be more suspicious than conservatives. Even when controlling for race and education the pattern was evident. I’ve posted [that data](http://secularright.org/wordpress/?p=2287) at *Secular Right*. I also split by sex, and though if you limit men only the difference is ameliorated it remains.
