Population genomics & the coalescent

Blogger [Thomas Mailund](http://www.mailund.dk/index.php/2009/07/07/ancestral-population-genomics-the-coalescent-hidden-markov-model-approach/) is an author on a new paper, [Ancestral Population Genomics: The Coalescent Hidden Markov Model Approach](http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/genetics.109.103010v1):

> With incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the genealogy of closely > related species differs along their genomes. The amount of ILS depends > on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population > sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of > generations between speciation events. We use a hidden Markov model > parametrized according to coalescent theory in order to infer the > genealogy along a four-species genome alignment of closely related > species, and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, > panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an > extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the > model assumptions, and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a > good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too > restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the > computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple > correction for this bias, and suggest directions for future extensions > of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence > alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral > recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic > model that allows for mutation rate heterogeneity, and reanalyze Human-Chimpanzee-Gorilla-Orangutan alignments using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution.
