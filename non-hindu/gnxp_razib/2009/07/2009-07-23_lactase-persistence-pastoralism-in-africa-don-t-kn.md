Lactase persistence, pastoralism in Africa, don't know in Europe

[Impact of Selection and Demography on the Diffusion of Lactase Persistence](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0006369#pone-0006369-t001):

The “calcium hypothesis” idea is of course one of the explanations for light skin in Northern Europe as well. The locus responsible for 1/3 of the skin color difference between Africans and Europeans, *[SLC24A5](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=slc24a5&btnG=With+Google&domains=gnxp.com&sitesearch=gnxp.com)*, is a relative recent sweep, on the order of the last 10,000 years. The authors do caution to be careful about the assumptions of their model. Point taken to heart, as I don’t think they have a good enough grasp on the fine-grained variation in the lactase persistence alleles and how they track ecology within Europe. The [Greenland Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Greenland#Norse_settlement) did not raise cattle just because of lack of Vitamin D (which they ended up getting through a shift toward a marine diet in any case), rather, there were ecological constraints in terms of the maximum productivity of grain-based subsistence farming (particularly with wheat in cold damp climates). In the conclusion of the paper it is noted that Iberia is a good test case of the model, and more data needs to be gathered there. If it is gene-culture coevolution than many Iberian peoples should be lactase persistent, but if it is due to Vitamin D, they should not be.
