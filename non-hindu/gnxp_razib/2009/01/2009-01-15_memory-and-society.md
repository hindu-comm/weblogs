Memory and society

[Recordkeeping alters economic history by promoting reciprocity](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/15/0811967106.short?rss=1):

> We experimentally demonstrate a causal link between recordkeeping and > reciprocal exchange. Recordkeeping improves memory of past > interactions in a complex exchange environment, which promotes > reputation formation and decision coordination. Economies with > recordkeeping exhibit a beneficially altered economic history where > the risks of exchanging with strangers are substantially lessened. > **Our findings are consistent with prior assertions that complex and > extensive reciprocity requires *sophisticated memory* to store > information on past transactions.** We offer insights on this research > by scientifically demonstrating that reciprocity can be facilitated by > information storage external to the brain. This is consistent with the > archaeological record, which suggests that prehistoric transaction > records and the invention of writing for recordkeeping were linked to > increased complexity in human interaction.

Itâ€™s OA, so click through and check out the charts. The effect is striking. I think this sort of result relates to my post about [The Transparent Society](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/01/transparent-society-back-to-past.php).
