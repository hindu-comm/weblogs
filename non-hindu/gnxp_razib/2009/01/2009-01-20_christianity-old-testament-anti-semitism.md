Christianity – Old Testament = Anti-Semitism?

In the comments about the term [Judeo-Christian](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=Judeo-Christian+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) the [Marcionite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism) tendencies of liberal Christianity was mentioned. Sometimes I have encountered the idea that a rejection of the Hebrew Bible within Christianity naturally results in Anti-Semitism (granted, the argument is often from neconservatives who are attempting to solidify the evangelical-neocon alliance). I decided to look into the GSS.

The question needs more investigation. My own hypothesis is this: **the desacralization of the Hebrew Bible tends to result in gentiles being far less specifically interested in some issues important to some Jews.** I’m specifically talking about Israel; I am rather sure that “Jewish influence” in many liberal Christian minds means AIPAC, not “International Bankers.” The examples of [Kaifeng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaifeng_Jews) and [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochin_Jews) should disabuse one of the nation that a belief in the Hebrew Bible is the only block against persecution of the Jews.
