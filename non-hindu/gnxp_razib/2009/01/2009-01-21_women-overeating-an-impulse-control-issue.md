Women overeating, an impulse control issue?

[Evidence of gender differences in the ability to inhibit brain activation elicited by food stimulation](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/21/0807423106.abstract):

> Although impaired inhibitory control is linked to a broad spectrum of > health problems, including obesity, the brain mechanism(s) underlying > voluntary control of hunger are not well understood. We assessed the > brain circuits involved in voluntary inhibition of hunger during food > stimulation in 23 fasted men and women using PET and > 2-deoxy-2\[18F\]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG). In men, but not in women, > food stimulation with inhibition significantly decreased activation in > amygdala, hippocampus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum, > which are regions involved in emotional regulation, conditioning, and > motivation. The suppressed activation of the orbitofrontal cortex with > inhibition in men was associated with decreases in self-reports of > hunger, which corroborates the involvement of this region in > processing the conscious awareness of the drive to eat. **This finding suggests a mechanism by which cognitive inhibition decreases the desire for food and implicates lower ability to suppress hunger in women as a contributing factor to gender differences in obesity.**

[ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090121211340.htm) has a lot more:

> “The finding of a lack of response to inhibition in women is > consistent with behavioral studies showing that women have a higher > tendency than men to overeat when presented with palatable food or > under emotional distress,” Wang said. “This decreased inhibitory > control in women could be a major factor contributing to the observed > differences in the prevalence rates of obesity and eating disorders such as binge eating between the genders, and may also underlie women’s lower success in losing weight while dieting when compared with men.”

Here’s a question: **do the sexes differ in [time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference)?**
