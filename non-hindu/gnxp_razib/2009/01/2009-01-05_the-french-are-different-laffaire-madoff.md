The French are different: L’Affaire Madoff

[Madoff Investor Awaits ‘Imbecile’ or ‘Dupe’ Verdict](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aWToFq8rw5DE&refer=home):

> Patrick Littaye, co-founder of Access International Advisors, lost his > savings after investing with Bernard Madoff, expects to lose his house in his hometown of Saint-Malo, France, and says he’ll canvass investors over the next few weeks to see whether he has also lost his business.  
> Littaye, 69, invested all of his own money with Bernard L. Madoff > Investment Securities LLC last year, enticed by the firm’s positive > returns as other hedge funds slumped. His error was compounded because > he borrowed money to increase the return on his investment, leaving him with \$4 million in personal debts, Littaye said in telephone interviews from Jan. 2 through Jan. 4. He declined to specify the amount he had lost.  
> “I’m going to sell everything I have and start over,” Littaye said from Brussels, **adding that he planned to subsist on his French social security payments.** “For Access, we’ll go to our investors over the next couple of weeks and we’ll see what they think of us.”

And some candor:

> “I don’t know yet how our correspondents will receive us,” Littaye said. **“Maybe as an honest imbecile, or an honest imbecile like 40 million others,** or someone duped by a fraud. I don’t know yet.”

His business partner, [René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René-Thierry_Magon_de_la_Villehuchet), famously committed suicided because of his shame. Meanwhile, no word from [Walter Noel](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS299US303&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=golden+in+greenwich) or [J . Ezra Merkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Ezra_Merkin), who were responsible for the loss of billions.
