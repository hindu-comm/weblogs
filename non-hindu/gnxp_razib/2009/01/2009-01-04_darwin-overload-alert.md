Darwin Overload Alert

This year is the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin, and the 150th anniversary of the Origin of Species. Predictably, there will be a large number of commemorative events and publications. I found a useful list [here](http://darwin-online.org.uk/2009.html). I suspect that by March we will all be heartily sick of CD, but I am still looking forward to the re-opening of Down House.

My immediate reason for posting is to draw attention to a series of programmes on BBC [Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/) in the coming week, including four special editions of Razib’s favourite ‘In Our Time’. I assume that these will be available worldwide online. Incidentally, while checking the Radio 4 schedules I noticed that on Tuesday there is a documentary on the singer Nico, so it is a good week for the discerning minority who are fans of Charles Darwin and the Velvets.
