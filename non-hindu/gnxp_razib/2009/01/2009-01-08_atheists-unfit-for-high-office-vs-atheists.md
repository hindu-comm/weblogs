Atheists Unfit For High Office vs. Atheists

One of the more interesting an robust survey datum in the United States is the low opinion of atheists, and, the finding that [atheists are less popular than Mormons or Muslims or Homosexuals](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/black_president_more_likely_than_mormon_or_atheist_/) when it come to a vote for high office. [Secular Right](http://secularright.org/) points out that the [Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/01/zimbabwe-is-more-accepting-of-atheists.html) has [posted](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/01/zimbabwe-is-more-accepting-of-atheists.html) data from *The World Values Survey* on this question in an international context. I doubt people will be too surprised, but, I recommend you check out the [Inductivist for the full list](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/01/zimbabwe-is-more-accepting-of-atheists.html). Below the fold I’ve taken the data on that particular question, and compared it to the % of atheists, agnostics an non-believers from selected countries (see [data source](http://www.swivel.com/graphs/show/8244121)).

I obviously log-transformed the “Atheists Unfit For High Office” responses on the Y axis. I posted the trendline so that you can see if there is a pattern for the nations above and below it. You can download the data as a csv if you wish to flesh it out by adding better % of atheists, etc., survey data.
