Australian Aboriginal morbidity & mortality

A few years ago *PLoS Medicine* published [Eight Americas: Investigating Mortality Disparities across Races, Counties, and Race-Counties in the United States](http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030260). The results were:  
— Asian-Americans, per capita income of \$21,566, life expectancy of 84.9 years.  
— Northland low-income rural Whites, \$17,758, 79 years.  
— Middle America (mostly White), \$24,640, 77.9 years.  
— Low-income Whites in Appalachia, Mississippi Valley, \$16,390, 75 years.  
— Western American Indians, \$10,029, 72.7 years.  
— Black Middle America, \$15,412, 72.9 years.  
— Southern low-income rural Blacks, \$10,463, 71.2 years.  
— High-risk urban Blacks, \$14,800, 71.1 years.  
That’s a 13.8 year difference between inner city blacks and Asian Americans.  
Now, from [The health and welfare of Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 2003](http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/9226):

> …Indigenous life expectancy at birth is 20 years less than for the > total  
> population, 56 years for Indigenous males compared to 77 years for > all  
> Australian males and 63 years for Indigenous females compared to  
> 82 years for all Australian females for the period 1999-2001….

Read the whole report for the greatly increased rates of alcoholism and other morbidity and mortality enhancing behaviors among indigenous Australians, but check out this breakdown of various increased risks for diseases (adapted from Wikipedia, but the source is the report linked above):

I want to emphasize the increased rates of communicable diseases. Some of these, such as the venereal diseases, have behavior-based causes. On the other hand, the susceptibility to tuberculosis is probably in part a function of the fact that Australian Aboriginals have had less exposure to a variety of Eurasian diseases in their [evolutionary history](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465002218/geneexpressio-20/).
