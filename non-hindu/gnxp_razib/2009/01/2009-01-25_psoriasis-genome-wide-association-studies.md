Psoriasis genome-wide association studies

[](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/images/ng.311-F1.jpg)  
The latest disease to be put under the scrutiny of a large genome-wide association study is psoriasis–see articles [here](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.311.html), [here](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.310.html), and [here](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.313.html). These are mostly standard studies, but [once again](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/09/feeling-sleepy.php) I’m struck by the effect of the MHC (HLA) region (see the figure). It was well-known, of course, that variation in HLA affects all manner of immunity-related phenotypes, but what’s becoming clear is that this variation has much larger effects than other loci in the genome. I find this somewhat surprising–associations with MHC variability were identified because typing HLA was feasible many years ago; well before genome-wide association mapping with SNPs was even considered. This could be a case where, in the analogy to the man searching for the lost keys in the dark, looking under the lamppost was actually the best bet.
