To the big men go the women!

[Market forces affect patterns of polygyny in Uganda](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/01/21/0810016106.short?rss=1):

> Polygynous marriage is generally more beneficial for men than it is > for women, although women may choose to marry an already-married man > if he is the best alternative available. We use the theory of > biological markets to predict that the likelihood of a man marrying > polygynously will be a function of the level of resources that he has, > the local sex ratio, and the resources that other men in the local > population have. Using records of more than 1 million men in 56 > districts from the 2002 Ugandan census, we show that polygynously > married men are more likely to own land than monogamously married men, > that polygynous marriages become more common as the district sex ratio > becomes more female biased, **that owning land is particularly > important when men are abundant in the district, and that a man’s owning land most increases the odds of polygyny in districts where few other men own land.** Results are discussed with reference to models of the evolution of polygyny.

My piece for *The Guardian*, [Monogamy: bucking the trend?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/20/animalbehaviour-evolution), was fundamentally an argument against natural short term market forces.
