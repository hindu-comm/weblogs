Ethnic differences in morality

Everyone & their mother is emailing me about Jonathan Haidt’s new commentary in *Edge*, [FASTER EVOLUTION MEANS MORE ETHNIC DIFFERENCES](http://www.edge.org/q2009/q09_4.html#haidt):

> I believe that the “Bell Curve” wars of the 1990s, over race > differences in intelligence, will seem genteel and short-lived > compared to the coming arguments over ethnic differences in moralized > traits. I predict that this “war” will break out between 2012 and > 2017. >

Yes, [psychopathy](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/12/though_barbara_oakleys_evil_ge.php) might have adaptive “strengths” in a [frequency dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-dependent_selection) context, but I don’t think that’s what Haidt meant! One difference with the IQ wars when it comes to personality is that it seems every single [dopamine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor) has already been [implicated in behavior genetic variation](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/1/10.full), while we’re still a long way from IQ loci results which have been reproduced, though one might double-check on the [details of the statistical analyses](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/questioning-breastfeeding-iq-fads2.php) on suggestive findings from behavior genetics. In any case, since [the heritability of behavior in economic games](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/heritability-of-ultimatum-game.php) has already been established, it would be interesting if [GWAs](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/07/linkage-versus-association-mini-primer.php) found some loci which tracked the variation. My own hunch is that personality variation is less continuous than IQ (characterized by a few morphs hanging around fitness peaks), with an underlying architecture of larger effect QTLs. Perhaps altruism is just way simpler to modulate than general intelligence?
