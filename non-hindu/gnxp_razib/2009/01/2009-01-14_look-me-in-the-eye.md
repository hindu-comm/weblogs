Look me in the eye!

[Serotonin Transporter Genotype Modulates Social Reward and Punishment in Rhesus Macaques](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004156) (paper is OA, so click through for stats & charts):

> Serotonin signaling influences social behavior in both human and > nonhuman primates. In humans, variation upstream of the promoter > region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has recently been > shown to influence both behavioral measures of social anxiety and > amygdala response to social threats. Here we show that length polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR predict social reward and punishment in rhesus macaques, a species in which 5-HTTLPR variation is analogous to that of humans. >
> In contrast to monkeys with two copies of the long allele (L/L), > monkeys with one copy of the short allele of this gene (S/L) spent > less time gazing at face than non-face images, less time looking in > the eye region of faces, and had larger pupil diameters when gazing at > photos of a high versus low status male macaques. Moreover, in a novel > primed gambling task, presentation of photos of high status male > macaques promoted risk-aversion in S/L monkeys but promoted risk-seeking in L/L monkeys. Finally, as measured by a “pay-per-view” task, S/L monkeys required juice payment to view photos of high status males, whereas L/L monkeys sacrificed fluid to see the same photos.

*ScienceDaily* has an [interesting tidbit](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090113201339.htm):

> In a series of experiments, the S version of the gene in monkeys was found to influence their risk-taking when faced with particular social stimuli. >
> “Based on work in humans, we interpreted this to reflect an induction of a fearful emotional state, which often leads people to become risk averse,” said Karli Watson, Ph.D., of the Duke Department of Neurobiology, lead author on the paper. >
> **In human populations of European ancestry, 48% are S/L and 36% are L/L. The rest are S/S. The S allele is more common in Asian populations, Watson noted.**
