England 2007/2008 GCSE Results by Race/Ethnicity

The [Department of Children, Schools and Families](http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/) in Great Britain has released its [report](http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000822/index.shtml) for 2007/2008 breaking down nationwide educational attainment by pupil characteristics, including race. Actually, the report was released in November, but I was holding off on posting about it because I was under the erroneous impression that updated, race-specific data would be provided in mid-January.

DavidB has posted on previous reports for [2002](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001032.html), [2003/2004](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/003749.html), [2005](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/03/education-and-ethnic-groups-in-britain.php), and [2006/2007](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/education-and-ethnic-groups-in-britain.php). Some readers might be interested in my summary of the 2007/2008 GCSE results for racial and ethnic groups in England, which Iâ€™ve posted [here.](https://congenialtimes.blogspot.com/2009/01/race-and-educational-achievement-in.html)
