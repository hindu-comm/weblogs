Koreans are like the Hmong

Over at my [other weblog](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/01/korean_genetic_relationships.php) I
[review](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/01/korean_genetic_relationships.php) a paper [on the genetics](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004210) of Koreans. The title is a shout-out to an old Korean American friend of mine who received a great deal of grief from his female Korean American peers for openly admitting that he was into a Hmong girl. She was very good-looking, but as they said, “*But* she’s Hmong….”
