Topology to teleos?

Over at *Culture11*, Will Wilson (a mathematics student at Yale) has an interesting article up, [Screaming Shapes & Seven-Dimensional Donuts](http://culture11.com/print/36338):

> It is clear that reductionist and demiurgic approaches to science have > stood unchallenged on the intellectual landscape for too long, and > their profound philosophical and cultural implications left to unfold > freely. Many will complain that explanation and understanding — which > shift the purpose of inquiry away from mere accuracy and toward > knowledge of propriety — is not the role of science. This may be true > in the aftermath of the divorce of science from philosophy won by the > positivists, but perhaps it is time that this split be healed in a way > that allows us to gain in both humility and wholeness. Thom’s theory > alone may be unsatisfactory, but it points the way towards what is > needed: a rigorous unification of prediction and explanation that is > aware of its political and cultural implications; a postmodern natural > philosophy for the masses.

That’s the conclusion. You have to read the whole thing to understand what Will is getting at. I am myself a “Three cheers for reductionism!” fellow, but I’m curious if any mathematicians might weigh in (I’m not familiar with René Thom’s work, which is the launching point for Wilson’s essay).
