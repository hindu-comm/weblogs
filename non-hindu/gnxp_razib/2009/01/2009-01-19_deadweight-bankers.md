Deadweight bankers

[The End of Banking as We Know It](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/business/18gret.html?hp=&pagewanted=print):

> The bright side is that all those displaced financial services professionals can now set their sights on doing something, **well, truly useful.**  
> Still, this adjustment will be painful for all those who have to carve out new careers, as well as for New York and other places these companies call home.  
> Finally, what will a humbled financial services industry mean for consumers? **Higher borrowing costs**, Mr. Miller said.  
> “The leverage that these companies were using allowed them to lower their rates,” he said. “Rates have to go higher for the banks to operate in a safe and sound manner and make money.”  
> Credit is also likely to remain tight, in Mr. Miller’s opinion. **A result is that consumer spending won’t recover to bubble levels.**

The bloated banking sector did have a use: propping up conspicuous consumption in a culture where for a small moment everyone fancied themselves a potential real estate millionaire in the making. It seems the current opinion is that all those extra iBankers were like all the extra bureaucrats at any large corporation; no value added except for their own bottom line. To be fair, I think this argument could be made about most scientists and science. But there is a structural difference between science & finance. Just because 99.99% of scientific possibilities are false leads, it doesn’t mean that it is then acceptable that 99.99% of financial decisions are also missteps. In finance the remaining 0.01% of decisions won’t result in something like electricity or the railroad.
