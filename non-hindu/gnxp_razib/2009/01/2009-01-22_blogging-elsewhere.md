Blogging elsewhere….

At ScienceBlogs, [I posted](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/01/how_ashkenazi_jewish_are_you.php) on a [new paper](http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/1/R7) on Jewish genetics. At Taki’s Magazine I offer my opinion as to why [labor and capital](http://www.takimag.com/blogs/article/human_input_vs._human_inputs/) flows are qualitatively different, as well as [some](http://www.takimag.com/sniperstower/article/the_fall_of_rome/) [pedantic](http://www.takimag.com/sniperstower/article/genetics_history/) comments on points of Roman history. I wouldn’t be such a stickler on Roman history…but people just love to [make analogies](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/01/analogies-seconded.php) based on presumed correspondences. I’ve been meaning to review Peter Turchin’s new book, [Secular Cycles](http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/turchin/PDF/All_SEC.pdf), which you can read for free as a [PDF](http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/turchin/PDF/All_SEC.pdf). But if you recall how long [my last post](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/08/historical-dynamics-and-contingent.php) on his [previous book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691116695/geneexpressio-20) was, it might be a little while in coming, so I encourage everyone to read [Secular Cycles](http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/turchin/PDF/All_SEC.pdf) if the topic interests them. Finally, Ed Yong [has a nice review](http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/01/bacteria_and_languages_reveal_how_people_spread_through_the.php) of a new paper *Language Phylogenies Reveal Expansion Pulses and Pauses in Pacific Settlement* (the paper is in *Science*, but it doesn’t seem online yet).
