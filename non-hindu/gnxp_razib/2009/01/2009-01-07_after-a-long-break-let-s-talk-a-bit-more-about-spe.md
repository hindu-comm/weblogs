After a long break… let's talk a bit more about speciation!

…well. I took a bit longer than I had intended in getting to work on this next post, but it’s okay. When I left you hanging a few weeks ago, I mentioned that the idea of reinforcement (that is, selection for increased pre-mating isolation in the presence of post-mating isolation) was out of favor for a while, but it was brought back in a big way by a certain paper. I’ll spend some time talking about that paper here.

So, of course, the paper I’m talking about is [Coyne and Orr 1989](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/cluster/pdf/coyne/Coyne&Orr_1989.pdf) (open access). Maybe it’s just because of the way I was taught speciation, but this paper arguably opened the flood gates for a lot of modern research on speciation. First of all, Coyne and Orr came up with a useful way to quantify reproductive isolation. This allowed them to undertake one of the first meta-analyses of speciation ever, and they came up with some rather interesting data. The most important stuff is in figure 5:

Figure 5 shows that among both “allopatric” and “sympatric” taxa, pre-zygotic isolation increases with time, but among sympatic taxa, it increases faster! This is in contrast to the rates of increase of post-zygotic isolation, which are the same between allopatric and sympatric taxa. This definitely argues in favor of a reinforcement hypothesis.

Anyway, there are many other important points to this paper, primarily that there is a correlation between genetic distance and reproductive isolation. This is precisely what we expect under the current model of speciation, which I will hopefully talk about in the future.

As an administrative note, I figured initially that I would do a series of posts, which would build on top of each other, but I’ll probably put that off. I’ll just be blogging about things I find that are interesting, which can come a lot quicker! Hopefully you’ll see more of me in the near future.
