WordPress vs. Expression Engine vs. Django

One of my friends has built a Django site for a corp and wants to have a blog to accompany it. The blog will be pretty full featured with a lot of posts per day. His question: **will he be better off using WordPress + plugins, buying Expression Engine, or rolling his own in Django using some of the stub apps out there?**
