Juju investing advice

From [Toward Rational Exuberance: The Evolution of the Modern Stock Market](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374528500/geneexpressio-20):

> What must have been most galling was a simple point Cowels often made > that was never answered effectively by the investment advice > practioners. As Cowels put it, “Market advice for a fee is a paradox. Anyone who really knew just wouldn’t share his knowledge. Why should he? In five years, he could be the richest man in the world. Why pass the word on?” >
> In spite of the conclusions he reached, Cowels never doubted that > investors would keep buying newsletters. As he put it, “Even if I did > my negative surveys every five years, or others continued them when I’m gone, it wouldn’t matter. People are still going to subscribe to these services. **They want to believe that somebody really knows. A world in which nobody really knows can be frightening.**“

The quote is from [Alfred Cowles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Cowles), the early patron of econometrics. It’s kind of like [The Bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(TV_series)), people know it’s not really going to work out, but they keep watching just in case there’s a repeat of [Trista & Ryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trista_Rehn). This book was written in 2001, but a great deal of it will be of interest to those of us who live in 2009 (see [this review](https://www.amazon.com/review/R10CXQU0YN6C6J/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)).
