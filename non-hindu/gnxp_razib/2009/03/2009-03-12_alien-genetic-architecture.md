Alien genetic architecture

![general.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/general.png?resize=200%2C301)![general.png](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/general.png?resize=200%2C301)[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/03/blue-eyed-lemurs-not-herc2.php) has a [post up](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/03/blue-eyed-lemurs-not-herc2.php) which he illustrates with a photograph of a rather ghoulish prosimian. I’ve read that some of the Victorians found chimpanzees & gorillas almost obscene because of their simultaneous resemblance to humanity and manifest inhumanity. I somewhat feel the same about prosimians, especially [tarsiers](https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS315US315&q=tarsier&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi). No doubt this is due to my relative familiarity with immature chimpanzees on television shows. In any case, there is a [new paper out](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122249181/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0) which demonstrates that the genetic architecture of blue eyes in two species of lemurs is not similar to that in [humans](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=herc2+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search). Contrast this to the case for [horse](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/11/white-horses-and-blonde-humans-genetic.php) and [zebrafish](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/12/race-is-skin-deep.php).  
A simple story could go that the specific character of a species’ [genetic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_architecture), the structure of relationships of genetic variation which contribute to the nature of a given trait, is purely a function of historical accidents, or, that there are widespread convergences across taxa. At least for pigmentation it looks to be a mix, which restrains us I suppose from making glib generalizations and inferences as to likelihoods. In the comments I wondered about Siamese cats, and the first author on the paper was kind enough to leave a comment:

> Blue eyes in Siamese cats is likely due to a tyrosinase mutation: > http://www3.interscience.wiley.c…652329/ abstract  
> \[Well, that’s proximate, Satan undoubtedly ultimate\]  
> We did sequence this same HERC2 region for a few Burmese cats and > Siberian huskies – they have the same conserved mammalian sequence.
