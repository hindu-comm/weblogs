Expertise & entertainment

Jonah Lehrer, author of [How We Decide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618620117/geneexpressio-20/), has a [post up](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/03/phony_experts.php) where he notes how bad political “experts” are. Nevertheless, I’m a little confused, **isn’t the whole point of political pundits & stock pickers to be *entertaining*, as opposed to expert?** It seems that the premise that the public is rationally consuming expertise is just false.
