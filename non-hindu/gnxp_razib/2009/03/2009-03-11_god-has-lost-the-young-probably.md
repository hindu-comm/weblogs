God has lost the young-probably

One of the issues that often comes up when I [report data](http://secularright.org/wordpress/?p=1718) which show that the young are more secular (or [liberal](http://www.takimag.com/sniperstower/article/conservatism_ideology_of_the_old/)) than the old is that people change with time. And age is presumed to correlate with greater religiosity and conservatism. I’ll take politics off the table. [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/03/people-do-not-age-out-of-their.html) suggests that the GSS doesn’t indicate that the young become anymore religious with age. In other words, religiosity at age X is a very good predictor of religiosity at age X + n.  
Christian Fundamentalist pollster George Barna observes the same in his [surveys](http://barna.org/barna-update/article/21-transformation/252-barna-survey-examines-changes-in-worldview-among-christians-over-the-past-13-years):

> The research data showed that one pattern emerged loud and clear: > young adults rarely possess a biblical worldview. The current study found that less than one-half of one percent of adults in the Mosaic generation – i.e., those aged 18 to 23 – have a biblical worldview, compared to about one out of every nine older adults.

Earlier Barna [reported](http://barna.org/barna-update/article/12-faithspirituality/102-atheists-and-agnostics-take-aim-at-christians):

> One of the most fascinating insights from the research is the > increasing size of the no-faith segment with each successive > generation. The proportion of atheists and agnostics increases from 6% > of Elders (ages 61+) and 9% of Boomers (ages 42-60), to 14% of Busters > (23-41) and 19% of adult Mosaics (18-22). **When adjusted for age and > compared to 15 years ago, each generation has changed surprisingly > little over the past decade and a half.** Each new generation entered > adulthood with a certain degree of secular fervor, which appears to stay relatively constant within that generation over time. This contradicts the popular notion that such generational differences are simply a product of people becoming more faith-oriented as they age.

Conservative Christians do have more children than the young, but the atheist childless seem awful good at seducing the souls of the innocent.
