Brain & intelligence

Readers of this weblog from back in 2002 know that we used to point to Paul Thompson’s research. So see this, [Genetics of Brain Fiber Architecture and Intellectual Performance](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/7/2212):

> The study is the first to analyze genetic and environmental factors > that affect brain fiber architecture and its genetic linkage with > cognitive function. We assessed white matter integrity voxelwise using > diffusion tensor imaging at high magnetic field (4 Tesla), in 92 > identical and fraternal twins. White matter integrity, quantified > using fractional anisotropy (FA), was used to fit structural equation > models (SEM) at each point in the brain, generating three-dimensional > maps of heritability. We visualized the anatomical profile of > correlations between white matter integrity and full-scale, verbal, > and performance intelligence quotients (FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ). White > matter integrity (FA) was under strong genetic control and was highly > heritable in bilateral frontal….bilateral parietal…and left > occipital…lobes, and was correlated with FIQ and PIQ in the cingulum, > optic radiations, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, internal > capsule, callosal isthmus, and the corona radiata…for PIQ, corrected > for multiple comparisons). In a cross-trait mapping approach, common > genetic factors mediated the correlation between IQ and white matter > integrity, suggesting a common physiological mechanism for both, and > common genetic determination. These genetic brain maps reveal > heritable aspects of white matter integrity and should expedite the > discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting fiber > connectivity and cognition.
