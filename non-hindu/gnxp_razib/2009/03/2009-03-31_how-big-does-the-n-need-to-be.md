How big does the N need to be?

[Estimating the number of unseen variants in the human genome](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5008.short?rss=1):

> …Consistent with previous descriptions, our results show that the > African population is the most diverse in terms of the number of > variants expected to exist, the Asian populations the least diverse, > with the European population in-between. In addition, our results show > a clear distinction between the Chinese and the Japanese populations, > with the Japanese population being the less diverse. To find all > common variants (frequency at least 1%) the number of individuals that > need to be sequenced is small (∼350) and does not differ much among > the different populations; our data show that, subject to sequence > accuracy, the 1000 Genomes Project is likely to find most of these > common variants and a high proportion of the rarer ones (frequency > between 0.1 and 1%). **The data reveal a rule of diminishing returns: > a small number of individuals (∼150) is sufficient to identify 80% of > variants with a frequency of at least 0.1%, while a much larger number > (\> 3,000 individuals) is necessary to find all of those variants.** Finally, our results also show a much higher diversity in environmental response genes compared with the average genome, especially in African populations.
