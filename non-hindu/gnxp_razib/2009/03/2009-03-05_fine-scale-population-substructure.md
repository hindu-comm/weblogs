Fine scale population substructure

[Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/03/genetic-differentiation-at-village.html) comments on the paper which showed genetic substructure among a set of Sardinian villages:

> The take-home lesson is that wherever gene flow is impeded, no matter > how geographically close, population differentiation can be recovered > with dense autosomal genotype data.

The potential exploration of population structure mapping onto non-geographic variables is definitely going to be interesting.
