Paternity rates by population

A few years ago a paper came out, [How Well Does Paternity Confidence Match Actual Paternity?](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/504167):

> Evolutionary theory predicts that males will provide less parental > investment for putative offspring who are unlikely to be their actual > offspring. Cross‐culturally, paternity confidence (a man’s assessment > of the likelihood that he is the father of a putative child) is > positively associated with men’s involvement with children and with > investment or inheritance from paternal kin. A survey of 67 studies > reporting nonpaternity suggests that for men with high paternity > confidence rates of nonpaternity are(excluding studies of unknown > methodology) typically 1.9%, substantially less than the typical rates > of 10% or higher cited by many researchers. Further cross‐cultural > investigation of the relationship between paternity and paternity > confidence is warranted.

I’ve referred to this paper before, but I thought it might be useful to post the rates for various populations. See the original paper for sources & discussion.  
Note that the second set of results from paternity testing laboratories obviously are subject to selection bias.
