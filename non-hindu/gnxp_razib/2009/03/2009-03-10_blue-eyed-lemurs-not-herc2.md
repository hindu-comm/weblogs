Blue-eyed lemurs: not HERC2

[](http://lemur.duke.edu/animals/blueeyed/general.jpg)The genetics of blue eye color in humans is [almost entirely controlled](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2008/01/herc2-blue-eye-color-danes.php) by a single SNP in a conserved non-coding region in an intron of HERC2, as was strikingly demonstrated in [a recent study](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/03/predicting_eye_colour_in_embry.php) on using genetics to predict eye pigmentation.

Humans are not the only primate to have blue eyes–one notable example is the blue-eyed black lemur (pictured on the right). As it’s well-known that convergent evolution in pigmentation has occurred in many taxa via similar genetic mechanisms (eg. MC1R), one obvious question is: have similar genetic changes led to blue eyes in humans and other primates? For blue-eyed lemurs, a [new study demonstrates](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122249181/abstract) that, well, the answer is no. The authors sequence the region known to be causal for human blue eyes in both blue-eyed black lemurs and a closely-related, non-blue-eyed species, and find no differences.

Though this is a negative result, it’s still kind of fun, and establishes a nice example of convergent evolution via separate genetic mechanisms in primates.
