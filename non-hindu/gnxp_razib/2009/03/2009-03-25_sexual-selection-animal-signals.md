Sexual selection & animal signals

Nick Wade in *The New York Times* has a [piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/science/24armo.html?src=sch&pagewanted=print) on a [review](http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173502?prevSearch=(emlen)+AND+%5Bjournal:+ecolsys%5D&searchHistoryKey=) on the relationships between male competition, signaling and sexual selection. If the topic interests you I strongly recommend [Animal Signals](https://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/002006.html), John Maynard Smithâ€™s last book.
