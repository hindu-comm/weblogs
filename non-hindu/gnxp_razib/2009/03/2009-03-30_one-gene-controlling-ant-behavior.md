One gene controlling ant behavior?

[Single Gene Shapes the Toil of Ants’ Fighter and Forager Castes](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/science/31ants.html?ref=science&pagewanted=print):

> Researchers studying the social behavior of ants have found that a > single gene underlies both the aggressive behavior of the ant colony’s > soldiers and the food gathering behavior of its foraging caste.  
> The gene is active in soldier ants, particularly in five neurons in > the front of their brain, where it generates large amounts of its > product, a protein known as PKG. The exact amount of the protein in > the ants’ brains is critical to their behavior.

The article goes on talk to about correlates of PKG variation in humans….
