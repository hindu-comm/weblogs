Copy Number Variation in African Americans

The paper is pretty straightforward, [Copy number variation in African Americans](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/15/abstract):

> Employing a SNP platform with greater than 500,000 SNPs, a > first-generation CNV map of the African American genome was generated > using DNA from 385 healthy African American individuals, and compared > to a sample of 435 healthy White individuals. A total of 1362 CNVs > were identified within African Americans, which included **two CNV > regions that were significantly different in frequency between African Americans and Whites (17q21 and 15q11).** In addition, a duplication was identified in 74% of DNAs derived from cell lines that was not present in any of the whole blood derived DNAs.

Also see [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090323211921.htm). The authors are interested for purposes of disease, one of the loci which exhibit a CNV difference seem to be related to a variant of mental retardation. They suggest that differences between whites and blacks on this locus might be due to difference in the frequency of duplication between the two groups (45% vs. 8% respectively). Though remember that we have a non-pathological example of CNV polymorphism in human populations. As the field gets saturated by analyses of [SNPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_nucleotide_polymorphism) one assumes that there will be more investigation of other types of genetic variation, such as CNVs.
