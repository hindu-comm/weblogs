Genomics confirms that inbred populations are inbred

If you read an older work like [The History and Geography of Human Genes](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691029059/geneexpressio-20) based on classical genetic markers Sardinia stands out on charts of genetic distance. This is probably due to the fact that Sardinia is an island and gene flow from surrounding regions is relatively limited due to the physical barriers. So the first settlers have an outsized genetic impact which is not diluted over time by intermarriage with surrounding populations. Additionally, because an island can be treated as an isolate, that reduces effective population and increases the power of random genetic drift, which will likely result in a sharper deviation from the original genetic state at settlement. See the case of Iceland.  
With that in mind, there is a new paper out, [High Differentiation among Eight Villages in a Secluded Area of Sardinia Revealed by Genome-Wide High Density SNPs Analysis](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004654):

Basically a [genetic map writ small](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=genetic+map+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search). Here’s some charts which illustrate the dynamics:

No surprise that people from relatively inbred villages are more closely related to each other than they are to others in other relatively inbred villages. My own hope is that these quantitative illustrations and measures of genetic distance and relationships can be used to **paint a more precise picture of demographic change and dynamics over time.** Consider for example the fact that “Puritan Stock” Americans are descended primarily from a wave of migrants on the order of 30,000 individuals in the 1630s. 30,000 is a large enough *N* that there might no bottleneck, but I’m wondering if at some point we might have sample sizes large enough where **different streams of WASPs can be easily separated.** The four folkways in [Albion’s Seed](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195069056//geneexpressio-20).
