Will the recession bring anti-globalization protests back?

When I was a clueless sophomore and junior in college, 2000 – 2001, the cool thing that was sweeping through campuses was anti-globalization. It was more than just that, but this was the core. (There was also the Nader campaign, the Florida vote fiasco, Enron, and 9/11.) At the time I was incredibly far left (left anarchist) but drifted away from the movement around the spring of 2003, the last big protest being against the invasion of Iraq. I didn’t have anything to do with it after that, and my views have moved to the center-right.

As this [list of anti-globalization protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anti-globalization_demonstrations) confirms, I wasn’t unusual. The really large protests took place in 2000 and especially 2001, they were on the decline by 2003, and from 2004 through 2006, they were non-existent within the First World (aside from ritualistic May Day protests). There’s a slight uptick in 2007, and now The Telegraph reports that [London is preparing for the biggest protest in a decade](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/4986303/Biggest-police-operation-for-a-decade-to-be-launched-at-G20-summit-in-London.html). The umbrella group organizing the protest is [G20 Meltdown](http://www.g-20meltdown.org/).

Maybe it’s not surprising, but it looks like these things flare up during recessions and abate during booms. The first round took place during the dot-com crash, and by 2004, college students and 20-somethings were too busy applying their dopey open minds to the topics of metrosexual facial moisturizers, which regional real estate bubble they would exuberantly contribute to, and the crunk and post-punk revival music that was out — way cooler than that Blink182 bullshit that was popular from about 1997 to 2002. But now that young people sense bad things ahead, we may be in for another deluge of protesting professors, fliers for International Socialist Organization meetings, and low-status young males lobbing rocks to impress the one cute anarchist chick at the protest.
