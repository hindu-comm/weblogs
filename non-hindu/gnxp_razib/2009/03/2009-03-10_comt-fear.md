COMT & Fear

[Genetic Gating of Human Fear Learning and Extinction: Possible Implications for Gene-Environment Interaction in Anxiety Disorder](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121659835/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0):

> Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely used model of the acquisition > and extinction of fear. Neural findings suggest that the amygdala is > the core structure for fear acquisition, whereas prefrontal cortical > areas are given pivotal roles in fear extinction. Forty-eight > volunteers participated in a fear-conditioning experiment, which used > fear potentiation of the startle reflex as the primary measure to > investigate the effect of two genetic polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR and > COMTval158met) on conditioning and extinction of fear. The 5-HTTLPR > polymorphism, located in the serotonin transporter gene, is associated > with amygdala reactivity and neuroticism, whereas the COMTval158met > polymorphism, which is located in the gene coding for > catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a dopamine-degrading enzyme, > affects prefrontal executive functions. Our results show that only > carriers of the 5-HTTLPR s allele exhibited conditioned startle > potentiation, whereas carriers of the COMT met/met genotype failed to extinguish conditioned fear. These results may have interesting implications for understanding gene-environment interactions in the development and treatment of anxiety disorders.

Hereâ€™s the COMT [SNP](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php?title=Rs4680) in [SNPedia](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php?title=Rs4680). Also, here it is in the [HGDP browser](http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/alfreqs.cgi?pos=18331271&chr=chr22&rs=rs4680&imp=false). A/A is low activity variant.
