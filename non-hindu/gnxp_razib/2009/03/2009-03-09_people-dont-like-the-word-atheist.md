People don't like the word atheist

The [American Religious Identification Survey 2008](http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/) is out. It is complementary to the Pew [Religious Landscape Survey](https://religions.pewforum.org/), and seems to confirm its findings. But its main advantage is that there was a survey in 1990 and 2001, so you have three points in time from which to observe trends.

As you can see, the number of atheists & agnostics tracks the general increase in the number with no religion, it’s doubled in the past generation. But, though only 2% of the population identifies as atheist & agnostic, around \~10% of the population holds to beliefs which are atheistic or agnostic.  
Interestingly the shift toward “No Religion” is about the same in all ethnic groups:
