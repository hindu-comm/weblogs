Earliest domestication of horse?

Via [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/03/earliest-horse-domestication-in.html), [The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5919/1332):

> Horse domestication revolutionized transport, communications, and > warfare in prehistory, yet the identification of early domestication > processes has been problematic. Here, we present three independent > lines of evidence demonstrating domestication in the Eneolithic Botai > Culture of Kazakhstan, **dating to about 3500 B.C.E. Metrical analysis > of horse metacarpals shows that Botai horses resemble Bronze Age > domestic horses** rather than Paleolithic wild horses from the same > region. Pathological characteristics indicate that some Botai horses > were bridled, perhaps ridden. Organic residue analysis, using 13C and D values of fatty acids, **reveals processing of mareâ€™s milk and carcass products in ceramics**, indicating a developed domestic economy encompassing secondary products.
