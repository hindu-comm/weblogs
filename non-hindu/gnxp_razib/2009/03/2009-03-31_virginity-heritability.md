Virginity & heritability

[Genes may time loss of virginity](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16876-genes-may-time-loss-of-virginity.html):

> As genetic determinism goes, the new findings are modest. Segal’s team > found that genes **explain a third of the differences in participants’ age at first intercourse – which was, on average, a little over 19 years old.** By comparison, roughly 80% of variations in height across a population can be explained by genes alone.  
> …  
> On the other hand, conservative social mores might delay a teen’s > first sexual experience, causing scientists to low-ball the effect of genes. **Indeed, Segal’s team noticed a less pronounced genetic effect among twins born before 1948, compared with those who came of age in the 1960s or later.**  
> …  
> As for the specific genes involved, another team previously found that > a version of a gene encoding a receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine is associated with age at first intercourse. **Others have linked the same version of the gene – called DRD4 – to impulsive, risk-taking behaviour.**

The paper is [Age at first intercourse in twins reared apart: Genetic influence and life history events](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V9F-4VX0BD5-1&_user=4200739&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000000593&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4200739&md5=ba610d235877e1f3a6161e05b4cb59c7).

[FuturePundit](http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/006088.html) notes:

> The team found a weaker effect from genes with people born before > 1948. This supports an argument I’ve made here previously: the breakdown of old cultural constraints on behavior frees up people to follow genetically driven desires and impulses. **We become more genetically driven as external constraints weaken.**

When you remove the strength of environmental parameters from the equation it naturally results in a greater salience of heritable ones. Ergo, the logic whereby you can make the case that in a perfect meritocracy there will be [much stronger genetic sorting by class](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/06/whey_genetic_determinism_is_in.php) (via assortative mating, etc.).
