GNXP readers do not breed

No surprise. But the data are rather stark. Excluding those who gave “No Answer” and “Lots” here are the mean number of children of readers by age group from the survey, with the mean number of children in the age groups from the GSS for whites in the parentheses:

18-25 = 0 (0.32)  
26-35 = 0.25 (1.36)  
36-45 = 0.93 (2.17)  
46-65 = 1.02 (2.63)  
65+ = 1.88 (2.65)

I thought I would post this since [The Inductivist](https://inductivist.blogspot.com/2009/03/mr.html) is giving Greg props for his large family. I did exclude the one individual who said they had “lots” of children in the 18-25 age group. I wish Bryan Caplan the best of luck in [evangelizing for reproduction](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/having_more_kid.html), but it’s going to be a tough sell.

The raw numbers are below in a table.
