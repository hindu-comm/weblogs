IQ & neuroscience

[Positive association between cognitive ability and cortical thickness in a representative US sample of healthy 6 to 18 year-olds](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W4M-4TY8W8W-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9e7a0d8700d06809fe50588800b02c16):

> Neuroimaging studies, using various modalities, have evidenced a link > between the general intelligence factor (g) and regional brain > function and structure in several multimodal association areas. While > in the last few years, developments in computational neuroanatomy have > made possible the in vivo quantification of cortical thickness, the > relationship between cortical thickness and psychometric intelligence > has been little studied. Recently, cortical thickness estimations have > been improved by the use of an iterative hemisphere-specific template > registration algorithm which provides a better between-subject > alignment of brain surfaces. Using this improvement, we aimed to > further characterize brain regions where cortical thickness was > associated with cognitive ability differences and to test the > hypothesis that these regions are mostly located in multimodal > association areas. We report associations between a general cognitive > ability factor (as an estimate of g) derived from the four subtests of > the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and cortical thickness > adjusted for age, gender, and scanner in a large sample of healthy > children and adolescents (ages 6â€“18, n = 216) representative of the > US population. Significant positive associations were evidenced between the cognitive ability factor and cortical thickness in most multimodal association areas. Results are consistent with a distributed model of intelligence.
