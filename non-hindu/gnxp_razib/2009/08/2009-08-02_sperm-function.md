Sperm Function

This research [report](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-secret-life-of-sperm-is-unlocked-1766251.html) suggests that some genes in human sperms can be ‘read’ by the cytoplasm of the egg immediately after fertilisation. Some interesting implications for hybridism, infertility, and other issues.
