New "language gene"?

[Anthropology.net](http://anthropology.net/2009/08/29/kiaa0319-a-new-candidate-gene-for-language/) points me to a new paper, [Convergent genetic linkage and associations to language, speech and reading measures in families of probands with Specific Language Impairment](http://www.springerlink.com/content/6808305j34217466/):

> We analyzed genetic linkage and association of measures of language, > speech and reading phenotypes to candidate regions in a single set of > families ascertained for SLI. Sib-pair and family-based analyses were > carried out for candidate gene loci for Reading Disability (RD) on > chromosomes 1p36, 3p12-q13, 6p22, and 15q21, and the speech-language > candidate region on 7q31 in a sample of 322 participants ascertained > for Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Replication or suggestive > replication of linkage was obtained in all of these regions, but the > evidence suggests that the genetic influences may not be identical for > the three domains. In particular, linkage analysis replicated the > influence of genes on chromosome 6p for all three domains, but > association analysis indicated that only one of the candidate genes > for reading disability, **KIAA0319, had a strong effect on language > phenotypes. The findings are consistent with a multiple gene model of the comorbidity between language impairments and reading disability and have implications for neurocognitive developmental models and maturational processes.**

Right, there isn’t a “language gene” (sorry [FOXP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP2)). Language is a complex phenotype dependent on a lot of genes which can be “broken” in a lot of different ways. Though since verbal fluency (or, verbal IQ) varies quite a bit, if not basal verbal competency, there are likely many genes which shape how well we can wield language.
