The genetics of your kids; know thyself

[Genetic Future](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/08/chinese_summer_camp_to_offer_g.php) says basically what I was going to say about report about [genetic testing for abilities in China](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/03/china.dna.children.ability/). Dan MacArthur notes:

For most traits we’re interested in the best predictors are **the parents**.
