College is just a word

Last week I pointed to the fact there seem to be a set of private educational institutions whose raison d’être is to feed at the trough of government-backed student loans. Mark Gimein [has a follow-up](http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/money-trail/2009/08/12/sue-school?page=full) at *The Big Money*. Here are some bits about the “college” which was sued by the graduate who couldn’t get a job:

> Trina Thompson’s alma mater, Monroe College, is well-known to New York > City commuters, thanks to glossy ads that festoon the insides (and > sometimes the outside) of many subway cars. It has less of a presence, > however, outside the New York public transit system. You will not find > it in, say, the U.S. News list of 1,400 colleges. You will not find its average SAT scores listed on its Web site or anywhere else (they’re not required for admission), nor will you find lists of publications by the scholars on its faculty.  
> …Though it is called a “college” and offers bachelor’s and even > master’s degrees, Monroe does not offer degrees in the kinds of > areas-say, English, economics, or the natural sciences-that most > people associate with “college.” Instead, it offers degrees in > business administration, criminal justice, and medical assistance. It > has a hospitality management program with for-credit classes in artisan bread baking and the workings of a hotel front desk. Meanwhile, **Monroe’s math offerings stop at the calculus level of a decent high school.**  
> …  
> For the education it offers, Monroe charges tuition of \$5,872 a > semester (including a \$400 “administrative fee”). For comparison, the > City University of New York, whose Lehman College campus is not far > from Monroe and offers the range of academic programs in the arts and > sciences that most people expect of a college, charges \$2,300 for > in-state students; the local community colleges cost less. The > education that Monroe offers is geared toward what is ostensibly > valuable in the work world. Trina Thompson told me that her courses included classes in Word, Excel, and Web design; in the course catalog, you’ll find even more basic offerings, including a college credit course in “keyboarding.”  
> …At Binghamton University, the flagship campus of New York’s public > system, 1.5 percent of students default on their loans. At Lehman, a school with average SAT math plus verbal scores around 870 (well below the national average for college freshman), the number is 3.2 percent.  
> **At Monroe the numbers are much worse. Of the students who were to > start repaying their loans in 2006, 9.5 percent are already in > default.** That’s three times higher than at nearby Lehman and 80 percent higher than the national average of 5.2% (a number that is itself elevated by the dismal record of for-profit schools like Monroe).

  
I focus on the issue of student loans in my posts because of complexities of moral culpability here. Many student loans are subsidized, which probably has an inflationary effect on the cost of tuition, so at more expensive universities many take out unsubsidized loans to make up the balance. Additionally, student loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy excluding extreme hardship cases. This a case where public policy is oriented in a very specific direction so as to incentivize attainment of undergraduate degrees.  
The problem is that a non-trivial set of students seek the college degree because it has been transformed into the new high school diploma. And many of these students intersect with near-scams like Monroe college.  
Part of the issue is that there isn’t much discussion about the reality that a bachelor’s degree as a label doesn’t magically turn one into an engine of economic productivity in and of itself. College is supposed to broaden your horizons and allow you to think (liberal arts), or, it can give you very specialized pre-professional education (e.g., engineering degrees). But that’s not how it’s working out for many people, which means that the signalling value of a college education is rapidly decreasing as more mediocre students get funneled into lowest-common-denominator degree-mills. All the while, [the cost of higher education is still outpacing inflation](http://chronicle.com/article/Higher-Education-Price-Index/42813).
