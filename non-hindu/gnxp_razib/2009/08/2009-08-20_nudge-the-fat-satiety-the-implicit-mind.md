Nudge the fat; satiety & the implicit mind

Megan McArdle has has been [talking about the high heritability](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/21958?in=02:03&out=11:53) of [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) again. I have [expressed concern](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/07/heritability_of_height_vs_weig.php) about her putting the high heritability numbers out there when it comes to its relevance for public policy, though I do tend to agree with her general stance that glib assertions about the importance of will-power are probably non-starters. And, rather than point to arguments such as “I have a slow metabolism,” it is probably more critical emphasize the complexity of the chain of events and framing of how we make decisions, much of which occurs “under the hood” and outside the purview of conscious explicit control. Interestingly, the reality that choice is highly conditioned by details of our environment combined with innate predispositions, and proximately is driven by many implicit factors, has pushed me in a less libertarian direction.

In any case, the whole discussion got me interested in the topic of obesity & heritability, and I found this review, [Human Obesity: A Heritable Neurobehavioral Disorder That Is Highly Sensitive to Environmental Conditions](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/57/11/2905.full). You can read the full text, it’s Open Access now, but this part caught my attention:

Unlike the â€œthrifty geneâ€? hypothesis, this scenario provides a credible explanation for the fact that even in places where obesity is very common, a substantial proportion of the population remains lean.

This is an old hobby horse of mine: **if you see a quantitative trait which can be conceived of as normally distributed with a high degree of heritability, such as body mass index, then its fitness implication can’t have been too stark.** In other words, if a very heritable trait still has a great deal of extant genetic variation, then it is either in transient, or, more likely the fitness implication of any particular trait value was low or there is balancing dynamics preserving the variance. Like IQ, body weight has been increasing over the past century. Many people think that they know the reason why this is occurring. If the reasons are ever established to a high degree of certitude, is it possible to reverse the slouch toward obesity without coercion?
