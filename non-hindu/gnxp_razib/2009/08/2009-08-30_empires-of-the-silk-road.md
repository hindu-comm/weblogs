Empires of the Silk Road

I’m now reading [Empires of the Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691135894/geneexpressio-20/). I’m about 2/3 of the way through the main text, and being slowed down by the fact that I keep reading the footnotes on almost every page. Additionally, there are 40 pages or so of endnotes which I haven’t gotten to yet, but each one reads like a very interesting blog post (I do not refer to it as such to cast aspersions but praise!). I’ll probably have my full thoughts up in a few days. It has a little less ecology and archaeology than I’d like so far, but the density of fact is pretty awesome ([The Ruin of the Roman Empire](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//0060787414/geneexpressio-20/) is a book where the opposite is the case, it could have been about half as long due to its repeated exposition of the same series of facts with a slight twist). There are some issues where genetics might offer a slightly different perspective than the author, and I’ll definitely mention that….
