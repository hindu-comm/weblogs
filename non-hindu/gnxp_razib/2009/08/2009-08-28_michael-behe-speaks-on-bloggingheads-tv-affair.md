Michael Behe speaks on bloggingheads.tv affair

Addendum to my two posts below, here’s [Michael Behe’s side](http://behe.uncommondescent.com/2009/08/bloggingheads-tv-and-me/). He notes:

> …and John emailed back that he himself requested the video to be > pulled because people thought he was too easy on me, which was > supposedly contrary to that old Bloggingheads spirit. I find that > quite implausible (other shows on the site feature discussions between > people who agree on many things). Rather, I suspect the folks at the website weren’t expecting the vitriolic reaction, began to worry about their good names and future employment prospects, pictured themselves banished to a virtual leper colony, panicked, and folded.

Behe is correct. The producers do prefer some disagreement (participants refer to this injunction), but it often doesn’t crop up. I would say that the majority of diavlogs don’t exhibit much of an adversarial spirit. The problem was the lack of adversarial spirit **and** the content, that is, the crankery. When historian of science Ronald Numbers had a [discussion](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/ron-number-paul-nelson-bloggingheads/) with Paul Nelson, a Young Earth Creationist, it was in an anthropological spirit. In contrast McWhorter verged on advocacy.
