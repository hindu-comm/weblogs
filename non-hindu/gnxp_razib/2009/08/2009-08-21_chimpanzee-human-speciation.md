Chimpanzee & human speciation

Thomas Mailund on [Doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees](http://www.mailund.dk/index.php/2009/08/19/doubts-about-complex-speciation-between-humans-and-chimpanzees/):

> Two patterns from large-scale DNA sequence data have been put forward > as evidence that speciation between humans and chimpanzees was > complex, involving hybridization and strong selection. First, > divergence between humans and chimpanzees varies considerably across > the autosomes. Second, divergence between humans and chimpanzees (but > not gorillas) is markedly lower on the X chromosome. Here, we describe > how simple speciation and neutral molecular evolution explain both > patterns. In particular, the wide range in autosomal divergence is > consistent with stochastic variation in coalescence times in the > ancestral population; and the lower human-chimpanzee divergence on the > X chromosome is consistent with species differences in the strength of > male-biased mutation caused by differences in mating system. We also highlight two further patterns of divergence that are problematic for the complex speciation model. **Our conclusions raise doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees.**
