Religion & sex

It seems looking at the GSS that:

1\) The more secularized a population segment is, [the bigger the sex difference in beliefs](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/women_bow_down_before_the_male.php). This is in keeping with [Bryan Caplanâ€™s](http://econlog.econlib.org/) thesis that males become more secular once social and institutional pressures are relaxed to a greater extent than females.

2\) Among the segment of the population which is rather religious to begin with (which includes more women than men) [males & females are in accord](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/women_are_more_fundamentalist.php) in terms of beliefs.
