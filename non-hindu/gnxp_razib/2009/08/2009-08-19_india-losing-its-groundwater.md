India losing its groundwater

Americans know that the [Ogallala Aquifer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer) is important, and declining. This is much more of an issue in India, [Satellites Unlock Secret To Northern India’s Vanishing Water](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090812143938.htm):

> Using satellite data, UC Irvine and NASA hydrologists have found that groundwater beneath northern India has been receding by as much as 1 foot per year over the past decade – and they believe human consumption is almost entirely to blame.

Here’s a map of the population density of India by district:

And now a map of the change in the levels of groundwater (red = decline, blue = increase):

The original letter to *Nature*, [Satellite-based estimates of groundwater depletion in India](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7258/abs/nature08238.html):

Punjab and Haryana are the “breadbaskets” of India, where modern farming has pushed aside subsistence. This resulted in India becoming an exporter of wheat.
