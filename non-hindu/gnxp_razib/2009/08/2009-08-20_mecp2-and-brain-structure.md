MECP2 and brain structure

*ScienceDaily*, [Genetic Variations Linked To Brain Size](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090818130559.htm). The write-up seems a bit garbled to me, so probably best to read the paper, *A common MECP2 haplotype associates with reduced cortical surface area in humans in two independent populations*, when it is live on the [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/) site.
