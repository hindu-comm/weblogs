Americans have been Hindus for a long time

[Rod Dreher](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/08/we-are-all-hindus-now.html) is [aghast](http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/08/we-are-all-hindus-now.html) at the fact that Americans don’t assent to the views of “orthodox” Christianity. The problem that many secular and religious people on the extremes don’t get (the anti-devout and the devout) is the cognitive complexity, and, frankly, the fundamental incoherency of the religious beliefs of most humans. In [The Future of Religion: Secularization, Revival and Cult Formation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520057317/geneexpressio-20/) the authors report survey data from the early 1980s which shows that most American Christians would not definitely deny that Hindus could achieve salvation:

|                                                                    |                       |                    |                       |                     |                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------:|----------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------:|--------------------:|--------------------:|
|                                                                    |                       |                    |                       |                     |                     |
|                                                                    | **Missouri Lutheran** | **South. Baptist** | **Assemblies of God** | **All Protestants** | **Roman Catholics** |
| **Being of the Hindu religion would definitely prevent salvation** |                    40 |                 32 |                    41 |                  14 |                   2 |

(the above data are not totally comparable to the Pew results, but they show the broad extent of these sentiments a generation ago)  
Dreher may be more rigorous than most (he’s been a member of three Christian denominations, as well as not being religious), but even he isn’t [immune to putting rigor to the side](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/10/rod-dreher-leaves-catholicism-for.php) when needful. Rod Dreher did not dig deep into reasoned critiques of Catholic doctrines *until* those criticisms might be some utility. This is not atypical.
