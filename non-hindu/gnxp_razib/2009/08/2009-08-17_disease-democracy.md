Disease & democracy

[Fat Tax](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/magazine/16FOB-wwln-t.html?src=sch&pagewanted=print):

> Which is why it is so striking to talk to Delos M. Cosgrove, the heart > surgeon who is the clinic’s chief executive, about the initiative. > Cosgrove says that if it were up to him, if there weren’t legal > issues, he would not only stop hiring smokers. **He would also stop hiring obese people.** When he mentioned this to me during a recent phone conversation, I told him that I thought many people might consider it unfair. He was unapologetic.

The country has grown > fat because it’s consuming more calories and burning fewer. Our > national weight problem brings huge costs, both medical and economic. Yet our anti-obesity efforts have none of the urgency of our antismoking efforts. **“We should declare obesity a disease and say we’re going to help you get over it,”** Cosgrove said.

The [proportion of smokers](http://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/news/20081113/smoking-rate-is-declining-in-us) is declining, and now below 20%. The proportion who are obese is going in the other direction, and [pushing above 25%](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2009/07/growing-obesity-swells-healthcare-costs.html). In any case, why not discriminate against older workers, who are presumably a public health liability? Probably because there’s a perception you can control your obesity, and not your age.
