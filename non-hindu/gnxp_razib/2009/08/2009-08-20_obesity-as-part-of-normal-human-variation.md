Obesity as part of normal human variation

![venus_statue.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/venus_statue.jpg?resize=170%2C318)![venus_statue.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/venus_statue.jpg?resize=170%2C318)[Common body mass index-associated variants confer risk of extreme obesity](http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/18/18/3502?rss=1):

As I’m sure you know, some traits, like [pigmentation](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=pigmentation+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search), are controlled by variation on a few genes, a half a dozen. For example, one locus, *SLC24A5* controls 25-40% of the complexion variation between Europeans and Africans, and can account for he same proportion of complexion variation among South Asians. By contrast, variation in [height](https://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062:uyrcvn__yd0&q=height+site:http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/&sa=Search) is explained by genes of much smaller effect, excepting distinct phenotypes such as [dwarfism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism).  
These data reiterate that though genes such as FTO are of particular interest in relation to variation in body mass index should probably be viewed as a quantitative trait, whereby the obese are simply at the “tail” of the distribution which emerges in response to a particular environment. This is what I mean (these are not *real* distributions!):

As you can see, simply changing the environment will result in an increase in the number who are defined as obese (BMI \>= 30) as the tail of the distribution moves to the right….
