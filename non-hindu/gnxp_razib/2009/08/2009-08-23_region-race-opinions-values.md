Region & race; opinions & values

In the post below I combined some of the Census Regions for reasons of sample size. But I decided to do this again without combining, but removing some of the questions because of small sample sizes. Again, I also limited the sample to whites between 1998-2008.

But, I added another category: blacks. [Michael Lind](http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/08/11/south/index.html) said:

But taken as a whole, black culture is \[redacted\]. > Barack Obama can pretty it up all he wants, but it’s a \[redacted\].” > Or maybe this: “There are, needless to say, plenty of individual Jews > who are wholly admirable. But taken as a whole, Jewish culture is > \[redacted\]. The late Irving Howe can pretty it up all he wants, but > it’s a \[redacted\].”

As hinted in Lind’s piece, **the group of white Americans that black Americans resemble most of their values and outlook are Southerners, in particular the most culturally conservative Southern block.** On a host of social issues black Americans resemble white Americans from Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee. But, since they vote Democrat all is forgiven I suppose. Now, if I blacks ever did start voting their social attitudes, I wonder what equivalent of “crackers” they would be labelled. Oh, [wait](http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2008/11/n-word-and-raci.html)….  
**Addendum:** Removing political party affiliation, and the correlation between blacks and the “East South Central” goes from 0.89 to 0.95.
