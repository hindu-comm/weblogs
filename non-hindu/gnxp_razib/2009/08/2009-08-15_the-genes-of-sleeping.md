The genes of sleeping

[p-ter](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/08/sleep-genetics.php) reports on a fascinating new paper, [The Transcriptional Repressor DEC2 Regulates Sleep Length in Mammals](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/325/5942/866):

> Sleep deprivation can impair human health and performance. Habitual > total sleep time and homeostatic sleep response to sleep deprivation > are quantitative traits in humans. Genetic loci for these traits have > been identified in model organisms, but none of these potential animal > models have a corresponding human genotype and phenotype. We have > identified a mutation in a transcriptional repressor (hDEC2-P385R) > that is associated with a human short sleep phenotype. Activity > profiles and sleep recordings of transgenic mice carrying this > mutation showed increased vigilance time and less sleep time than > control mice in a zeitgeber time- and sleep deprivation-dependent manner. These mice represent a model of human sleep homeostasis that provides an opportunity to probe the effect of sleep on human physical and mental health.
