Markus Jokela speaks; women getting more beautiful

The author of the paper, [Physical attractiveness and reproductive success in humans: evidence from the late 20th century United States](http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(09)00027-0/abstract), [speaks](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/mmjokela/women-are-getting-more-beautiful-getting-the-story-right/):

> Having your study publicized by the media is nice. Having your study > misrepresented and misinterpreted in the process is not. The media > coverage of my paper on physical attractiveness and having children > had a bad start and even worse follow-up. The origin of the problem: > Times Online news article sexing up the finding a bit too much (I > wasn’t interviewed for this article at all and heard about it only > after it had been published). Then things got worse with other > journalists copying & slightly modifying the Times Online piece. > Naturally, things were further muddled by the > If-I-were-a-movie-critic-I-would-rate-movies-without-seeing-them-and-just-by-relying-on-discussions-overheard-in-a-pub > columnists, the > I-haven’t-read-the-paper-but-here’s-my-take-on-it-anyway bloggers and the ever so alert This-research-is-nonsense-I-want-my-tax-money-back-even-if-the-research-was-not-funded-by-my-tax-money readers.  
> …  
> On the more amusing side, the media flurry did have one funny > unintended consequence. The Fox News covered the story by telling the > viewers that evolution is driving women to become even more beautiful. A note to future historians: when tracing back the turning point at which conservatives begun to believe in the theory of evolution, please cite my article.  
> Oh well, my article had its 15 minutes of fame. Not the fame it would > have deserved, but anyway. My guess is that nobody remembers the > article anymore; it has already been 7 days since the Times Online > report. I don’t believe this commentary will be read even by 1% of > those who have read the news articles of Times Online and others. It > is merely damage control targeted to people who come across my study in blog & newspaper archives sometime in the future. At the moment, there seems to be more pressing news in the horizon, reported with the accuracy and moderation so characteristic to professional journalism:

The original paper is [here](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/mmjokela/files/2009/07/jokela_attractiveness_fertility_ehb.pdf). Jokela says that the [Forbes piece](http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/27/women-attractiveness-study-markets-faces-science.html?feed=rss_personalfinance) was accurate. The rest of it, not so much, and he points out that the [Times Online](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article6727710.ece) story spread virally and was the original source of the misinformation.  
Since I got carried away and didn’t read the paper before commenting, I apologize. I have a general rule, “beware of tales told in British newspapers” (most because of all the made up stuff they printed after 9/11), but I forgot that here. Live & learn. Jokela’s response is thorough, so please check it out. Or, read his [paper](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/mmjokela/files/2009/07/jokela_attractiveness_fertility_ehb.pdf), which he has placed on his website.
