The genome, more than coding

[Evolutionary Processes Acting on Candidate *cis*-Regulatory Regions in Humans Inferred from Patterns of Polymorphism and Divergence](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000592). Let me just jump to the final paragraph since thatâ€™s probably what most readers are curious about:

> Our analysis of human polymorphism and divergence in conserved > non-coding sites suggests that the evolution of candidate > cis-regulatory regions is often driven by both positive and negative > selection. Our findings reinforce the idea that the non-coding portion > of our genome has an important functional and evolutionary role, and > suggest that patterns of natural selection in non-coding DNA are often > distinct from that of protein-coding regions. **Many of the adaptive > changes in candidate cis-regulatory regions might have occurred near > genes expressed in the fetal brain, supporting the hypothesis that the > evolution of the developing brain may be largely attributable to > changes in gene regulation.** Our results add to the increasing evidence that non-coding DNA is not all selectively neutral, and that selection on candidate cis-regulatory regions has played an important role throughout hominid evolution.

[Gene regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression) has of course been one possible solution to how humans can be so phenotypically different from chimpanzees despite close sequence level identity.
