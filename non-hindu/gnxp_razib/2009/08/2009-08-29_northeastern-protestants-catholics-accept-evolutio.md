Northeastern Protestants & Catholics accept evolution

On a lark I decided to see how Catholics & Protestants broke down in regards to evolution by American region in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08). Specifically, I clustered the [Census Divisions](http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/reps/maps/us_census.html) to create the categories of:  
Northeast = New England + Mid Atlantic  
Midwest = E & W North Central  
South = S Atlantic + E South Central + W South Central  
West = Mountain + Pacific  
I limited the data to non-Hispanic whites for the question “evolved,” which was asked in 2006 and 2008, so recently. Results below the fold for this question….

[TABLE]

I assume few are surprised that Catholics accept evolution at a higher rate than Protestants, this is evident in many polls going back decades. Rather, the interesting point is that **the Northeast does not exhibit much religious polarization on this question, while every other region does.** The Catholic – Protestant difference for each region is:  
Northeast – 6.8  
Midwest – 30.5  
South – 28.4  
West – 35
