Risk, personality and testosterone

[Gender differences in financial risk aversion and career choices are affected by testosterone](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/20/0907352106.short?rss=1):

> Women are generally more risk averse than men. We investigated whether > between- and within-gender variation in financial risk aversion was > accounted for by variation in salivary concentrations of testosterone > and in markers of prenatal testosterone exposure in a sample of \>500 > MBA students. Higher levels of circulating testosterone were > associated with lower risk aversion among women, but not among men. At > comparably low concentrations of salivary testosterone, however, the > gender difference in risk aversion disappeared, suggesting that > testosterone has nonlinear effects on risk aversion regardless of > gender. A similar relationship between risk aversion and testosterone > was also found using markers of prenatal testosterone exposure. > Finally, both testosterone levels and risk aversion predicted career > choices after graduation: Individuals high in testosterone and low in > risk aversion were more likely to choose risky careers in finance. > **These results suggest that testosterone has both organizational and > activational effects on risk-sensitive financial decisions and > long-term career choices.**
