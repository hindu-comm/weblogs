Differences in human universals on the margins

[Neuroskeptic](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/08/emotions-are-still-universal.html) [reviews new research](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/08/emotions-are-still-universal.html) which reports that East Asians and Europeans perceive facial expressions differently. Yes, differences do seem to exist, at least within the small sample studied, but there is a great deal of overlap. Of course much of the phenomena of interest are on the margins anyhow. Speaking of which, [Genetic and Molecular Basis of Individual Differences in Human Umami Taste Perception](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006717):

> Population diversities of SNPs in TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 have been reported > by Kim et al…Minor allele frequencies of the SNP at 372 in TAS1R1 vary > among eight populations; 10% in Cameroonian, 0% in Amerindian (native > Americans), 25% in North European, 35% in Japanese, 5% in Russian, 35% > in Hungarian, 40% in Chinese and 6% in Pakistani, whereas those at 757 in TAS1R3 showed no obvious difference among populations. **These results suggest that there may be differences in umami sensitivity related with TAS1R1-A372T among populations in the world.**
