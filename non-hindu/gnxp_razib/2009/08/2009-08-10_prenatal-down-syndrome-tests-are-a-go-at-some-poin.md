Prenatal Down syndrome tests are a go (at some point)

Last spring there was a [false alarm](http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/04/sequenom_reveals_prenatal_down.php) about a noninvasive form of prenatal testing, in particular for Down syndrome. But if [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/aug/09/research-nhs-pregnancy-blood-test) is right then the British [NHS](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/aug/09/research-nhs-pregnancy-blood-test) is [pushing forward](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/aug/09/research-nhs-pregnancy-blood-test) on a more general program in this direction:

> The early signs are so promising that the professor leading the > programme says that the risk-free test could be the standard method of > detecting babies with some genetic conditions inherited from the > father within two to three years and those with Down’s syndrome within > five – and in the process save the lives of an estimated 265 mostly > normal babies a year.

The life-saving part is that there would be far less need for amniocentesis, which is invasive and results in a risk of miscarriage. The cost vs. benefit of prenatal screening would presumably shift. Though British newspapers are inclined toward sensationalism and inaccuracy, this is probably grounded in something real.  
**H/T:** Yglesias.
