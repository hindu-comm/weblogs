Invasive species & human exceptionalism

The havoc that introduced species have caused in some areas is well known, such as Australia (most prominently, but limited to, rabbits). But the term “invasive” seems more a normative than a scientific one, after all, **at some point endemic species *were* invasive.** For example, the “pristine” ecosystems of North American before Europeans arrived were certainly reshaped in the last 10,000 years by the migration of Old World species such as bison and the gray wolf, combined with human predation and utilization of fire. In fact [recent research](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/301/5640/1710) hints that the “virgin” Amazon rainforest may actually have taken up its present form after the die-off of native populations within the last 300-400 years.
