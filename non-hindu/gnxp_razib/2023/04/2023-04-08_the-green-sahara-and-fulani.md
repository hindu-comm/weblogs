The Green Sahara and Fulani

[Echoes from the last Green Sahara: whole genome analysis of Fulani, a key population to unveil the genetic evolutionary history of Africa](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535569v1):

> Background The Sahelian Fulani are the largest nomadic pastoral ethnic > group. Their origins are still largely unknown and their Eurasian > genetic component is usually explained by recent admixture events with > northern African groups. However, it has also been proposed that > Fulani may be the descendants of ancient groups settled in the Sahara > during its last Green phase (12000-5000 BP), as also suggested by Y > chromosome results. Results We produced 23 high-coverage (30 X) whole > genomes from Fulani individuals from 8 Sahelian countries, plus 17 > samples from other African groups and 3 Europeans as controls, for a > total of 43 new whole genome sequences. These data have been compared > with 814 published modern whole genomes and analyzed together with > relevant published ancient individuals (for a total of \> 1800 > samples). These analyses showed that the non-sub-Saharan genetic > ancestry component of Fulani cannot be only explained by recent > admixture events, but it could be shaped at least in part by older > events by events more ancient than previously reported, possibly > tracing its origin to the last Green Sahara. Conclusions According to > our results, Fulani may be the descendants of Saharan cattle herders > settled in that area during the last Green Sahara. The exact ancestry > composition of such ghost Saharan population(s) cannot be completely unveiled from modern genomes only, but the joint analysis with the available African ancient samples suggested a similarity between ancient Saharans and Late Neolithic Moroccans.

Two points

– Lots of suspicion about this before. Basically, a West Eurasian-related population (admixed) was extant in the Sahara for the first half of the Holocene.

– I don’t think they’ve totally figured out Afro-Asiatic, and these results make me more open to the idea that Afro-Asiatic came from the Sahara, not less
