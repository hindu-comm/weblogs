Open Thread: Ash and Elm…

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/41iydS85lL._AC_UF700800_QL80_.jpg?resize=194%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/41iydS85lL._AC_UF700800_QL80_.jpg?resize=194%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08BH3PHQL/geneexpressio-20)I’m rereading [Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08BH3PHQL/geneexpressio-20), along with some other books on the Vikings and Scandinavians. Also revisiting papers like [Population genomics of Mesolithic Scandinavia: Investigating early postglacial migration routes and high-latitude adaptation](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003703), which I believe reports the first individual that almost certainly had light hair and eyes in the ancient DNA record (look at “Sbj”). You can probably guess why I’m doing this, why I’m reading these papers and books. At the same time I also have started listening to “Viking music,” which is its own genre. It’s a nice juxtaposition.

I do not have much time for this blog right now, between the [Substack](https://razib.substack.com/) and my primary focus, [GenRAIT](https://genrait.com/), which we introduced to the world at [PAG 30](https://www.intlpag.org/30/) (we’re still rai\$ing, so if you an angel you know to reach me).

But I’ll keep posting here now and then as usual. This blog has been going for more than 20 years now (since the spring of 2002).
