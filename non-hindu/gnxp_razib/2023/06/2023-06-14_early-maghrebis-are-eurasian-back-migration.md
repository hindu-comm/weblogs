Early Maghrebis are Eurasian back-migration

A new ancient DNA paper from Northwest Africa: [Northwest African Neolithic initiated by migrants from Iberia and Levant](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06166-6):

Basically, the ancestors of the Berbers seem to be a mix of indigenous people whose ancestors were Eurasians who arrived during the Last Glacial Maximum, Early European Farmers (Anatolian) and Levantine farmers/pastoralists, in that order of timing, but reverse order of contribution. To me it is interesting that there is no Sub-Saharan African ancestry in the earliest populations, indicating that the Sahara was really not habitable for humans for much of the Ice Age.
