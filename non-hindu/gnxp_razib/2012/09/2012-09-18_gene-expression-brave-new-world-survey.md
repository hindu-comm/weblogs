Gene Expression Brave New World Survey

A few weeks ago [I mentioned that I wanted do another survey](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/a-survey-on-genes-behavior-etc/). I’ve done a fair number of reader surveys since the mid-2000s of my readership. So, for example, I know that you’re politically well balanced, except for social conservatives (who are very underrepresented). You are also extremely male, pale, well educated, atheistic, and prone to being virgins at a higher clip than your age might suggest. So I didn’t want to overload on demographic questions this time. Rather, **I wanted to know about specific responses to specific *controversial* questions.** So I titled it the “Brave New World Survey” this time, because of the focus on uncomfortable questions and the like.

Mostly, I’m tired of arguing with readers about what is, and isn’t, controversial. My readership has a lot of intellectual oddballs (probably because as an [atheist brown conservative](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/us/19beliefs.html) I am one). So I assume I’m sampling from the extreme end of the pool in terms of openness to heterodoxy, so we’ll see how it shakes out.

I haven’t used this survey software before, so take that as a warning. I put the survey as an iframe below the fold, but it didn’t work too well. So please [go to the link here](http://fluidsurveys.com/surveys/razibkhan/brave-new-world-survey/). It’s all one one page, so you should be able to complete it quickly (you can omit questions you want to omit).

When 100 responses come up, I’ll post a summary below the fold. I’ll do so with every hundred. Usually I make it to \~500 responses for this weblog. Also, I’ll try and figure out how to export it once I close the survey (personally information won’t be in the export, so don’t worry).

**Update:** If it didn’t work when you tried it earlier, try it now. I didn’t set it ‘live’ because I’m stupid.
