Joseph Smith prophesied ASHG 2012

The [ASHG 2012](http://www.ashg.org/2012meeting/pages/abstracts.shtml) website says that their abstract search feature will go online “on/after September 6, 2012.” It’s 13 minutes after on the west coast of the USA as I write this, so I guess after? So I decided to double-check the teasers where you can page through authors last name by last name. Under “A” there was this entry that intrigued me:

I Googled the author. The first hit really surprised me,[josephsmithdna.com](http://www.josephsmithdna.com/). I guess I can connect the dots for the rest of the poster. Because of the Nephites, Jaredites, and all the other mythological peoples in the Book of Mormon I can see how Saints are motivated to tease apart the genealogy of Amerindian populations. I don’t think they’ll find what they’re looking for, but if it furthers science I can’t complain too much.
