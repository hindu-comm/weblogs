Further survey results

I have now reformatted the responses into a [csv file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32549456/bravenewworld.csv). So you can do something boring like create a scatterplot with Excel, as above. Or, you can import into R and dig for more interesting patterns. Here is an updated to the PDF which shows you the simple [non-crossed results](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/32549456/report_100198%20%282%29.pdf).

Also, out of curiosity I separated respondents into geneticists vs. non-biologists (so I exclude biologists who are **not** geneticists from this analysis). First, here are the non-biologists on race:

And now the geneticists:

For what itâ€™s worth, I agree with the 66% of geneticists. The sample size is small and biased, but still interesting nonetheless.
