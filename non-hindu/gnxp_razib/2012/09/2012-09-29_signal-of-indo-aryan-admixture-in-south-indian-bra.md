Signal of Indo-Aryan admixture in South Indian Brahmins

I’ve mentioned a few times that the [Reich lab](http://www.harappadna.org/2012/06/ani-asi-admixture-dating/) has been finding suggestive evidence for admixture between indigenous South Asians and a West Eurasian group on the order of \~3,000 years before the present. The modal explanation is probably [an Indo-Aryan intrusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_peoples#Origins). [Dienekes](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2012/09/rolloff-analysis-of-south-indian.html) used *rolloff* in [ADMIXTOOLS](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/09/admixtools-is-out/) to repeat these general findings. Specifically, **he found signal for an admixture event *analogous* to one between non-Brahmin South Indians and Northern Europeans.** I say analogous because I do not mean to imply that the admixture was exactly of this form. Rather, there are general resemblances in the genetic profiles across the four groups (i.e., Orcadian & North Kannadi, and population X and Y which merged to form South Indian Brahmins).

  
The only thing I would add is that the North Kannadi, representative of non-Brahmin South Indians, are themselves a mixture between West Eurasian and an indigenous South Asian population. And, looking at the patterns of admixture in [Harappa](http://www.harappadna.org/), it seems to me that South Indian Brahmins themselves have some admixture which postdates their arrival to South India, which is probably 1 to 2,000 years before the present. In the specific case of South Indian Brahmins my model would be:

1\) West Asian + Ancestral South Indian = Population A

2\) Population A + Indo-Aryan = Population B

3\) Population B + Population A \[South Indian\] = South Indian Brahmin

I would weight the first admixture event heaviest, and the two second ones of approximately equal strength. Though the third is a secondary admixture, and so I wonder if the signal would be obscure.
