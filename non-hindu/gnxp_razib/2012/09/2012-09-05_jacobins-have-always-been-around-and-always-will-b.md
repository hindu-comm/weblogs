Jacobins have always been around, and always will be around

Recently I stumbled onto to something called [Atheism+](http://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/2012/08/atheism/), which seems to have issued out of [Freethought Blogs](http://freethoughtblogs.com/). Here’s an assertion that caught my attention:

> We are…  
> Atheists*plus*we care about social justice,  
> Atheists*plus*we support women’s rights,

As others have stated Atheism+ seems to be a reemergence and rebranding of an old strand of anti-religious thought (secular humanism updated for the 21st century). More specifically, that element which is strongly attached to cultural radicalism, and seemingly to utopianism. Radical utopians aren’t always wrong. The [Jacobins abolished slavery](https://modernhistorian.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-this-day-in-history-french-abolish.html). But in the process of making an omelettethey do have a track record of breaking a lot of eggs. I went to an atheist meeting in Berkeley a few years ago where a card-carrying Communist showed up. I don’t agree with Communism (you shall judge them by their fruits), but it’s a forcefully articulated world-view. In contrast many “freethought activists” tend to focus narrowly on church-state issues and what not. There are other ideologies which have mixed atheism with a philosophy of life, such as Objectivism. Atheism+ may be the home for those with a more explicit self-conscious far Left cultural outlook.

And as with most anti-religious ideologies Atheism+ espouses “critical thinking and skepticism.” This didn’t seem to work out too well for Objectivism, and I wish Atheism+ (or New Atheism, or whatever) would really just get off it, **because there are some things that are obviously not going to be subject to critique or skepticism**. If you do subject those things to critique, you’ll probably be called a “[douchebag](http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/2207/).” Atheism+, like many of the new atheist movements, seems to be attempting to generate a “thick” system of values to supplement spare anti-religious sentiment. Those values, norms, are outside of the process of critical rationalism. It’s pretty obvious if you are outside of those values, but not so obvious if you’re within those values.

Finally, going back to some of the Greek city-states, Mozi in China, and down to the early modern period with the French Revolution and the assorted Left and Right “political religions” (Marxist-Leninism and Fascism), there have been plenty of attempts to jettison what visionary great minds perceived to be “garbage.” The truth seems to be that one man’s garbage is another man’s fertilizer. Remove the fertilizer and sometimes the flowers don’t grow. Reduction and reconstitution is great in science. I’m not sure that it’s so great as a philosophy of life.
