The moral measure of bad teeth

Recently I was at the dentist and I was told that because I did not have any [caries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caries)at this age, I would probably not have to worry about that in the future (in contrast, I do have some issues with [gingivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis)). I wasn’t surprised that I didn’t have caries, **I have no great love of sweet confections.**I had chalked up my evasion of this dental ailment to my behavior. To make a long story short my dentist disabused me of the notion that dental pathologies are purely a function of dental hygiene and diet. Rather, he explained that many of these ailments exhibit strong family and ethnic patterns, and are substantially heritable. My mother did suffer from [periodontal disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease) a few years back, and that has made me much more proactive of my own dental health.

As someone who is quite conscious of the power of genetics, I was quite taken aback by this blind spot. I realized that not only did I attribute my own rather fortunate dental health (so far) to my personal behaviors, but, I had long suspected those with dental issues of less than optimal habits. Obviously environment (e.g., high sugar diet) does matter. But apparently a great deal of the variation in the trait is heritable. If you are still curious, here’s a paper which might interest you, [Heritable patterns of tooth decay in the permanent dentition: principal components and factor analyses](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6831/12/7).
