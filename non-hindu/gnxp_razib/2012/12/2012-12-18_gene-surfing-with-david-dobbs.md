Gene surfing with David Dobbs

Over at *National Geographic* David Dobbs of [Neuron Culture](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/neuronculture/) has an eminently readable and engrossing piece up, [Restless Genes](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/restless-genes/dobbs-text). I have never really read about [‘allele surfing’](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/482.full) on the wave of demographic expansion in the way that Dobbs’ rendered it. I certainly wouldn’t have been able to produce that sort of spare but informative prose.

On Twitter there was some concern about the focus on *DRD4*. The issue is a general one in much of [behavioral genomics](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php), and I’m not too interested in rehashing the point. But the broader question of **heritability of behavior remains**. It seems to me that we have some ‘natural experiments’ now. For the past 50 years there have been a series of cross-cultural adoptions from Asia to North America and Europe. If human behavior variation across and within populations is substantially heritable than this might be a good place to start. Rather than focusing on genes, we need to focus on heritability first.
