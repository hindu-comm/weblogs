On getting gated papers

I get a fair number of emails (often press release blasts) to my public address, contactgnxp -at- gmail -dot- com. Of these a non-trivial are requests for papers. If I have access to a paper I always send that paper. That being said I’ve confused some of these emails for publicist-junk mail and what not. So if you want a paper please do this:

1\) Put the paper name in the title, perhaps with the preamble “paper request:”

2\) Put the link to the paper in the body. You don’t need to put anything else besides the link, I always will send the paper if I have access to it. If I don’t respond to you immediately, there are two reasons. I’m busy and am not checking my public email, or, I don’t have access.

Though projects like [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) is making this less of an issue, it does seem like high profile empirically oriented publications of interest are still moving toward*Nature*and *Science*.
