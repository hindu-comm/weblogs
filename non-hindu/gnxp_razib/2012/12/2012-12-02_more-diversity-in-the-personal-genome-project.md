More diversity in the Personal Genome Project

Reader Paul brought this to my attention. I haven’t been too interested in the PGP for myself because it’s just so slow to “play” with whole genomes (\~3 GB) as opposed to 1 million SNPs. But over Christmas I’ll look into signing up, and see if they are interested in my own “trio.” I also thought I’d pass this along to readers, though my readership actually looks almost exactly like current PGP participants, so I don’t know if I’ll be contributing to the problem.
