The arcologies arise

[How U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print):

> Apple executives say that going overseas, at this point, is their only > option. One former executive described how the company relied upon a > Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves. Apple had redesigned the iPhone’s screen at the last minute, forcing an assembly line overhaul. New screens began arriving at the plant near midnight. >
> **A foreman immediately roused 8,000 workers inside the company’s > dormitories, according to the executive. Each employee was given a > biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames.** Within 96 hours, the plant was producing over 10,000 iPhones a day. >
> “The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,” the executive said. “There’s no American plant that can match that.”

The story emphasizes that labor costs are not the primary issue here. There is the natural discussion of skill levels, and the sheer number of Chinese works coming online. But there simply is no way that [Foxconn City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn#China) could exist in the United States today. There is no way I can deny the [massive quality of life improvements in China over the past generation](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sh_dyn_mort&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=world&idim=country:CHN&ifdim=world&tstart=-313862400000&tend=1264060800000&icfg&iconSize=0.5). But, the flip side of this is that a way of life has now emerged organically in places like Shenzen which is rather reminiscent of late 19th and early 20th century dystopian visions of the industrial future.
