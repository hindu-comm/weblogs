"Doctors don't cure nothing"

**NSFW**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I observed [before](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/11/social-psychology-like-medical-science-except-it-doesnt-kill-you/), modern medicine is subject to some of the same statistical issues as social science in its tendency to put unwarranted spotlight on preferred false positive results. [Trials and Errors – Why Science Is Failing Us](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_causation/all/1):

I need to look at the difference between mortality and morbidity here. The two are clearly related, but if modern medicine has decreased morbidity, then it is still worthwhile to a greater extent than simple life expectancy calculations might indicate. But the reality is that the more and more I look at modern medicine the more worried I get that **the age old heuristics and biases which allowed medicine to flourish as a form of counterproductive psychotherapy up until the early 20th century are now coming back to the fore.** The issue here is less the profession of medicine, as the incentives and impulses which drive the need for a “cure” from the demand side.

All this brings to mind a passage from the book [Religion Explained](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465006965/geneexpressio-20):

With all due respect to modern scientifically trained physicians, but the demands that their patients are now making upon them in terms of curing diseases whose causal roots are less than clear are transforming them into latter-day shamans. As it was, it will be?
