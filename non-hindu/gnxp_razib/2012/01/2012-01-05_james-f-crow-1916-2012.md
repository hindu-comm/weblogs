James F. Crow, 1916-2012

Sad news. [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/history/genetics/james-f-crow-1916-2012.html) passes along that [James F. Crow](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/history/genetics/james-f-crow-1916-2012.html) has died. Further [mention](http://ncse.com/news/2012/01/james-f-crow-dies-007045) from the [National Center For Science Education](http://ncse.com/). A little over 5 years ago I sent Crow an email with only minimal expectation of response, asking about an interview. He [responded in less than 24 hours!](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2006/06/10-questions-for-jim-crow.php) I think it says a lot about the man that he would respond to sincere questions out of the blue from basically a nobody. Here is his [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Crow). And remember that [Genetics](http://www.genetics.org/) has commissioned a series of retrospective essays in Crowâ€™s honor.
