Socialized medicine + personal genomics = ?

My own working assumption is that the **demand** side impulse toward mass adoption of human genomic technology in the USA is going to be dampened by fear of downside consequences, [GINA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act) notwithstanding. Rather, I assume that the more deregulated consumer environment in parts of Asia with very low fertility rates, as well as European states with more thorough socialized medical systems, will “punch above their weight” in this domain. It looks likes a genuine socialized medical system (i.e., the doctors are state employees), that of the UK, is preparing to step up to the plate, [Genomic innovation will better target treatment in the NHS](http://mediacentre.dh.gov.uk/2012/01/25/genomic-innovation-will-better-target-treatment/):

Many researchers believe that personal genomics will really not hit the biomedical sweet spot until you have on the order of a million people sequenced. But even then in the American system how to get a hold of all that information is going to be problematic, since it will likely be decentralized. In contrast in Britain tens of millions of people have one primary healthcare provider, their national government.

You can read the [full report online](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_132382.pdf) (PDF). Like the “rise of China,” the “rise of genomics,” was one of those futurist predictions. Until now. It’s ridiculous to talk about the rise of something which has risen. Now it’s about maturity and ripening.
