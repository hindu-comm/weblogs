Genetic profiling: CSI edition

Apparently the national media is reporting that [scientific genealogy may result in leads to a cold case](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Will-genealogy-crack-mystery-of-Federal-Way-2455313.php). The principle is simple: apparently Y chromosomal material was matched to public genealogy databases. From this the researcher concluded that the perpetrator is probably a male line descendant of Robert Fuller of Salem, Massachusetts. Contrary to the urban legends it does not seem that false paternity rates are much higher than [\~1 percent](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/06/the-paternity-myth-the-rarity-of-cuckoldry/) in many societies ([for example](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513811001115)).

[CeCe Moore](http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/01/using-public-y-dna-profiles-to-track.html) and [Blaine Bettinger](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2012/01/11/does-dna-link-1991-killing-to-colonial-era-family/) have covered this story in detail, so I won’t go much further in this specific case. But as more and more people get typed and sequenced I suspect that genetic material is going to be more and more “actionable.” What long term effects will this have? Will criminals start taking precautions?
