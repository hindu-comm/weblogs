The future is here

Believe it or not I am probably mildly skeptical about the possibilities for the 21st century as a canvas for human flourishing. That is one reason I like to emphasize the positive, because it is important for me to not get caught up in my own bias. Over the last two human generations (50 years) mean world life expectancy has gone from \~53 to \~69. This is easy for me forget concretely because I come from a relatively long lived family. Though all were born in British India and died in Bangladesh my grandparents lived to ages of 75, 100, 80, and 80. My grandparent who died at the age of 75 still lived 25 years longer than life expectancy in Bangladesh in the year he died.

Today I see a headline in *The New York Times*, [Majority of Chinese Now Live in Cities](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/world/asia/majority-of-chinese-now-live-in-cities.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss). For some reason I was prompted to look up the Wikipedia entry for [Shenzhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen), a city of 350,000 in 1982, which is now at 10 million. The image below of Shenzhen captures for me the poignant banality of the future present. One the one hand it is nothing special, a typical “[world city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city)” skyline. But there is also an aspect redolent of the soft focus depictions of the cities of the future in the children’s books I would read in the 1980s. The photo is proof of nothing. Rather, it is an illustration of fact.
