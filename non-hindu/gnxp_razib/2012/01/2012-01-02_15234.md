Euthanasia, not eugenics

A comment below clarified my thinking in one particular area: **is widespread genetic screening going to result in a reconsidering of the idea of ‘engineering’ society?** I realize now that in a comparative scenario this is ridiculous. The [majority of healthcare expenditure is near the end of life](http://www.medicaring.org/whitepaper/), not the beginning. In 17 years the last of the [Baby Boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer) will turn 65. The looming costs are rather straightforward. And it’s not just an issue in the United States, the whole [worlds is going gray](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/11/think_again_global_aging).



How do we handle this sort of sociological challenge? One solution lies in increased economic productivity through innovation. This is great if you can get it. But another was option is obviously something like a milquetoast form of [Logan’s Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan's_Run).\* Governor[Dick Lamm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lamm) was reputed to have said “we have a duty to die.” But not to be churlish, I observe that at 77 years of age now Lamm himself continues to be active and full of life (he made the comments when he was 50).

I’ve also been thinking about this issue because of a [radio series on learning to live with “early onset” Alzheimer’s](http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2011/12/26/alzheimers-learning-kelly). Upon further reflection I realize that I [don’t think I would want to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemlock_Society) “learn to live” with such a disease. Yes, such things are easy to say now. But perhaps it is best that we start to consider these issues as early as possible, both individually, and as a society. At the end of the day many of us would say that the point of living is to live a good life, not to *just* live.

\* The option of allowing in large numbers of immigrants is a short term solution, the source nations for migration are themselves aging.
