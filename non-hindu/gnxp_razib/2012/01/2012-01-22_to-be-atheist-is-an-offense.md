To be atheist is an offense

I have seen references to this around the web, and don’t really know if I can believe this, because the details are so disturbing to consider. So I’ll pass it on, [You can expect threats if you discuss Sharia](http://freethoughtblogs.com/maryamnamazie/2012/01/17/you-can-expect-threats-if-you-discuss-sharia/):

A crazy British Muslim threatening to kill someone for defaming the prophet isn’t too surprising. \~3 percent of British Muslim university students [think apostates should be killed](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/08/death-to-apostates-1-out-of-33-muslim-university-students-say/). **What is disturbing is that the establishment institutions are accepting this sort of disproportionate response as normal behavior.** As in centuries past it is now the atheists who are by their nature offensive, and disturbing public order.

In the Netherlands the [Dutch Muslim Party](http://www.forbes.com/sites/abigailesman/2012/01/16/muslim-party-seeks-power-in-dutch-parliament/) is going to contest for parliament. It already has some purchase in major cities with large Muslim minorities. Naturally one of its planks is to prosecute those who give offense to religion and religious people. Just jump to [article 2.2](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nederlandsemoslimpartij.nl%2Fuploads%2Fdocumenten%2FVisie-document%2520vs%25202.pdf). Welcome to multiculturalism!

In other news, an atheist has been charged with blasphemy in the world’s largest Muslim nation, where Islam is a moderate religion of peace.[Dismay After Indonesian Atheist Charged With Blasphemy](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/dismay-after-indonesian-atheist-charged-with-blasphemy/492622):

He was, naturally, attacked [by a mob](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesian-atheist-attacked-charged-with-blasphemy-after-denying-gods-existence-on-facebook/2012/01/21/gIQAncASFQ_story.html) on his way to work.

Finally, [72 percent of the seats in Egypt’s parliament went to Islamists](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/world/middleeast/muslim-brotherhood-wins-47-of-egypt-assembly-seats.html). The Salafists nabbed 25 percent. **This is absolutely not surprising to me.**
