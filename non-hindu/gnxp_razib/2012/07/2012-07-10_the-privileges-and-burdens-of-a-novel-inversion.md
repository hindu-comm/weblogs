The privileges and burdens of a novel inversion

There’s [two](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2334.html) [papers](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2335.html) in *Nature Genetics* on the [17q21.31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17q21.31_microdeletion_syndrome), and variation of haplotypes of inversions in world wide populations. Here’s a part of the discussion from the first paper:

H2D individuals are susceptible to disease. If there is a fitness gain, there is also a loss. Despite his eugenical enthusiasms W. D. Hamilton ultimately gave up on the idea because he admitted it was difficult to predict what was beneficial and what is deleterious. Context matters. The distribution of haplotypes in this region seems to reflect echoes of deep pre-“Out of Africa” history in our species.
