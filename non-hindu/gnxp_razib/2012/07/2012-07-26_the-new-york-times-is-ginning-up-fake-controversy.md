The New York Times is ginning up fake controversy

**Update:** That charlatan David Klinghoffer seems to be [enjoying this](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2012/07/the_study_of_hu_1062581.html). As a rule I don’t follow [dishonest propagandists](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/07/23/and-finally-the-hounding-duck-can-rest/), but it’s interesting how appealing this sort of “two sides” story is to Creationists. **End Update**

Reading this article this morning, [DNA and Fossils Tell Differing Tales of Human Origins](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/science/cousins-of-neanderthals-left-dna-in-africa-scientists-report.html?_r=1&hp&pagewanted=print), really aggravated me. **I believe that it’s totally misrepresenting the tensions in the scientific process here, and misleading the public.** The standard conflict/”two views” format is used, and to disastrous effect. Here are some of the sections which I found alarming:

But the finding is **regarded skeptically > by *some* paleoanthropologists** because of the absence in the fossil > record of anything that would support the geneticists’ statistical > calculation…. >

I could have quoted the whole piece and highlighted aspects which I think mislead in terms of public perception. There’s just so much. First, a minor factual issue: **I’ve seen presentations on the East Africa Neandertal admixture, and the researchers seem to assume that that is due to “back migration” from Eurasia.** In other words, the point about Neandertals being cold-adapted is irrelevant. Second, the big issue seems to be that *some* paleoanthropologists are unhappy. This is not a debate between all paleoanthropologists and all geneticists. In fact, *some* genetics are moderately skeptical of admixture because they think it might be due to population structure in the ancient African *H. sapiens sapiens*. Even within the article you have Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist, giving a straightforward reason for why there is a mild discordance here: a lacunae in the fossil coverage across much of Africa due to difficulties of preservation.

The major dynamic to me seems to be that Richard Klein, admittedly a very prominent paleonanthropologist, is also very ticked off. He has some reason to be. Much of the framework within which he has worked is now being shifted (see [The Dawn of Human Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471252522/geneexpressio-20)). Klein’s model is that modern humans emerged as a singular speciation event within Africa, and rapidly expanded and replaced other human lineages in totality due to their peculiar genetic innovations (e.g., language). This is hard to align with the current genomic data. **But Klein’s views are not the only ones within paleoanthropology**. People like [John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/weblog), Milford Wolpoff, and Erik Trinkaus are no doubt excited by **the new statistical inference techniques because they supports their own models, more or less**.

What are you seeing here is a battle *within* paleoanthropology. It is probably correct that statistical geneticists should take more care to integrate fossils into their interpretative frameworks, but there are still plenty of fossil people who feel vindicated by the new genomic findings even granting this objection. Additionally, even those who don’t necessarily taking heart from these findings, such as Chris Stringer, are revising their own viewpoints. You can see the “other perspective” (i.e., not Klein’s) in this paper in *Journal of Human Evolution*: [Did a discrete event 200,000–100,000 years ago produce modern humans?](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724841200070X).

I do want to be clear here that I think Richard Klein and his camp are free to feel aggrieved. Science is about dispute and disagreement in many ways. But I think *The New York Times* does a disservice by confusing what is **really a *within field* controversy into one *between* two scientific teams**.
