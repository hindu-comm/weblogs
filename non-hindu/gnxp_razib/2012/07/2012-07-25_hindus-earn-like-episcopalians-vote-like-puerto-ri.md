Hindus earn like Episcopalians, vote like Puerto Ricans

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/chap6-41.png?resize=376%2C395)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/chap6-41.png?resize=376%2C395)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/chap6-41.png)A few years ago I pointed out that as among American whites [religious affiliation was often the best predictor of voting patterns](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2008/10/asian-american-republicans-its-a-christian-thing/) among Asian Americans. The Republican party is for all practical purposes the white Christian party, but the minority of Asian Americans who are conservative Protestants are quite congenial to the Republicans. Their common religion transcends the racial gap. It is also no surprise that the two most prominent Indian American politicians who are Republicans are both avowed Christians (converts). It is unlikely that a non-Christian Indian could achieve national prominence as Republican; they would have two strikes against them, their race and their religion.

Pew’s new report on Asian American religiosity, [Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths](https://www.pewforum.org/Asian-Americans-A-Mosaic-of-Faiths-social-and-political-attitudes.aspx), highlights this well. American Hindus are stridently partisan Democrats. In contrast, evangelical Asian Americans leaned toward John McCain even in 2008 (though not as much as white evangelicals). People have made comparisons between Indian Americans and Jews before, and in some ways this is facile, but when it comes to socioeconomic status and politics the similarities are striking. Like Jews, American Hindus are well off and well educated. And like Jews they are strongly Democratic. 48 percent of Hindus live in families with incomes of \$100,000 or above, and 57 percent have some graduate education. The respective value for all Americans are 16 and 12 percent. This seems to confirm [Andrew Gelman’s](http://andrewgelman.com/) supposition that it is among high income groups that cultural identity markers are particular relevant.
