Toward healthier gestations

[Neuroskeptic](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2012/07/coming-age-of-fetal-genomics.html) has a post up, [The Coming Age of Fetal Genomics](https://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2012/07/coming-age-of-fetal-genomics.html):

Years ago I joked that Armand Leroi was a [“demon geneticist”](http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/12/06/eugenics-again/) for broaching the topic of [neo-eugenics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17139290?dopt=AbstractPlus). At this point his article isn’t really timely, it’s almost passé! Recently on Facebook an evangelical Christian friend from high school posted a photo of a child with Down Syndrome, making the case for the value of such a life. We’re beyond thought experiment stage, [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling) and some of the non-invasive methods are “online.” If Armand was a dark creature, we live in the age of [Gog and Magog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog) already. The media just isn’t reporting it for whatever reason.

But I’m not here to scare you. Rather, there is a positive and ethically uncontroversial method by which we can reduce the expected mutational load of any future fetus for a wide swath of Americans. This applies particularly to people who are the core audience of this weblog. Not only am I going to put a proposition out here, but I considered the cost vs. benefit for myself (ultimately, I decided that it wasn’t worth it for various reasons). Let me go to the section of the post which highlights what I’m getting at:

It’s just the luck of the draw – **except that older > parents are at much higher risk, especially older fathers.** In the > case of our couple, she’s 28 and he’s 32.

Sperm are replicated throughout your life. There’s a hypothesis that it is through the male germline that genetic load tends to creep into the population (or, more positively, mutations which ultimately may be the source of variation which drives evolution). Circumstantial evidence implies the children of older males may have decreased quality of life (e.g., higher rates of cancer). I recently asked a researcher who has looked into the question of genetic load in humans, and he seems to lean toward the proposition that sperm quality does decrease as a linear function beyond one’s early 20s. If you are a forward thinking person I assume you’ll already have anticipated me: **massive banking of the sperm of young men may result in greatly reduced later life aggregate morbidity on the social scale.**

Obviously some of the same applies to eggs, but that’s a more difficult and expensive procedure. And, the storage conditions have to be optimal. But I don’t see this as an insurmountable engineering problem. You should extend this to pre-implantation genetic diagnosis as well, take the zygote(s) with the lowest mutational load values and implant them. But that would be more controversial, due to the expense and the ethics.

I began thinking of this only a year or two back when I was going about starting a family, relatively late in life. Since I’m already “in the game,” and I can’t go back into the past to get my young sperm, I didn’t do this. And long term storage isn’t available in all locales. **But if you are a young man who lives in a large urban area and has a decent disposable income, why not?** Your symmetrical children with low mutational load will thank you for it.
