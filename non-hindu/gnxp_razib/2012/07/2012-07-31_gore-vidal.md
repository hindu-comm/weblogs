Gore Vidal

[Gore Vidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal) has died. As a younger man I found his heterodox views bracing, but I would commend to readers two books Vidal wrote which I feel often get forgotten in the shadow of his American historical novels, [Creation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375727051/geneexpressio-20) and [Julian](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/037572706X/geneexpressio-20). As a polemicist one must always view Vidal’s claims of fact with some suspicion (granted, I suspect I’m in more sympathy with some of his interpretations of history than most), but his historical fiction can rise above such a critique.
