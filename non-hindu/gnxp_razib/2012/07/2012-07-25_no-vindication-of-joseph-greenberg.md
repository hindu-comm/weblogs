No vindication of Joseph Greenberg?

A reader pointed me to this [critique](http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2012/07/20/newsflash-new-york-times-reports-90-year-old-consensus/) of Nick Wades’ telling in *The New York Times Reports* that the recent [Reich et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11258.html) paper on Native Americans is a vindication of [Joseph Greenberg’s ideas on the languages of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Greenberg#The_languages_of_the_Americas). [90-Year-Old Consensus](http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2012/07/20/newsflash-new-york-times-reports-90-year-old-consensus/):

First, when I first heard about Greenberg’s system in the late 1990s I chatted up a few people who were involved in the linguistics of Native Americans on the issue. They thought he was full of it, but, they were also pretty much opposed to imposing any real coarse structure on Native American languages, including the model which is claimed to be pretty well known above. My sample could be very unrepresentative. I’ll let readers who know more weigh in (note that I’m skeptical of classifying all the “First American” languages into one group after 15,000 years, even assuming they derive from a common ancestor).

On the other hand, the author caricatures the paper which he discusses by suggesting a “one-to-one correspondence.” In fact, the two non-First American groups are genetic, but not linguistic, hybrids. Additionally, the argument that cultural and genetic transmission differ is specious. Certainly it is true, but the two are also correlated due to the effect of culture and language on marriage networks. This seems common sense, but many social scientists in my experience seem to recoil from any disciplinary integration with genetics, and so totally distinguish the character of cultural heritability and genetic heritability.
