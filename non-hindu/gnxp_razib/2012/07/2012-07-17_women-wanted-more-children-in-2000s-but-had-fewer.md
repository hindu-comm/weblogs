Women wanted more children in 2000s, but had fewer

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/220px-Marissa_Mayer.jpg?resize=132%2C198)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/220px-Marissa_Mayer.jpg?resize=132%2C198)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/220px-Marissa_Mayer.jpg)As someone with mild concerns about [dysgenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgenics) (albeit, with a normative lens that high intelligence and good looks are *positive* heritable traits) trends, I’m quite heartened that [Marissa Mayer](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-yahoo-marissa-mayer-20120718,0,5425804.story) is pregnant. Of course she’s batting well below the average of [some of her sisters](http://www.npr.org/2012/07/11/155103593/to-beat-odds-poor-single-moms-need-wide-safety-net), but you take what you can get in the game of social statistics. Quality over quantitative thanks to [assortative mating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortative_mating).

This brings me to a follow up of my post from yesterday, [People wanted more children in 2000s, but had fewer](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/people-wanted-more-children-in-2000s-but-had-fewer). A reader [was curious](http://mikethemadbiologist.com/) about limiting the data set to females. Therefore, I did. The same general pattern seems to apply (the limitations/constraints were the same). The only thing I’ll note is that there were only \~40 women in the data set with graduate degrees in the 1970s who were also asked these particular questions, so take this with a grain of salt.

**Addendum:** Small sample sizes in the “graduate” educated pool.
That’s my explanation for the 1990s jump in ideal number of children.
