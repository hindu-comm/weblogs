[70 Students to Retake Exams After Cheating Case](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/nyregion/70-students-at-stuyvesant-to-retake-exams-after-cheating-case.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print):

> Seventy students were involved in a pattern of smartphone-enabled > cheating last month at Stuyvesant High School, New York City officials > said Monday, describing an episode that has blemished one of the > country’s most prestigious public schools. >
> The cheating involved several state exams and was uncovered after a > cellphone was confiscated from a 16-year-old junior during a citywide > language exam on June 18, according to a city Department of Education > investigation.

But the \$760 million figure gives a sense how > widespread the problem has become.
