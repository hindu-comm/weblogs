Genetics for the 21st century

[Rosie Redfield](http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/) has an opinion piece out in *PLoS Biology* on refashioning genetics education for the 21st century, [*“Why Do We Have to Learn This Stuff?”*—A New Genetics for 21st Century Students](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001356):

I believe the target audience here consists of undergraduate biology majors. If so, I agree the thrust of this piece.The average biology major will encounter a fair amount of genomics in their lives in the near future, at least filtered through medical professionals and such. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly for most, genomics is going to be a major avenue through which we explore biological pathways with medical relevance. The confusion over dominance rings trues.

But I wonder, does this not apply to those learning genetics at the graduate level? Genetic analysis in the abstract is useful, but when is the last time anyone did tetrad analysis that wasn’t working with [yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrad_(genetics))? In contrast, everyone probably has to develop some level of comfort with the general ins and outs of raw sequence analysis. All organisms have sequences, and many will be sequenced.

Anyone who knows me well knows that I’m not too interested in molecular genetics. **But I do think it is probably useful to start with the idea of the gene as a concrete biophysical entity, rather than as an abstract unit of inheritance.** Once you start with the concrete, you can work back to the abstract.
