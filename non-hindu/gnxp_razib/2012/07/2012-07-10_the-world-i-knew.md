The world I knew

There’s something about this 1995 single from Collective Soul, [The World I Know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_I_Know), which is redolent to me of the Pacific Northwest.\* Yes, it’s precious, but the Pacific Northwest *is* a bit precious. The land of misty mornings, [SWPLs](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/), and strong coffee. The shadows alternating with colorized high key lighting common in these alter-rock videos from the mid-90s does neatly parallel some of the scenery which you encounter in the geography of that region. It was only through happenstance that my family moved to the land of big trees when I was on the cusp of puberty, but it was where I matured as a person. Living outside the Northwest now I regularly identify as a Northwesterner, and I certainly miss some of the perks of that region, though I could do without the feeling that I’m walking around in a cloud forest scene in a fantasy novel all the time. ’till we see each other again, on [47th and Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumptown_Coffee_Roasters).

\* I am aware that CS is *not* a “Seattle band.”
