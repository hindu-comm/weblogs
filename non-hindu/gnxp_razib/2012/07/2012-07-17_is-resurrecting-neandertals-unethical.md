Is resurrecting Neandertals unethical?

An [interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/science/chris-stringer-on-the-origins-and-rise-of-modern-humans.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print) with paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer:

Now, at least theoretically, if someone had enough money, and I’d say stupidity, to do it, you could cut and paste those Denisovan mutations into a modern human genome, and then implant that into an egg and then grow a Denisovan. >

I do find it curious that Chris used the term “creatures.” This probably not intentional, or with serious conscious intent, but Neadertals and Denisovans are **creatures** I think the ethical issues are strongly mitigated. After all, chimpanzees are used in medical experiments. I assume that the woolly mammoth will be the first extinct complex organism which is resurrected. But what if they’re human???

Stalin purportedly [wished to create ape-human super-soldiers](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4219). What if it is true that Neandertals were, and would be, far stronger on a per unit basis than humans? Can you imagine: “*unleash the Neandertal brigade!*” More optimistically, what if Neandertals lacked social intelligence, but exhibited very strong aptitudes in the visuo-spatial sciences? Neandertals had average cranial capacities which were larger than modern humans.
