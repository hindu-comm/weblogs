A history of science blogging

Bora Zivkovic has what is basically a [short history of science blogging](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/2012/07/10/science-blogs-definition-and-a-history/) up. I was one of those who was there [at the beginning](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/reflections-on-10-years-in-science-blogging/), and I honestly can’t say that he left anything of great relevance out of the narrative. In normal circumstances I don’t think much about what I do, I do. But one thing I will add: **blogging isn’t some exotic and peculiar aspect of science anymore, many labs use WordPress as a content management system.** Blogs as they were 10 years ago aimed out, toward the populace. Today the info-ecological niches what we would have called blogs fill are much more diverse. Some blogs basically exist to update lab members and interested researchers on their publications and journal club. I add these to my RSS even though I’m not a member of the lab and don’t participate in the journal club because they’re educational to me (e.g., [gc bias](http://gcbias.org/)). Imagine, if you will, that R. A. Fisher had had a blog at [Rothamsted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothamsted_Experimental_Station). Though this is an opportunity to point you to the [R.A. Fisher Digital Archive](http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/3860) in case you don’t know about it. We live in rich times for the infovore.
