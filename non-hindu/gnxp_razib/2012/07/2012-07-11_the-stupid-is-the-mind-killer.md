The stupid is the mind-killer

In the comments below I expressed [anger](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/still-not-understanding-the-nature-of-affairs/#comment-141738) when I realized one of the readers who I had hoped was *not* stupid was really rather stupid. I don’t have a high toleration for this sort of stuff, which has supposedly become somewhat well known in the blogosphere (judging from comments about me on other weblogs). When I was younger I suspect I had more toleration for this sort of thing, and engaging with the dull is something that needs to be done, just like you need to change a baby’s diaper because you know they’ll soil themselves, and they can’t be left that way. Perhaps there’s a fixed amount of sympathy for people who shit themselves because they don’t know any better, literally or metaphorically. I’ve got to deal with the former right now, so maybe I’m not having any of the latter anymore.

  
Sometimes I wonder what world I’m living in, where rank stupidity can get passed along by newspapers as “letters to the editor.” For example, you have to read this whole piece from [Stephen Chauvin](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.chauvin), [State Board of Education is correct on evolution](http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/opinion/state-board-of-education-is-correct-on-evolution/article_3949bd46-5dbe-500c-8cd6-d44225adbbf6.html):

First, it would be funny if it wasn’t sad how often Creationists turn into street-corner philosophers of science and epistemologists. I’ve heard of the distinction between scientific laws and theories before, mostly with the former being something like thermodynamics, repeated observations, and the latter more a systematic body of knowledge which frames the data and generates inferences. **But these terms are in my experience in science not like the difference between baryons and leptons; they’re not clear and distinct.** Second, I emphasized sections where I basically didn’t know what he was talking about. That’s one of the maddening things about Creationists, they’ve created their whole internal language, which actually does a decent job seeming plausibly coherent to the non-scientifically trained. I think the emphasis on thinking for oneself is funny, because I’m 99% sure that this individual is rewarming talking points that he received in church. I suspect that the original points are often more scientifically coherent, if still false, but as they get passed around by people who don’t know what they’re saying they get more and more garbled. One of the main reasons I avoid talking to *blank slate* Leftists and Creationists is that often I notice I spend a lot of time refashioning the arguments they *want* to make for them, because they don’t even know what they are trying to say (if you want the Lefty equivalents, I almost always have to elaborate the exact nature of [Lewontin’s Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Human_genetic_diversity:_Lewontin's_fallacy%22_(scientific_paper)), because my interlocutors often garble it).

Anyway, I thought this letter was repeating because of the weird portion about antibiotics and viruses. They don’t really work on viruses, though most of the public seems to think they do. Why did this obvious show of ignorance go through? Did the people working at the paper not know? Or did they want to make Stephen Chauvin seem stupid?
