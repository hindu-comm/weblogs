Human version 2.001

[Dienekes reflects](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2012/07/redating-of-later-stone-age-brings-it.html) on the [seemingly simultaneous appearance](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/science/cave-findings-revive-debate-on-human-behavior.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print) of ****behavioral modernityin South Africa and Europe and Australia, pending the acceptance of the most recent finds. This part is very important in my opinion:****

> The San people still live in several countries of southern Africa, and > until the latter part of the 20th century were still mainly > hunter-gatherers. **But Dr. Stringer cautioned not to think of them as “living fossils,”** unchanged by time. “Their genes, cultures and behaviors have undoubtedly continued to evolve in the intervening millennia,” he said.

**I see no reason to think that these were the ancestors of the San.** Over 45,000 years I think the most likely option is that genetic and cultural continuity will **not** be maintained, and these are probably a sister group to the modern peoples of Southern Africa. In any case, to address Dienekes’ confusion, I think this is one case where his non-American background shows. **We know exactly what happened so long ago to kick-start modern humanity.** The answer has been with us for over 40 years.
