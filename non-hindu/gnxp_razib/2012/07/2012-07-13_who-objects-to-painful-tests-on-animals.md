Who objects to painful tests on animals?

In the year 2008 1,400 people were asked this question in the [GSS](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10):

> Scientists should be allowed to do research that causes pain and > injury to animals like dogs and chimpanzees if it produces new > information about human health problems. (Do you strongly agree, > agree, disagree, or strongly disagree?)

(variable ANSCITST)

I was curious because I ran into some stuff on pro-life sites today about how animal rights activist don’t oppose abortion, and how hypocritical that is. So naturally I was curious about how attitudes varied on that issue.

|                               |                                                |           |              |                       |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|
|                               | **Allow animal testing which might case pain** |           |              |                       |
|                               | **Strongly agree**                             | **Agree** | **Disagree** | **Strongly Disagree** |
| **Yes to abortion on demand** | 8                                              | 31        | 39           | 22                    |
| **No to abortion on demand**  | 7                                              | 32        | 39           | 23                    |

**What the results above show is that **there is almost no difference in attitudes toward animal research when you vary attitudes toward abortion on demand.**** In other words, 22 percent of pro-choice people oppose such research strongly, while 23 percent of pro-life people do. How does this vary by demographic?
