The expanding crest of modern humanity

If you are interested in genomics and human evolution, a new review paper in *PLoS Genetics* is a must read, [Genomic Data Reveal a Complex Making of Humans](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002837?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosgenetics%2FNewArticles+%28Ambra+-+Genetics+New+Articles%29). A must read not because you need to agree with the thrust of the authors’ arguments, but because it provides a thorough bibliography for the last 2 to 3 years. Here is the abstract:

> In the last few years, two paradigms underlying human evolution have > crumbled. Modern humans have not totally replaced previous hominins > without any admixture, and the expected signatures of adaptations to > new environments are surprisingly lacking at the genomic level. Here > we review current evidence about archaic admixture and lack of strong > selective sweeps in humans. We underline the need to properly model > differential admixture in various populations to correctly reconstruct > past demography. We also stress the importance of taking into account > the spatial dimension of human evolution, **which proceeded by a > series of range expansions that could have promoted both the > introgression of archaic genes and background selection.**

The main problem I have at this point is the general mode of range expansions, whereby population A expands as a demographic wave across a substrate of population B. These sorts of models seem to assume a sort of continuous dynamic process. In contrast, **I am beginning to suspect that much of the human demographic past was characterized by discrete events.** The closer to the present the more I’m convinced of this, though honestly I am now pushing back my own timing for the origins of many of the human distinctive traits, such as culture, well before behaviorally modern humans.
