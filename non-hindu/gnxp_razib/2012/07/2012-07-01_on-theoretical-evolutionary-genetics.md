On theoretical evolutionary genetics

Many of the books [I recommended below are rather expensive](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/07/learning-population-and-evolutionary-genetics/). [Theoretical Evolutionary Genetics](http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/pgbook/pgbook.pdf) (PDF) is not. Unfortunately much of the discourse of contemporary science is beyond the financial means of much of the world’s population, whether it be in university press textbooks or gated journals. **So I’m quite happy in putting up a link to this text-in-progress.**
