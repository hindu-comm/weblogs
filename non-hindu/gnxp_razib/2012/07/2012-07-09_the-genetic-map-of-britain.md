The genetic map of Britain

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/map1.jpg?resize=348%2C554)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/map1.jpg?resize=348%2C554)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/07/map1.jpg)**Update:** A commenter noted that North England and Southwest Wales have different shape points. This is clear in the original PDF when I increased resolution. So ignore my comment about Brythonic Celtcs.

**End Update**

A few weeks ago I heard about the project to create a genetic map of Britain. Actually, I knew a bit about this because they’ve been publishing a few papers here and there over the years. But there is now an [an exhibit up](http://sse.royalsociety.org/2012/exhibits/genetic-maps/) at *The Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2012*. My attention was drawn to this because British tabloids kept pushing headlines like “Cornish genetically different from other English!” I emailed one of the scientists associated with the project, Peter Donnelly, but he never got back to me. So I figured I would post anyway. Looks like they’re using thousands of samples at 600,000 SNPs. When they get a paper out it should be neat. On the other hand the map leaves a little to be desired. The clusters are clear, **but what’s the genetic distance between the clusters in a relative sense?** How were the cut-offs devised? I’m sure there are reasonable answers, but it’s all rather opaque at this point.

Nevertheless, I do want to point out two things. First, [Anglo-Saxon England](http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/7/72/Britain_802.jpg/250px-Britain_802.jpg) rather jumps out at you does it not? Second, **the similarity between southwest Wales and northern England is explicable.** The northern English region was associated with the Brythonic Celtic kingdom of [Rheged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheged), and later the southern portion of historical [Strathclyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde). These were the cousins of the Welsh, not Gaels like the Scots, but Britons. This is evident in the name [Cumbria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheged#End_of_Rheged), it has the same root as [Cymry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people), the ethnonym of the Welsh for themselves.
