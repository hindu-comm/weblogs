Education encourages integration?

It is sometimes fashionable to assert that higher socioeconomic status whites are the sort who will impose integration on lower socioeconomic status whites, all the while sequestering themselves away. I assumed this was a rough reflection of reality. But after looking at the [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) I am not sure that this chestnut of cynical wisdom has a basis in fact. Below are the proportions of non-Hispanic whites who have had a black friend or acquaintance over for dinner recently by educational attainment:

35% – Less than high school  
36% – High school  
47% – Junior College  
45% – Bachelor  
59% – Graduate

I thought this might have been a fluke, so I played around with the GSS’s multiple regression feature, using a [logistic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). **To my surprise socioeconomic status was positively associated with having a black person over for dinner, and age negatively associated.** These two variables in fact tended to exhibit equal magnitude values in opposition, and always remained statistically significant. Just to clear, I created a variable Non-South vs. South below (being Southern increases likelihood of having had a black person over for dinner). All the individuals surveyed are non-Hispanic whites for the year 2000 and later. You can add and remove variables, but SEI and age tend to be rather stable, and statistically significant, throughout.

(of course, this could just be a case where some demographics lie more than others)
