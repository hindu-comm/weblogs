The American Community Survey: mend it, don't end it!

To my surprise there is apparently a move on the part of the [Republicans in the House of Representatives](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/20/census-surveys-arent-down-for-the-count/) to curtail funding for [The American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey). I am not too excited by the idea that you could get fined for not filling out a government survey form, but neither do I think that abolishing social statistics is the correct solution to this problem. **Rather, better surveys which compensate for biases in response rates are the direction we need to go.** The reality is that a government of our scope and continuing responsibilities needs the best social statistics that money can buy. I understand that many believe that some of the functions of our government are illegitimate or unwarranted, but destroying the governmentâ€™s general ability to function is counter-productive unless you want to total social collapse to trigger a revolution.

Second, **government data collection is a public good with [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive)**[. If we abolish endeavors such as the American Community Survey than social data will be the domain only of corporations,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive) [who are not always keen on sharing that data](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/science/big-data-troves-stay-forbidden-to-social-scientists.html?_r=2&ref=science&pagewanted=print).
