Richard Dawkins accepts the usefulness of race

There have been a variety of responses to my column in [The Crux](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/05/02/human-races-may-have-biological-meaning-but-races-mean-nothing-about-humanity/) on [race](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/05/02/human-races-may-have-biological-meaning-but-races-mean-nothing-about-humanity/). To be fair, because the audience for *The Crux* does not consist of genome nerds I engaged in some first approximations which some readers have taken objection to. For example, the genetic architecture of blue vs. brown eye inheritance is ‘quasi-Mendelian,’ with \~75 percent of the variation in Europeans on this trait attributable to variation in the region of the *HERC2* and *OCA2* genes. But I thought, and still think, that a rough re-characterization of the trait as a recessive one with a monogenic Mendelian inheritance pattern can be justified for didactic purposes (just like one can justify the idea that whole human genomes have been sequenced, even if there are large gaps, and known errors in regions of repeats).

But the comments over at Richard Dawkins’ [website](http://richarddawkins.net/articles/645824-human-races-may-have-biological-meaning-but-races-mean-nothing-about-humanity/) have been rather amusing as a whole. Some people were [patronizingly pedantic](http://richarddawkins.net/comments/939582), and I don’t have time respond in detail (the real response would be: **read my blog!**). But some [comments are easy to answer](http://richarddawkins.net/comments/939491):

> I’d like to hear Dawkins’ response to this, I’ve read all of his books > and he’d surely disagree with the author of that article.

Easy. He discusses race in [The Ancestors’ Tale](https://books.google.com/books?id=rR9XPnaqvCMC&lpg=PA51&dq=ancestor's%20tale%20edwards%20dawkins&pg=PA406#v=onepage&q&f=false) (a book the commenter claims to have read):

> The African, who was the only black person there – and he really was > black, unlike many “African-Americans” – happened to be wearing a red > tie. He finished his self-introduction by laughingly saying, “You can > easily remember me. I am the one with the red tie.” He was genially > mocking the way people bend over backwards to pretend not to notice > racial differences.

One minor point: I did not notice in the original reading of this passage that Richard Dawkins comes out against what we in the USA would term [affirmative action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_employment_equality_law#Positive_action)!
