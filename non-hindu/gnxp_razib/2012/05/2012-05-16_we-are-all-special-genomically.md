We are all special (genomically)

[John Hawks](http://johnhawks.net/node/28776) already discussed the Keinan and Clark paper in *Science*, [Recent Explosive Human Population Growth Has Resulted in an Excess of Rare Genetic Variants](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6082/740). To borrow a critique, much of human genomics up to this point has been [WEIRD](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&ved=0CGgQFjAG&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.scientificamerican.com%2Fprimate-diaries%2F2011%2F12%2F07%2Fthe-weird-evolution-of-human-psychology%2F&ei=upq0T5CLE4GViAKv3PmNAg&usg=AFQjCNF7ElBJpeFHVc3CfMcFAKh07MZMbQ&sig2=pkO3NAMzyRZNt1EUKv25FQ). A reanalysis of the same finite population sets, over and over. No longer. Soon thousands upon thousands of whole genomes will come online, and innumerable rare alleles will start filling the background in. The ultimate end point of this will be when whole families have 100X coverage, and a set of unique mutational variants to each individual within the family unit will become known.
