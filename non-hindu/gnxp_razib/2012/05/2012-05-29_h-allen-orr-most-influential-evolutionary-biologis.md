H. Allen Orr, most influential evolutionary biologist of all time?

A reader reminded me of an amusing paper, [Who Likes Evolution? Dissociation Of Human Evolution Versus Evolutionary Psychology](http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2011/05/are-creationists-more-receptive-to-evolutionary-psychology-2/). The gist of the results are below (I added some clarification):

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/evo.jpg?resize=599%2C440)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/evo.jpg?resize=599%2C440)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/05/evo.jpg)

  
The propositions to gauge acceptance of evolutionary psychology revolve around sex differences. One can argue whether this is an appropriate measure, but to a first approximation I think it gets to the heart of the matter. There are deep evolutionary genetic (number and size of [gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete)) and [anatomical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism#Humans) to assume that sex differences in behavior are ***not*** exclusively a function of cultural variation. One can argue about the details of the inferences that evolutionary psychology makes (I think it is subject to the [problems rife in psychology as a whole](http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634)), but I don’t think its ultimate underpinning in sociobiology is crazy.

Nevertheless, I do think there are some empirical results which are robust enough across a range of studies and observations that we move from theoretical likelihood to concrete assessment of the probability of a particular sex difference. For example, **the idea that males *on average* all things equal tend to exhibit more aggression than females.** To me this seems to be very low hanging fruit among the range of hypotheses. And yet [many people are not willing to admit this](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/05/porn-a-new-age-an-old-age-and-all-that/#comment-136492). This is where I throw my hands up in the air. The fact is that my friends’ protests to the contrary the problems with evolutionary psychology as it is today tend to engender [sneering](http://crookedtimber.org/2004/04/07/lucus-a-non-lucendo/), more than attempts to rectify the situation and produce a real inter-disciplinary science of humanity.

Which brings me to H. Allen Orr. Within evolution Orr is probably most well known for a body of work which culminated in his book co-authored with Jerry Coyne, [Speciation](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878930892/geneexpressio-20). But for those outside of evolution Orr is probably more well known for his writings in *The Boston Review* and *The New York Review of Books*. In these venues he has engaged in broadsides against Intelligent Design, the “New Atheism,” and, [evolutionary psychology](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2003/feb/27/darwinian-storytelling/?pagination=false). I assume from the results above that those who accept evolution but reject evolutionary psychology do so because they have read H. Allen Orr, a practitioner of the evolutionary arts himself, and understand on intellectual grounds biology can not tell us much about human affairs.

**Note:** For a core cadre of literal readers: the title is sarcasm.
