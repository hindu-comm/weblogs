Genes are overrated, genetics is underrated

A few days ago [Nathaniel Comfort](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/histmed/people/faculty/comfort.html) pointed me to this post, [Genetic determinism round-up](http://genotopia.scienceblog.com/151/genetic-determinism-round-up/). If you are curious go read Comfort’s whole post. I honestly didn’t enjoy it very much, I think I got what he was saying, but there were all sorts of circumlocutions around the overall message. But I agree one one thing in particular: **an emphasis on concrete and specific genes for traits is a motif in science journalism that can be very frustrating, and often misleading.** Nevertheless, that’s not the only story. **I believe our current culture greatly underestimates the power of genetics in shaping broader social patterns.**

How can these be reconciled? Do not genes and genetics go together? The resolution is a simple one: when you speak of 1,000 genes, you speak of no genes. You can’t list 1,000 genes in prose, even if you know them. But using standard quantitative and behavior genetic means one can apportion variation in the population of a trait to variation in genes. 1,000 genes added together can be of great effect. **The newest findings in genomics are reinforcing assertions of non-trivial heritability of many complex traits, though rendering problematic attributing that heritability to a specific set of genes.**

  
So how do we underestimate genes? Consider this story in *The New York Times Magazine*, [Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/can-you-call-a-9-year-old-a-psychopath.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&pagewanted=print):

Or we worry about other people not liking us. Or we worry about getting caught. When you start to take away those inhibitors, I think that’s when you end up with psychopathy.”

I have already expressed my lack of awareness on these issues because of how much I trust the understanding of psychologists of any given [endophenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophenotype) aside from IQ. But let’s say they understand the trait of pscyhoopathy. And let’s take the 80 percent heritability seriously. What does this mean? I’ve rehashed heritability and such 1,000 times on this blog, so let’s go visual with few words. Imagine a scenario where a person who is 2 standard deviations above the norm in psychopathy marries someone who is 1 standard deviation above the norm (roughly, top 2% and top 15%). Assortative mating is common, so this isn’t an out of the ordinary conjecture. Below are the distributions of outcomes of the offspring of these two individuals compared to the general population.

Very few people in our society think in these terms. Rather, [very well educated and rich people are spending \$30,000](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204603004577271432291154436.html) per year on gaining the admission of their 1 year old child to a preschool for toddlers! Unless elite university admission is somehow tied in to this initial admission decision, *in utero*, I assume these parents are wasting their money, and I’ve wondered how to get some of it myself, as some people are obviously easily parted given moral panic. But their children are not getting a \$30,000 “enriched” environment. Environment can only do so much.

So here are two bullet points to repeat:

**– For behavior genes don’t matter, genetics does**

**– When you remove environmental variation, all you have left is genetic variation**

Internalizing this reality allows for some “quick & dirty” social science approximations.
