Peer of myself

[Dr. Joe Pickrell](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/08/the-first-steps-towards-a-modern-system-of-scientific-publication.php) has [a follow up](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/08/the-first-steps-towards-a-modern-system-of-scientific-publication.php) to his [widely discussed](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) post on updating scientific publication for the 21st century. **One section jumped out at me, not because it was revolutionary, but because it made explicit a complaint that I had often heard:**

> The solution to this problem relies on a simple observation–**in my > field, I am completely indifferent to whether a paper has been > “peer-reviewed” for the basic reason that I consider myself a > “peer”**. I do not think it extremely hubristic to say that I am > reasonably capable of evaluating whether a paper in my field is worth > reading, and then if so, of judging its merits. The opinions of other > people in the field are of course important, but in no way does the > fact that two or three nameless people thought a paper worth > publishing influence my opinion of it. This immediately suggests a > system in which papers are posted online as soon as the authors think they are ready (on so-called pre-print servers). This system is the default in many physics, math, and economics communities, among others, and as far as I can tell it’s been quite successful.

The reality is that often the “peers” are not peers. How else to explain the publication of the [longevity study](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110721/full/news.2011.429.html) in *Science*, now retracted? Or the [non-canonical RNA editing](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/03/questioning-the-evidence-for-non-canonical-rna-editing-in-humans.php)? (presumably this is less common of a problem in specialized journals). And sometimes the feedback of peers can indicate that they don’t really know what they’re talking about. For example, I was once told that the authors of a phylogenetics paper which used Bayesian methods were asked to reanalyze their data with a max likelihood framework (jump to the last sentence of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood#Principles) to see why this is peculiar).

The *theory*of classical peer review made sense in the pre-internet age. But now there are a plenty of reasons why we might need to revisit this.\*

\* Not to mention that “peer review” is a somewhat subjective concept. Richard A. Muller has gotten into a back & forth on this issue whether his latest work has undergone peer review. He claims it has, others claim not. I suspect most traditional biologists would be skeptical of Muller’s claim, but physicists would accept it.
