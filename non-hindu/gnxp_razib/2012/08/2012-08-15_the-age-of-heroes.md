The Age of Heroes

Sometimes when you read reviews or papers **you need to look very closely at what people say in a tentative speculative fashion.** That’s because though the prose may be as such when read plainly and without context, you often have more prior information as to the background of the authors. In other words, assertions which literally seem cautious are actually foreshadowing likely probabilities down the pipeline, because the authors are not distant third-party observers, but active participants in the production of new insights. I think that’s what’s going on in a new paper in *Trends in Genetics*, [The genetic history of Europeans](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952512000959):

> Future research should also reveal the effects of **post-Neolithic > demographic processes, including migration events, which preliminary > data suggest had a major impact upon the distribution of genetic > variation. These include events associated with *Bronze Age > civilizations, Iron Age cultures, and later migrations,* including > those triggered by the rise and fall of Empires.** Challenges remain > in being able to sequence aDNA routinely from serial samples in the > range of megabases, and in the development of software that allows > spatially-explicit simulation of genome-scale data, but advances in these areas are now a weekly occurrence and the stage is set for a rapid increase in our knowledge on the evolutionary history of AMH in Europe.

I’d have said this was crazy a few years ago. No longer.
