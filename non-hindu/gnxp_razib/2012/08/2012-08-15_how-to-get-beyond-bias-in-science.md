How to get beyond bias in science?

Here’s a [comment which is interesting](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/open-thread-8152012/#comment-153190), if hard to actually engage with because of the difficulty of the subject matter:

First, as I keep telling my liberal readers and friends **there’s a deep denialism about sex differences that is ideologically motivated on the Left.** For me the most obvious illustration of this is when people on the Left are quite happy to talk about sex differences. Here’s a [very long article in*The Guardian*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/19/neuroeconomics-women-city-financial-crash), [Testosterone and high finance do not mix: *so bring on the women Gender inequality has been an issue in the City for years, but now the new science of ‘neuroeconomics’ is proving the point beyond doubt: hormonally-driven young men should not be left alone in charge of our finances….*](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/19/neuroeconomics-women-city-financial-crash)This was triggered by Michael Lewis’ speculation about the [roots of the financial crisis in Iceland](http://www.rightwingnews.com/uncategorized/iceland-and-wall-streets-demise-its-the-testosterone/). To my knowledge Lewis did not get tarred and feathered as an ‘essentialist.’ But that’s because he followed Althouse’ rule: make sure your model of sex differences portrays males in an unflattering light.

But I don’t want to talk about racism and sexism in science. Rather, scientists tend to be [liberal](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/02/18/why-are-scientists-so-often-liberal-in-political-outlook/) and [atheist](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html). **How can the American public, a plural majority of whom are religious and conservative, trust the findings of a profession which is odds with them on matters of politics and God**? Well, what’s the alternative. Do you want to go with faith healers and Flood geologists? Scientists are human, and science is a human enterprise, but as a culture and method toward understanding the world it’s about as good as you get in this world. Mind you, that’s a really low bar, but science gave us antibiotics and men on the moon. Not too shabby. By their fruit you will recognize them.
