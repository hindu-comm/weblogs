Evolutionary & population genetics preprints – Haldane’s Sieve

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/coop.png?resize=514%2C117)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/coop.png?resize=514%2C117)](https://twitter.com/Graham_Coop/status/240516399309668352)

OK, perhaps I can help with that. Dr. Coop speaks of the collaboration between himself & Dr. Joseph Pickrell, [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/), which I added to my RSS days ago (and you can see me pushing it to my [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:gnxp)). From the [“About”](http://haldanessieve.org/about/):

> As described above, most posts to Haldane’s Sieve will be basic > descriptions of relevant preprints, with little to no commentary. All > posts will have comment sections where discussion of the papers will > be welcome. A second type of post will be detailed comments on a > preprint of particular interest to a contributor. These posts could > take the style of a journal review, or may simply be some brief > comments. We hope they will provide useful feedback to the authors of > the preprint. Finally, there will be posts by authors of preprints in > which they describe their work and place it in broader context. >
> We ask the commenters to remember that by submitting articles to > preprint servers the authors (often biologists) are taking a somewhat > unusual step. Therefore, comments should be phrased in a constructive > manner to aid the authors.

It might be helpful if other [evolution/genetics bloggers](http://johnhawks.net/) reblog this so we can push it up the [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=haldane's+sieve) results. If you google “Haldane’s Sieve” some of the results are interesting…and not necessarily in a good way. I do feel guilt blogging on stuff my readers can’t get, so the more preprints become acceptable the more we (as in, the general public) can understand about evolution.
