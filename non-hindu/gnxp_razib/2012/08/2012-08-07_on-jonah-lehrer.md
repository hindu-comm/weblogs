On Jonah Lehrer

Since Jonah Lehrer came up in the [open thread](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/open-thread-812012/) last week, I’m going to mention it. First, I’ll preface this by saying that my interactions with Jonah, who I labeled the “boy king of cognitive neuroscience” jokingly at one point, were all positive. Since Jonah quoted me in *The Wall Street Journal* I received an email from a fact-checker asking me about this. He didn’t misquote me, and on the contrary, he was punctilious about correcting a misspelling of my name. I liked what I knew about Jonah as a person, and the whole episode has left me rather depressed.

Plagiarism, fabulism, whatever you call it, what he did was horrible. But what really sent me over the edge was [the possibility that Jonah threw an editor under the bus](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pyramids-meaning/201208/jonah-lehrer-charmed-me-then-blatantly-lied-me-about-science), casting blame elsewhere to cover up his sloppiness. The main reason I post this is that I want to reproduce [a comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/open-thread-812012/#comment-148595) which illustrates the sort of error Jonah regularly made:

This sounds familiar. In 2006 the blogger behind [Mixing Memory](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/), Chris, kept telling me that Jonah simply did not know what he was talking about in the details. This area of cognitive neuroscience was one where I didn’t know enough to judge (though I did know enough to know that Chris’ critiques of Jonah’s representation of Freud were accurate). But after all, Jonah was a Rhodes Scholar who also studied neuroscience at Columbia. How could he **not** know! Meanwhile, Chris was also very knowledgeable in his domain. But what about evolution? [RPM](http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2007/05/03/jonah-lehrer-doesnt-understand/) of Evolgen also noticed some problems with Jonah’s handling of the details of science.

So the warning signs were there if you chose to look. I didn’t look. Jonah was nice, and had an impressive pedigree. It was enough that I ignored very compelling criticisms from people who I trusted. Perhaps it is a time to reflect on how we decide who we trust.
