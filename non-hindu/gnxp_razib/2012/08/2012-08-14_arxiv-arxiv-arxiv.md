arXiv! arXiv! arXiv!

Over the [Nielsen Group](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/) [blog](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/blog/), [Time to jump into the arXiv?](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/2012/time-to-jump-into-the-arxiv/):

It doesn’t matter to me at this point that people might have qualms. **Once sufficient consciousness is raised and critical mass is achieved, then you’ll see a stampede.** Some fields in biology may be late into the shift toward preprint distribution, but for the purposes of a lot of the stuff I cover on this weblog I doubt that will matter. When it comes to evolutionary biology that isn’t being funded by pharma or private foundations I don’t think there’s much holding people back aside from the worry about being scooped.

I don’t know much about academia and its intrigues personally, but I have heard of instances of reviewers squatting on a paper until someone else associated with the reviewer publishes (yes, people know who is reviewing in many cases, or suspects). This is a form of scooping, but it occurs in the shadows, and there’s always deniability. Who knows how we can quantify this sort of behavior? But it’s something to that we need to keep in mind when we’re worried about the pitfalls of open access and preprint distribution.
