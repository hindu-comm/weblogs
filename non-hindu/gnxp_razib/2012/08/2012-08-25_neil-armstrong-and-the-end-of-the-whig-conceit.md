Neil Armstrong and the end of the Whig conceit

It has been 40 years since he last human being set foot on the moon. I was not alive when this occurred. The [Whig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history) views history as a progression. When we recall the past we remember, perhaps pity, a less developed age.

Overall I disagree with declinists who simplistically portray our age as one of silver, that perhaps we live in the modern Western equivalent of late antique Rome. Certainly there is greatness all around us. And one can argue that the “space race” was driven not by ennobling sentiments, but rather the raw competition between the United States and Soviet Union. Be as that may be, **could we soon look back to the 1960s as the ultimate high point in the spirit of the West?** Perhaps we do live in a fallen age in a sense, unable to rouse ourselves and recapture past glories, and even surpass them. The Hellenistic Greeks were a civilized people, who were more advanced than their Classical predecessors in particular details of science and engineering. **Yet most scholars would suggest that there was something derivative and unoriginal when compared to the ferment of Athens’ golden century.**

I wonder. Did Neil Armstrong ever consider when he set foot on the moon that humanity would not return for the last four decades of his life?
