The cheating of the chosen

**Update:** [Harvard Students in Cheating Scandal Say Collaboration Was Accepted](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/education/students-of-harvard-cheating-scandal-say-group-work-was-accepted.html?adxnnl=1&partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print&adxnnlx=1346479658-+nj9TRO0ag+YKe/tPRfBDw).

[Harvard Says 125 Students May Have Cheated on a Final Exam](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/education/harvard-says-125-students-may-have-cheated-on-exam.html):

Anyone have opinions on this? I know plenty of readers are in the local area in various capacities. My working assumption is that these kids will get off with a slap on the wrist. The meritocracy does not eat its own young. With such widespread cheating in this course this not a matter of intellectual incompetents, but very smart kids who simply wanted to push their advantages on the margin. This is the university that was sending half its graduates to investment banks a few years ago, so what’s new?

Seeing the workings of the hyper-elite probably turn the average person in two directions. If they lean Right, it’s guns & gold. If they lean Left, some sort of Red revolutionary urge. There’s a reason history goes in cycles….
