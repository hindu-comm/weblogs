Consent and genomics

Interesting story in *The New York Times*, [Genes Now Tell Doctors Secrets They Can’t Utter](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/health/research/with-rise-of-gene-sequencing-ethical-puzzles.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=print):

> One of the first cases came a decade ago, just as the new age of > genetics was beginning. A young woman with a strong family history of > breast and ovarian cancer enrolled in a study trying to find cancer > genes that, when mutated, greatly increase the risk of breast cancer. > But the woman, terrified by her family history, **also intended to > have her breasts removed prophylactically.** >
> Her consent form said she would not be contacted by the researchers. > Consent forms are typically written this way because the purpose of > such studies is not to provide medical care but to gain new insights. > The researchers are not the patients’ doctors. >

One reason that I encourage people to be more open about their genomic results **is that by and large I feel most people have only an upside in terms of information content.** I’m pretty sure that we’ll “be there” in terms of transparency in \~10 years in any case, so I don’t see much gain in excessive fixation on privacy in the short term. That being said, a lot of these issues emerge because of older studies, which did not anticipate more powerful modern analytic methods. How you can write a specific consent form for future contingencies? That’s just hard.

And ultimately as highlighted in the article **researchers have a finite amount of time, energy, and reputation, which they can allocate and risk.** The last because one wonders about the legal hazards that someone is opening themselves up to even if they think they are doing the “right thing.” Anonymous participants who are never told about their risks (or, whose relatives are never told because they have died) are probably unlikely to ever sue based on inaction. On the other hand, if you open up a can of worms with the best of intentions you might be taking a risk in terms of liability and what not. Individual researchers can’t change the status quo. Institutions have to take charge and balance the various values which they hold dear.
