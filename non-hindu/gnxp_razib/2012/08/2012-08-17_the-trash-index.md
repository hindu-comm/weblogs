The trash index

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/garbagechart.png?resize=577%2C385)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/garbagechart.png?resize=577%2C385)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/garbagechart.png)

I heard about the chart above on [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/tracking-economy-and-gdp-through-trash). Track enough variables, and you’ll find some which correlate well with GDP…until they don’t. So this is a neat story, but is it true? Well, **I do accept the underlying logic here.** So I’m hoping this is a statistical artifact of some sort….
