Biology discovers arXiv (sort of)

Last year when Dr. Joseph Pickrell posted [Why publish science in peer-reviewed journals?](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) at [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/07/why-publish-science-in-peer-reviewed-journals.php) **many of the responses naturally turned to criticism of such a system which overturned the conventions of publication in biology.** The critiques were fair enough, but my own confusion and irritation was with the fact that many seemed to pretend, or not know, about [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/). It is perhaps true that biological sciences are different in some fundamental ways from physics, or even social sciences which put preprints up at [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/). But it seems that any objection to the revolution in scientific production and dissemination which Dr. Pickrell proposed should at least grapple with the fact that physics, mathematics, computer science, economics, etc. continue to remain viable academic fields despite the fact that preprints circulate widely among scholars, and even to the general public.\* Publication in a paper in these fields is often an after the fact stamp of approval, depending on the reception from the community of peers.

  
Though Dr. Pickrell’s dream has not come true as of yet, it is nice to see that he and other bold individuals are making a push to make arXiv more widely used within biology through their own examples. *Nature* has a nice [write-up](http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-eye-the-potential-of-arxiv-1.11091):

> Another attention-grabbing submission by prominent geneticists, posted > on 23July, compares genomic variation in 22 African populations to > suggest an ancient genetic link between people in southern and eastern > Africa…One of the paper’s senior authors, geneticist David Reich of > Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, publishes routinely > in*Nature*and the*Public Library of Science*journals, and > co-author Carlos Bustamante, of Stanford University School of Medicine > in California, is a leader in the field. Reich says that first author > Joseph Pickrell, also at Harvard Medical School, suggested using > arXiv. Reich and the other co-authors saw no good reason not to post the manuscript there. “**It could be an example of the younger generation coming in and finding this sort of thing natural**,” says Ginsparg.

How fast generations fly. Neither David Reich nor Carlos Bustamante are particularly old. A few years ago you’d see quant bio papers on arXiv which were destined for *The Journal of Theoretical Biology*. It’s heartening to now see papers whose ultimate destinations are likely to be more mainstream journals now being put there.

\* Many popular stories drawn from economics’ “papers” are actually preprints, which you can go find on the author’s website or some other repository.
