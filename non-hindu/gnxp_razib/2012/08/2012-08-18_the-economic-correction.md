The economic correction

Finally the [social bubble](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/business/Sites-Like-Groupon-and-Facebook-Disappoint-Investors.html?pagewanted=all&pagewanted=print) seems to be bursting. Do remember that in 2000 there was backlash against Amazon as well, and it’s still around. Still,[global oil demand level](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/08/chart-day-low-global-demand-oil-probably-points-sluggish-global-economy)is low. Most people seem to agree that some of the “fixes” to the 2008 financial crisis were only band-aids, and the fundamental structural problems were put off for another day. Is that day now? Pessimism is cheap, but if you feel it, why not share it? I mused about a [possible recession in May of 2007](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2007/05/recession/), and some of the comments were kind of funny and tragic. I’ll quote, with names removed to protect the guilty:

> They’re practically glorified hiccups nowadays. I don’t get what the > big deal is. >
> … >
> In a word, no. Unless you’re talking houses here in the Bay Area, but > the “recession” is more like a return to a normal, vanilla market. All > the economic signs I see look good. Krugman’s cat must be hurting. >
> … >
> The economy has been generally good, unemployment has been relatively > low throughout. And so no, I don’t see the looming failure > ecomomically. >
> … >
> I doubt it. People often react to one aspect of the economy without > looking at the larger picture. Yes, there was an overextension of sub > prime lending, but those are only a fraction of mortgages.  
> Other fundamentals are still very strong, and the yield on equities > (earnings divided by price) is often less than the after tax cost of > money (about two thirds the long term interest rate to borrow). I > think a recession is extremely unlikely when stocks are so cheap > compared to money and smart companies are using their cash to buy back > in their own shares and acquire other companies. >
> … >
> I don’t get the impression of any looming recession, though I have > read people predicting one over a year. >
> … >

> “They’ve been saying the same thing for a year now, as housing has > fallen off a cliff. But it just never comes true. There’s simply no > evidence of infection of 95% of the economy by the 5% represented by > housing.  
> “Income is strong. Spending is strong. Jobs are strong. Corporate > earnings are strong. Everything is strong but housing.” >

> The U.S. Equity markets have been hitting all time highs, and > valuations aren’t egregiously out of whack like they were back in > 1999/2000. U.S. Corporations have posted double digit quarterly profit > increases for at least 12 straight quarters, and are now sitting on > boatloads of cash. Unemployment is at a reasonable level. I think at > worst we’re going to see a \*correction\*, but not a depression. In > addition, Alan’s doomsday prophesying aside, China has been posting > nearly double digit \*GDP\* growth for the past 25 years (see here). > Think about it: it’s unheard of for corporations to accomplish this, > let alone an entire country. China may suffer the slings and arrows > that come with grander economic cycles, but predicting its collapse > is, I think, a bit misguided. And, as for Russia, Alan’s population > numbers are 1) incorrect and 2) not taking into account the loss of > population due to the breakup of the Soviet Union. Also, population > loss does not equate with a deteriorating economy. That’s just > Malthusian wrongheadedness.
