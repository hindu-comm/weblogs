Rise of the planet of the Indo-Europeans

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/indoe.jpg?resize=513%2C514)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/indoe.jpg?resize=513%2C514)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/indoe.jpg)

In response to [my post below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/the-age-of-heroes/) a friend emailed me the above sentence. As I suggest below it sounds crazy, and I don’t know if I believe it. But here’s an [abstract](http://www.harappadna.org/2012/06/ani-asi-admixture-dating/) from the [Reich lab](http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/Reich_Lab/Welcome.html) from June:

> **Estimating a date of mixture of ancestral South Asian populations** >
> Linguistic and genetic studies have demonstrated that almost all > groups in South Asia today descend from a mixture of two highly > divergent populations: Ancestral North Indians (ANI) related to > Central Asians, Middle Easterners and Europeans, and Ancestral South > Indians (ASI) not related to any populations outside the Indian > subcontinent. ANI and ASI have been estimated to have diverged from a > common ancestor as much as 60,000 years ago, but the date of the > ANI-ASI mixture is unknown. **Here we analyze data from about 60 South > Asian groups to estimate that major ANI-ASI mixture occurred > 1,200-4,000 years ago**.Some mixture may also be older—beyond the > time we can query using admixture linkage disequilibrium—since it is > universal throughout the subcontinent: present in every group speaking > Indo-European or Dravidian languages, in all caste levels, and in primitive tribes. After the ANI-ASI mixture that occurred within the last four thousand years, a cultural shift led to widespread endogamy, decreasing the rate of additional mixture.

  
The most likely candidate population for an admixture event in the Indian subcontinent within such a time frame are [Indo-Aryans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_peoples). But, it does make some sense in light of the fact that the Northwest Eurasian variant of the lactase persistence allele is [found in India](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/the-gift-of-the-gopi/), as that is presumably a relatively new variant. Let’s assume that in fact Indo-Aryans did arrive in India within this time frame, and were demographically numerous enough that they left a population genetic stamp. **What is the probability that they *did not* do the same in Europe?** I’d say that’s low. In other words, if the above results are correct, that Indo-Aryans had a significant impact on already heavily populated South Asia, then it stands to reason that the same would be true for Europe. Why hasn’t this signal been as easily detected? I Assume it’s because the Indo-Europeans were genetically closer to non-Indo-European Europeans in the first place.

This sort of phenomenon may explain [the recent divergence between Tibetans and Chinese](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2010/07/why-tibetans-breath-so-easy-up-high/). Linguistically the two populations are very different, and it is hard to credit that Tibetan and Chinese dialects diverged within the last \~3,000 years. But it makes much more sense if the Han demographic radiation was from a set of genetically similar, but culturally diverse, populations. Though gene flow maintained a degree of coherency, it may be that there were deep linguistic fissures across the North China plain before the rise of the Han. Similarly, the peoples of the Caucasus exhibit a lot of linguistic diversity, far more than you’d predict from simple genetics. The Indo-Europeans in Europe may have assimilated linguistically very different people, who were genetically quite similar. In India, they may have assimilated linguistically very different people, who were also genetically distinct.

**Addendum:** I do believe that the highest probability is that Europe and India saw *multiple* intrusive populations after the rise of agriculture. So the larger proportion of the ANI signal probably derives back to the early West Asian farmers.
