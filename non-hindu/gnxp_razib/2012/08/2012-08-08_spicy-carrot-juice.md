Spicy carrot juice

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/220px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg?resize=220%2C370)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/220px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg?resize=220%2C370)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/08/220px-Habanero_closeup_edit2.jpg)Those who have dined with me in “real life” know that when I eat savory foods, with the occasional exception of salads, I tend to enjoy a great deal of spice. By “great deal,” I am someone who can down eight habaneros in 15 minutes while eating potato bread, even if I’m going to regret it later (true incident from June of 2010). Now, I understand for my long term sanity I need to be a bit more moderate, so I usually limit myself to two habaneros per sitting. Additionally, I’m always on the look out for habanero sauces which can combine spice with a richer flavor. [Dave’s Insanity](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DID5R/geneexpressio-20) hits the spice spot, but unfortunately it lacks the fresh and subtle flavor which can be imparted by [Thai peppers](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ET1678/geneexpressio-20).

So today I was curious when I saw a [habanero sauce](http://immortalitynutrition.com/raw-hot-sauce-habanero/) from an outfit called [The Cultured Kitchen](http://immortalitynutrition.com/raw-hot-sauce-habanero/). It was more than \$5.00 for a small container, but I decided to get it. **I was very disappointed, as it was basically spice flavored carrot juice.** Instead of putting it on my salad, as was my intention, I just drank it down like an energy drink so as not to waste it. [The Cultured Kitchen](http://immortalitynutrition.com/raw-hot-sauce-habanero/) seems to market itself as the true “symbiosis of flavor and nutrition.” If so, why may I ask do you have to make your habanero sauces so insipid? I have a nice little pitch for the habanero sauces which The Culture Kitchen produces: **hot sauce so bland that even a W.A.S.P. will retain their composure and grace**!

If you are a small company which produces spicy **and** delicious hot sauces, feel free to [contact me](http://www.razib.com/). I’ll send you a mailing address, and if I like your stuff I’ll be happy to tell everyone that it’s great. Of course to be frank I doubt that the market for my level of spice is going to be very large, but there are always suckers out there who want to impress their girlfriends!
