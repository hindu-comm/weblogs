Ötzi – more Neandertal than the average bear

[Neandertal ancestry “Iced”](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/neandertal-ancestry-iced-2012.html):

> > **Evaluating recent evolution, migration and Neandertal ancestry in > > the Tyrolean Iceman** >
> > Paleogenetic evidence from Neandertals, the Neolithic and other eras > > has the potential to transform our knowledge of human population > > dynamics. Previous work has established the level of contribution of > > Neandertals to living human populations. Here, I consider data from > > the Tyrolean Iceman. The genome of this Neolithic-era individual > > shows a substantially higher degree of Ne- andertal ancestry than > > living Europeans. This comparison suggests that early Upper > > Paleolithic Europeans may have mixed with Neandertals to a greater > > degree than other modern human populations. I also use this genome > > to evaluate the pattern of selection in post-Neolithic Europeans. In > > large part, the evidence of selection from living people’s genetic > > data is confirmed by this specimen, but in some cases selection may > > be disproved by the Iceman’s genotypes. Neolithic-living human > > comparisons provide information about migration and diffusion of > > genes into Europe. I compare these data to the situation within > > Neandertals, and the transition of Neandertals to Upper Paleolithic > > populations – three demographic transitions in Europe that generated > > strong genetic disequi- libria in successive populations.
