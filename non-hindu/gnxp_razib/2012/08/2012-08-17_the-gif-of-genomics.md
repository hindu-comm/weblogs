The GIF of genomics

As you may know the [interminable Myriad genetics patents case](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/08/myriad-genetics-wins-and-loses-i.html) has been making waves in the courts, most recently with mixed results as to whether their patents on[several specific genetic diagnostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_patent#Myriad_Genetics_case) are valid. This aspect needs to be highlighted:

> One of the three deciding judges, William Bryson, dissents in part > from the majority opinion, arguing that Myriad’s claims to the BRCA > gene and gene fragments are not valid. He writes that he feared that if the majority opinion stands, it “will likely have broad consequences, **such as preempting methods for whole-genome sequencing.”**

This is legalistic hyperbole. If “gene patents” become so ridiculous that whole-genome sequencing becomes unfeasible then the system of intellectual property is going to come crashing down. And whole-genome (and exome) sequencing is not that far off. The Myriad case feels **so 2002 to me.** It reminds me of another instance where the sluggishness of the legal process was such that the dispute became a moot point because of the march of technological history: the [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#PNG_and_other_alternatives). A particular company owned the rights to the GIF’s compression technique. But over the years the GIF became a marginal format, and the controversy just faded away.
