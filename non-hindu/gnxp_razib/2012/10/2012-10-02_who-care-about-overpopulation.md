Who cares about overpopulation? Smart people and atheists

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/10/overpop.jpg?resize=594%2C268)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/10/overpop.jpg?resize=594%2C268)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/10/overpop.jpg)

If you had the sense that [Paul Ehrlich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich) and [Garrett Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin) are very much figures of the 1970s nexus of environmentalism and population control, it seems you are right. According to [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=overpopulation%2CMalthusian&year_start=1950&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3) mention of these topics has been declining since peaking during the oil crisis, in the afterglow of the influence of the late 1960s counter-culture. The [general social survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) has a variable, POPGRWTH, which asks:

> And please circle one number for each of these statements to show how much you agree or disagree with it. **The earth cannot continue to support population growth at its present rate.**

The question was asked in the year 2000 and 2010. Demographic breakdowns below for the pooled responses….
