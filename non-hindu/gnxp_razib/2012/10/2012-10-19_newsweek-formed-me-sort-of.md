Newsweek formed me (sort of)

You know that [*Newsweek* is ending its print](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/newsweek-will-cease-print-publication-at-end-of-year/) edition. This was long in the coming. What I find interesting is that apparently its circulation peaked in 1991, at 3.3 million. It declined to 3.1 million in 2007, and literally cratered over the past 5 years to 1.5 million! Thinking back to my own past I remember my interest in *Newsweek*â€˜s cartoons, as well as the in-class discussion triggered by the latest issue of *Time*. There was a time when these were relevant publications. But that ended in 1995, with the rise of the internet. For years the weeklies still maintained the illusion of relevance, but I think they were living on borrowed time. People went through the motions because they always had. After all, the cover of *Time*was important, everyone knew it. Until no one did. The collapse in circulation is just a reflection of the fact that this emperor had long ago shed its clothes.
