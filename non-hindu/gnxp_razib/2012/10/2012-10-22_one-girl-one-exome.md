One girl, one exome

Interesting story in *The San Jose Mercury News*, [Open-source science helps San Carlos father’s genetic quest](http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_21820336/open-source-science-helps-san-carlos-fathers-genetic):

In the end, basically he compared his daughter’s [exome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome) to that of everyone else in the family. By comparing in such a fashion he managed to zero in on a possible causal mutation. This is awesome (the fact that now they know, not the mutation itself). In the near future (\~2 years) I plan to have everyone in my daughter’s pedigree sequenced to a high degree of accuracy so that I can trace with precision the sequence of *de novo* mutations which make each individual distinctive. Not only that, but it may be useful in the future in assessing possible disease risks **unique** to a given individual.

Hugh Reinhoff told his story at the [Open Science Summit](http://opensciencesummit.com/). I don’t think open and DIY science is going to be the whole future, but it is going to be a substantial part of the future. There are just some things that you as an individual have strong incentives to do which you can’t get others interested in. Additionally, collaborative open source science is probably one major push on the margins to make those selling services be more professional and add genuine value. If any reader in the [Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley) is excited about this sort of project you might want to contact [Joseph Jackson](http://opensciencesummit.com/about/). He’s got a lot of ideas and enthusiasm, and is genuinely interested in making a difference in peoples’ lives with a new “bottom-up” paradigm. I’m normally skeptical of such populism, but I’m not entirely happy with the status quo, so a shake up might do science some good.
