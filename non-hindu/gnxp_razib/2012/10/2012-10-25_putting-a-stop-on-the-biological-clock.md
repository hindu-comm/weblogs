Putting a stop on the biological clock

[Egg freezing enters clinical mainstream](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/10/egg-freezing-enters-clinical-mainstream.html):

You can [read the full guidelines, with caveats, online](http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Practice_Guidelines/Committee_Opinions/Ovarian_tissue_and_oocyte(1).pdf). Last I checked this costs on the order of [\$10,000](http://www.fertility-docs.com/fertility_fees.phtml#fees_list). Nothing to sneeze at, but definitely not insane when you consider how much money many couples spend on fertility technologies when women are between 35 and 40.

And of course [I recommend freezing sperm too](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/beware-of-the-ancient-of-days/). That’s far less costly.
