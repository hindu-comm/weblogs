Nature Precedings closes up shop

Here’s the [announcement](http://precedings.nature.com/):

> As of April 3rd 2012, we will cease to accept submissions to Nature > Precedings. Nature Precedings will then be archived, and the archive > will be maintained by NPG, while all hosted content will remain freely > accessible to all. >
> Looking forward, NPG remains committed to exploring ways to help > researchers, funders, and institutions manage data and best practices > in data management, and we plan to introduce new services in this > area. >
> We have truly valued your contributions as authors and users to Nature > Precedings and hope that you will actively participate in this > research and development with us.”

This comes on the heels of [Dr. Joseph Pickrell’s](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/03/identifying-targets-of-natural-selection-in-human-and-dog-evolution.php) first author submission of a [preprint](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/6956/version/1). Correlation? Yes. Coincidence? I’ll let you decide.

In other news the existence and flourishing of [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) puts a whole different spin on “physics envy.” And, just to reiterate, if I post about a paper, and you don’t have access **email me and I will send you the paper**.
