Natural selection and dopamine receptor genes

Long time readers will be familiar with the large literature in behavior genetics/genomics and dopamine receptor genes. So with that, I point you to a paper exploring the patterns of variation and their relationship to possible natural selection, [No Evidence for Strong Recent Positive Selection Favoring the 7 Repeat Allele of VNTR in the DRD4 Gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3164202/?tool=pubmed):

> The human dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene contains a 48-bp variable > number of tandem repeat (VNTR) in exon 3, encoding the third > intracellular loop of this dopamine receptor. The DRD4 7R allele, > which seems to have a single origin, is commonly observed in various > human populations and the nucleotide diversity of the DRD4 7R > haplotype at the DRD4 locus is reduced compared to the most common > DRD4 4R haplotype. Based on these observations, previous studies have > hypothesized that positive selection has acted on the DRD4 7R allele. > However, the degrees of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the DRD4 7R > allele with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the DRD4 > locus have not been evaluated. In this study, to re-examine the > possibility of recent positive selection favoring the DRD4 7R allele, > we genotyped HapMap subjects for DRD4 VNTR, and conducted several > neutrality tests including long range haplotype test and iHS test > based on the extended haplotype homozygosity. Our results indicated that LD of the DRD4 7R allele was not extended compared to SNP alleles with the similar frequency. Thus, we conclude that the DRD4 7R allele has not been subjected to strong recent positive selection.

In that vein, I also stumbled upon this paper recently, [Contrasting signals of positive selection in genes involved in human skin-color variation from tests based on SNP scans and resequencing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22133426):

> Applying all commonly used neutrality-test statistics for allele > frequency distribution to the newly generated sequence data provided > conflicting results regarding evidence for positive selection. > Previous haplotype-based findings could not be clearly confirmed. > Although some tests were marginally significant for some populations > and genes, none of them were significant after multiple-testing > correction. Combined P values for each gene-population pair did not > improve these results. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation > Markov chain Monte Carlo based to these sequence data using a simple > forward simulator revealed broad posterior distributions of the > selective parameters for all four genes, providing no support for > positive selection. However, when we applied this approach to > published sequence data on SLC45A2, another human pigmentation candidate gene, we could readily confirm evidence for positive selection, as previously detected with sequence-based and some haplotype-based tests.

Please note that they didnâ€™t check for selection at *SLC24A5*. This probably would [yielded some evidence of selection](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/03/identifying-targets-of-natural-selection-in-human-and-dog-evolution.php).

Both papers are open access, so I invite readers to take a look for themselves.
