Google+ bombs

[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/gplus.png?resize=594%2C227)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/gplus.png?resize=594%2C227)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/03/gplus.png)

[Google+ Lags Far Behind Facebook, Twitter and MySpace in Latest Study](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/28/idUS85205411620120228):

> Google+ became the fastest growing social network within months of its debut last June, but a recent study casts doubt on whether most of its users are spending much time on the site. >
> According to ComScore, **users spent an average of just 3.3 minutes on Google+ in the month of January**, a decline from its recent figures and a tiny sliver of Facebook’s total.

I accept the argument of [friends](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/) that G+ and Facebook are fundamentally different, and that Google’s aim here is not to replicate Facebook. But I also think that this is well short of what Google was intending for G+ at this stage; otherwise they would surely have quashed the media bubble and hyperbole which crested last summer. G+ is obviously much better than Buzz. But that’s a low bar.
