Health insurance remains (and will remain) relevant

The idea that personal genomics might render insurance irrelevant makes some logical sense. **The only problem is that it oversells the science of prediction in biology, and underestimates the role of randomness in disease outcomes.** As longtime commenter with the original handle “biologist” long ago observed highly inbred lineages of model organisms in a “controlled” environment still exhibit a fair amount of random phenotypic variation. Yes, a non-trivial minority of people will find out that they have a high risk of developing a given disease early on enough in adulthood that the acturial tables imply that they’re uninsurable. But even those with “clean” results should probably still purchase some insurance plan to protect against [‘tail risk’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_risk). People who don’t smoke do get lung cancer, and people without a family history of heart disease and cancer do get heart disease and cancer.

But this idea that personal genomics will bankrupt health insurance is persistent. Why? **I think it’s because some people have strong normative objections to the way health insurance works in the USA.** I say this because many of the same people who espouse the power of genomics in predicting disease outcomes might be far more wary of such ‘genetic determinism’ when it comes to other sorts of life outcomes.

This is not to deny that personal genomics does not pose some problems for insurance. Misha Angrist recently told me that it seems clear that people who are aware of their [APOE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E#Alzheimer.27s_Disease) status are purchasing disability insurance on the sly. The only issue here though is that even those without the APOE alleles which heighten risk of mental deterioration earlier than the norm have a non-trivial likelihood of needing insurance against *unexpected* outcomes.
