Race: maybe it's agriculture

I’m too busy to really blog today, but I thought of putting up a post, the gist of which was actually expressed in [Ian’s comment below:](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/jerry-coyne-on-race-a-reflection-of-evolution/comment-page-1/#comment-127831)

> [When I was younger, I thought of human races as archetypes, and the > variation between them a product of mixing. I blame it on the fact > that I read Coon when I was about 14. Still, as a (half)Indian, it’s > hard to see reconcile the reality of a billion people in the > subcontinent with models that try to classify people into 3-5 races. > As I learned more biology, I came to the conclusion that human > variation was clinal, and race was really an artefact of where you chose to sample along the continuum…as a plant ecologist, I think about things like that a lot. (I’m also somewhat skeptical of ecozones.)](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/jerry-coyne-on-race-a-reflection-of-evolution/comment-page-1/#comment-127831) >
> [Thanks to a number of convergent strands (of which Razib’s blogging has been a key element), I have come to a rather different conclusion. Race, in my opinion, is more a feature of agriculture than evolution.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/jerry-coyne-on-race-a-reflection-of-evolution/comment-page-1/#comment-127831) >

But I’m not convinced by Coyne’s argument that these differences represent the “accumulation of genetic differences between isolated populations”.](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/jerry-coyne-on-race-a-reflection-of-evolution/comment-page-1/#comment-127831)

A hybrid?

Isolation-by-distance is a powerful null model. But if [Reconstructing Indian History](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/nature08365.html) is correct then **it is a poor description of the recent history of the Indian subcontinent.** Since there are \~1.5 billion South Asians I think that that is a major objection. And I don’t think it is just South Asians. Even 10,000 years ago I suspect that a clinal isolation-by-distance model would be confronted by several clusters of demes which were operationally allopatric (e.g., West Eurasia & North Africa vs. East Eurasia, Austarlasia, the New World, Sub-Saharan Africa, and likely South Asia). This probably had to do with the fact that human occupation is not, and was not, evenly distributed.
