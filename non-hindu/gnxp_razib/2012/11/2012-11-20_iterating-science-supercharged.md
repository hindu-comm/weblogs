Iterating science, supercharged

Science is about “updating” with new information. But people are attached to their propositions, and shifts in paradigms can take a very long time, often dependent more on human lifespans than the constellation of the data. But please see this [post by Luke Jostins’](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/11/looking-closer-at-natural-selection-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease.php) over at [Genomes Unzipped](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/11/looking-closer-at-natural-selection-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease.php). He has “updated” his own view of his recent [Nature paper](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/11/irritable-bowel-syndrome-is-natures-side-effect/) on inflammatory bowel disease. This is rather awesome, because yes, there was some talk about the balancing selection aspect of the paper at ASHG, and now Luke has gone and amended his own position.

The reality is that emotions are a big deal in science. But in *theory*we simply look at the evidence. Bridging that gap, and shifting the balance to the latter, is very important in keeping the enterprise honest, fruitful, and attractive to young scholars. I’m hoping that the more rapid dissemination of information via projects like [Haldane’s Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) will aid in the rate of iteration.
