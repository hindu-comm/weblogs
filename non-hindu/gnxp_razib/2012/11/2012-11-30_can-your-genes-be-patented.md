Can your genes be patented?

[Court to Decide if Human Genes Can Be Patented](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2012/11/30/us/politics/ap-us-supreme-court-cancer-patent-.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0&pagewanted=print). So it seems a group of middle aged to very aged lawyers will decide the decades long [Myriad Genetics saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_Genetics#Legislation_and_Litigation). My position on this issue is simple: **if you are going to award patents, they must be awarded to acts of engineering, not discoveries of science.** See [Genomics Law Report](http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/11/30/supreme-court-to-rule-on-patentability-of-human-genes/) for more well informed commentary.
