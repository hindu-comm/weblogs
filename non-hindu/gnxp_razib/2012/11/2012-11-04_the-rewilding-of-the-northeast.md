The rewilding of the Northeast

If you accept the thesis reported by [Charles C. Mann](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/09/10-questions-for-charles-c-mann/) the great eastern forest which the American settlers turned into farmland was actually secondary growth. The consequence of the depopulation of vast swaths of North America of its indigenous population due to disease which preceded the expansion of Europeans (recall that until 1800 whites hugged the Atlantic coast, leaving the interior to indigenous people by and large). And yet by 1900 that great forest was gone. Now it’s back again. A piece in *The Wall Street Journal* highlights how incredibly robust the recovery has been, [America Gone Wild](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204846304578090753716856728.html):

Much of this is due to increased agricultural productivity in the Heartland. The article discusses at length the problem of suburban and exurban sprawl, and how it has resulted in an intersection between the wilds and the urban frontier. One way to mitigate this problem would be to refocus on the value of dense urban living, and perhaps the construction of genuine [arcologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology) which were insulted from nature. This does not mean that people should avoid nature, but, they could experience it when they chose to experience it, instead of living within it. The example of the Western United States is I think instructive: many of these states are very urban, but they also foster an “outdoors lifestyle.”
