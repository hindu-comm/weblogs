[![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/11/RaccoonLion.jpg?resize=200%2C331)![](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/11/RaccoonLion.jpg?resize=200%2C331)](https://i0.wp.com/blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/files/2012/11/RaccoonLion.jpg)If you aren’t too stuffed, ask! I plan to get my simultaneous review of [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don’t](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159420411X/geneexpressio-20) and [Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046502324X/geneexpressio-20)up over the holiday weekend, but I’m going to be focused on other things besides the blog obviously. That being said, to be frank I don’t personally feel that the regular reader of this weblog would get much value from [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159420411X/geneexpressio-20) (Nate Silver interviews[Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/). I didn’t need to read his book to be aware of Robin Hanson’s ideas, he quite freely shares them to all curiosity seekers [on the internet](http://www.overcomingbias.com/) and in person).[Uncontrolled](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046502324X/geneexpressio-20)adds more value in my opinion because experiments in social science are more difficult, and probably more genuinely ground-breaking (if less sexy), than statistical inference.
