Open Thread, 11-29-2012

**Update:** You can leave comments now.*But*, you are forced to register with no third party login option. I know many of you don’t like the last, because you are emailing me about it. If the quantity of responses (\<5, vs. the usually of \~50 for an “open thread”) on this thread is a measure I suspect that I’ll have to switch web-discussion mostly to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razibkhan)or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/razibkhan99). I balk at registering to comment personally, so I totally understand.

As you may have noticed there are some issues with*Discover Blog*‘s transition to a new system. But once comments work again, feel free to post here. I’m busy with some other things right now besides the blog, so I’m going to take the current technical issues as an excuse to not post for a few days.
