Why Marco Rubio waffled on the age of rocks (in numbers)

If you have a pulse and follow “science news” you are aware that [Marco Rubio](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/marco-rubio-not-a-scientist/) [gave a very equivocal](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/rubios-science-as-theology/) answer to a very simple question about the age of the earth. As many have [noted](http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/) this is basically a way to call out Republican politicians for the fact that they have to satisfy the cultural signals of a segment of the American population which has a deep hostility to science which undercuts their naive reading of the Bible. To [Mitt Romney’s credit](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/romney-elaborates-on-evolution/) he did not evade on this question, but gave a mainstream answer among the well educated. This sort of political pandering isn’t too surprising. Remember Hillary Clinton dismissing [‘elite economists’](http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/05/idUSN04324440) when it came to her silly gas tax suspension idea? It’s a democracy, and that means you can get very far appealing to the populist sentiment.

More concretely, I want to address something Rod Dreher [asserted at *The American Conservative*](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/rubios-science-as-theology/):

> I wish one of these liberal journalists would go into a black or > Latino church supper and ask people their thoughts about how the > universe began. I’d bet that 99 percent of the people there would > agree with Marco Rubio, even if most of them would vote for his > opponent. People just don’t care about this stuff at the national > political level. You’d better believe I’d fight over this issue if it came down to a matter of what was going to be taught in my local school. But I couldn’t possibly care less what the guy who lives in the White House thinks, unless he tries to impose it on the country.

When I hear the word “bet” I start thinking of laying down odds and stealing someone’s cash! But in this case I’ll assume Rod was being rhetorical. But let’s review the numbers, shall we?  

The [General Social Survey](http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10) has a variable, EVOLVED, which records the response to the question “Human beings developed from animals,” with a true vs. false outcome. It was asked between 2006 and 2010. You can see the results for numerous demographics below.
