Eugenics, the 100 year cycle

*The Chronicle of Higher Education* has a piece out by Nathaniel Comfort, [The Eugenic Impulse](http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/). I would just like to offer that to a great extent **we already live in the second age of eugenics.** The high frequency of abortions of fetuses which come back positive for Down syndrome is well known. But it seems possible that we’ll be able to reduce the frequency of many Mendelian diseases as well. Basically those ailments which are due to a major mutation of large effect and high penetrance (i.e., you have the mutation, you have the disease).

A major goal which we’re very far from though is the ability to select for quantitative traits. There are technical hurdles, both tactical and strategic, here. The major issue is that there are simply too many variants for one to be able to select a ‘perfect’ genetic profile. Those who’ve talked to me know my response in this domain: **select for low mutational load**. High coverage fetal whole genome sequencing would do that. The marketing pitch for this writes itself: imagine you, but bright of mind, and beautiful of face!
