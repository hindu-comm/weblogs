Tomatoes!

This story in *The New York Times*, [Flavor Is Price of Scarlet Hue of Tomatoes, Study Finds](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/science/flavor-is-the-price-of-tomatoes-scarlet-hue-geneticists-say.html?hp&pagewanted=print), is pretty cool:

> Yes, they are often picked green and shipped long distances. Often they are refrigerated, which destroys their flavor and texture. But now researchers have discovered a genetic reason that diminishes a tomato’s flavor even if the fruit is picked ripe and coddled. >
> The unexpected culprit is a gene mutation that occurred by chance and that was discovered by tomato breeders. It was deliberately bred into almost all tomatoes because it conferred an advantage: It made them a uniform luscious scarlet when ripe. >
> Now, in a paper published in the journal Science, **researchers report > that the very gene that was inactivated by that mutation plays an important role in producing the sugar and aromas that are the essence of a fragrant, flavorful tomato.** And these findings provide a road map for plant breeders to make better-tasting, evenly red tomatoes.

The paper, [Uniform ripening Encodes a Golden 2-like Transcription Factor Regulating Tomato Fruit Chloroplast Development](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6089/1711):

> Modern tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) varieties are bred for uniform > ripening (u) light green fruit phenotypes to facilitate harvests of > evenly ripened fruit. U encodes a Golden 2-like (GLK) transcription > factor, SlGLK2, which determines chlorophyll accumulation and > distribution in developing fruit. In tomato, two GLKs—SlGLK1 and > SlGLK2—are expressed in leaves, but only SlGLK2 is expressed in fruit. > Expressing GLKs increased the chlorophyll content of fruit, whereas > SlGLK2 suppression recapitulated the u mutant phenotype. GLK > overexpression enhanced fruit photosynthesis gene expression and > chloroplast development, leading to elevated carbohydrates and > carotenoids in ripe fruit. SlGLK2 influences photosynthesis in developing fruit, contributing to mature fruit characteristics and suggesting that selection of u inadvertently compromised ripe fruit quality in exchange for desirable production traits.

Genetics for better living! But I had no idea that the laws in regards to mutant varieties were so retrograde:

> But were the genetically engineered tomatoes more flavorful? **Because Department of Agriculture regulations forbid the consumption of experimental produce, no one tasted them.** >
> And, Dr. Giovannoni says, do not look for those genetically engineered tomatoes at the grocery store. Producers would not dare to make such a tomato for fear that consumers would reject it. >
> But, Dr. Powell said, there is a way around the issue. Heirloom tomatoes and many wild species do not have the uniform ripening mutation. “The idea is to get the vegetable seed industry interested,” Dr. Powell said.
