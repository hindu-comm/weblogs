Technology that brought down civilization

[The IVF Panic: ‘All Hell Will Break Loose, Politically and Morally, All Over the World’](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/06/the-ivf-panic-all-hell-will-break-loose-politically-and-morally-all-over-the-world/258954/):

The past is not always prologue, but it’s very instructive to look at newspapers from a given time period and see what the public mood was. Fear is a natural human reaction to new technology. My general bias is that technology itself usually isn’t as disruptive as [social innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community). That being said, ***when*** technology is genuinely revolutionary it can have a [much bigger impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) than social or institutional shifts.
