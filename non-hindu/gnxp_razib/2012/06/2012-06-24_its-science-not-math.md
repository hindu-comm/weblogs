It's science, not math

My post below elicited this [response](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/06/sex-sport/comment-page-1/#comment-139515):

First, I didn’t really need that lecture. My post actually linked to [androgen insensitivity syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome). And I’m aware of other forms of inter/ambiguous sex, as noted above. And of course **there are species where sex, as opposed to gender, is more fluid and facultative.** I’m aware of all that.

Rather, the issue hinges around the assertion that we must have a category system which covers *all* individuals. If that’s your criterion than **the vast majority of scientific concepts are social constructions with imperfect mapping.** So, for example, people should legitimately attack the Endangered Species Act as being grounded in fuzzy science (the species concept). We shouldn’t talk of planets and asteroids, where do you draw the line? And so forth.

If you assume that sex determination occurs through inheritance of sex chromosomes, the distribution above for sex diagnostic characteristics should be expected. You can generate a synthetic metric, and males and females should cluster together. But you’re going to have developmental and chromosomal abnormalities, with the latter leading to a third mode in between the male and female.

I wouldn’t make much of this argument, **but I’ve encountered a rejection of the sex concept from biologists.** Which begs the question: what the hell are evolutionary biologists studying then when it comes to sex? Obviously the last is a silly question, everyone knows what biologists are studying. It doesn’t matter that sex is not a concept which exhibits the perfect clarity and precision of a mathematical proof. It’s about as good as it gets in biology for an abstract category. We aren’t sure how to define life itself! That means biology in its own foundation doesn’t exhibit the stringency some require from sex.
