Singularity Summit 2012

Many of you know that I am on good terms with many people involved with the [Singularity Institute](http://singularity.org/) and the [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/) community. This year I am going to be at the [Singularity Summit](http://singularitysummit.com/2012/04/04/singularity-summit-2012-lineup/), [October 13th & 14th](http://singularitysummit.com/2012/04/04/singularity-summit-2012-lineup/) in San Francisco, after skipping the past few. I’m excited to meet up [Carl](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/) and [Robin](http://www.overcomingbias.com/) again, and I really hope that I’ll finally run into [Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/) (I had lunch with some of his GMU colleages back in 2007, but he was out of town). I’ve also confirmed with Steven Pinker that he’s most likely going to be there (no offense, but the bigger the name, the more likely that conferences are going to trumpet the presence of a speaker when their services are highly provisional).

I understand that many readers are skeptical of Transhumanism, Singulitarianism, etc. What I would like to offer is that **people who are open to exploring these far out topics are often extremely intellectually engaging more generally.** My goal in life is to [“avoid boring people”](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375727140/geneexpressio-20), and I find that events like the Singularity Summit are aids to that (also, see the [BIL](http://www.bilconference.com/) conferences).
