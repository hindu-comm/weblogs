Parkinson’s disease patients & free 23andMe

[Michelle](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/crude-matter/2012/02/24/parkinsons-disease-patients-get-free-lifetime-access-to-23andme-personal-genome-service/) tipped me off to [23andMe’s new initiative](https://www.23andme.com/pd/) to get Parkison’s disease sufferers genotyped. Basically, if you are a sufferer, you get the service for free. The goal presumably to increase the sample size so as to pick up new possible associations. But a question: **can you think of a downside for Parkinson’s disease sufferers?** A lot of people have genetic privacy concerns, but if you manifest a disease like Parkinson’s I suspect that’s the least of your worries.
