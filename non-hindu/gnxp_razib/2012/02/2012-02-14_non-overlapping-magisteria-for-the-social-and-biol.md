Non-overlapping magisteria for the social and biological?

Most of you know that Stephen Jay Gould proposed [‘non-overlapping magisteria’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria) for science and religion. I don’t care much for the framing myself, though neither am I on the same page as Sam Harris and company. But I thought of this model when reading this [comment below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/the-social-and-biological-construction-of-race/#comment-124560):

This all sounds reasonable, and some of the points are of course factually correct (e.g., racial identity as it is lived is a real thing, irrespective of one’s genetic heritage). And to some extent I implicitly accept the idea that social and natural scientists should use differing language; I often use terms like ‘population’ when I could just as well use race. As I said, for me the key is not the language, but the set of propositions you do, or don’t, accept.

But consider this: **will social scientists stop citing [‘Lewontin’s Fallacy’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Human_genetic_diversity:_Lewontin's_fallacy%22_(scientific_paper)) in the near future?** I doubt it. Biological science has prestige and privilege, and social scientists will naturally attempt to integrate biological arguments when it serves their interests. Additionally, those social scientists who reject scholarship which focuses on the intersection of the biological and social sciences, such as evolutionary psychology or behavior genetics, have to use biological language as best they can. This is due to the fact that in the hierarchy of disciplines biology is more fundamental than the social sciences. By analogy, a biologist who rejected the utility of models and methods from chemistry really needs to address chemistry on its own terms. If they don’t do this, usually the skepticism of chemical reductionism reverts to vague assertions of complexity and emergence in biological systems. Some cultural anthropologists address this point frankly by rejecting the categorization of their discipline as science.
