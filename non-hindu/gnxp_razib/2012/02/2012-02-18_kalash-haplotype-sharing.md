Kalash haplotype sharing

Prompted by my posts, Dienekes, [A teaser on the Kalash](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2012/02/teaser-on-kalash.html):

Here is the bar plot which Dienekes generated (left to right indicates extent of “donation” to the Kalash):

I highlighted the most significant non-South Asian donor. Dienekes states:

The main issue I would point out is that **“West Asians” are probably a major donor to *both* South Asians and Northern Europeans.** In any case, the [Lezgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lezgian_people) are a North Caucasian non-Indo-Eurpean population. But this is what came to mind:

[Geographical distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_G_(Y-DNA)#Geographical_Distribution) of G:

Otzi the Iceman was G, and G is found in mountains areas of Southern Europe, as well as among groups like Tamil Brahmins. My own hunch is that G came with men who *first* brought agriculture to Europe. This does not mean that they were among the first agriculturalists in South Asia, but there may be some deep connection to pulses out of the trans-Caucasian region.

As far as my initial assertion that **the Kalash are a liminal *South Asian* population, that seems supported by the high matches to many South Asian groups.** But my own contention was more specific: that the Kalash exhibit evidence of admixture with the indigenous people of Southern Eurasia, the “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), attesting to their deep origins within the subcontinent. This is not necessarily true even if they share a lot of haplotypes with South Asians, because the Kalash and Indians proper may share common donors for “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI). Nevertheless, they seem to have *some* relationship to the [ANI-ASI](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/suppinfo/nature08365.html) cline identified by Reich et al. (albeit, possibly more complex than that of the Pathans).
