Free 23andMe genotyping

From [OpenSNP](http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/apply-now-for-a-free-genotyping/):

> At the[end of last year we announced that we’ve got some funding from > the German WikiMedia foundation to get more people – who are willing > to share their results – > genotyped](http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/happy-holidays/). > We have now settled on a process that should allow us to perform the > project without too many problems.**[Starting today, you can apply for > one of the free > genotypings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGZST2FKckotTjZ3SEwyWHlVakcxb1E6MQ#gid=0)**. > The**deadline for applications is Sunday, 03/25/12 23:59 o’clock**, > so you still have some time to think about an application. In the two > weeks following the deadline, we will select as many participants as > we can afford to get genotyped using the 5000 Euros we received from Wikimedia. We’ll get in contact with everybody who has sent an application to let all applicants know whether their application was successful or not. >
> The genotyping will be done through*23andMe*. We will order you a > gift kit which will be delivered to your address. These gift kits > include prepaid access to the*23andMe*website for 12 months, so you can check up on the latest findings about your genetic variation as well. After this 12 month period, those features will expire automatically, you don’t have to cancel any subscriptions. >
> Our application form contains some standard questions (Where do you > live? Does*23andMe*deliver to your country? etc.) but also some > details about your motivation, why you want to make your dataset > available to the public and why your data might be of great interest > (For example: Do you have a rare disease where research is lacking?). > Additionally, we will also try to get people genotyped who > are[currently > under-represented](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/02/update-on-the-afrikaner-genotype/)in > publicly available data sets. Most data up to now is from[*WEIRDs: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic*](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7825833#)people (most are probably male, too).

Bastian already contacted me about getting Afrikaners typed this way. I haven’t had time to get back to him, but this might be a viable option if you live in a country where 23andMe ships.
