Your child's genome before the 2nd trimester?

A [long piece](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2012/04/noninvasive_prenatal_diagnostic_tests_ethics_abortion_and_insurance_coverage_.single.html) in *Slate*, [Will Gattaca come True](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/future_tense/2012/04/noninvasive_prenatal_diagnostic_tests_ethics_abortion_and_insurance_coverage_.single.html)?:

First, it’s rather crazy that as we live and breathe it is on the order of \$20,000 to get a genome of your unborn children! I say on the order because no one knows, and I assume that they’re being optimistic here for media consumption. We plan to get screening for karyotype scale issues for our next child, so I keep track of this area with some interest.

All that being said, **without pre-implantation genetic diagnosis it’s going to be very unlikely that you will get the “perfect child,” barring gene therapy.** I may be unimaginative, but I can’t see the actionable use of a relatively dense genotype, let alone a full genome, at this stage once you eliminate the risks of very problematic diseases. I suppose at this point I can divulge that I tried to get my daughter’s genetic material from a [c.v.s.](http://www.babycenter.com/0_chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs_328.bc), so she couldget typed while she was *in utero*, but that was mostly for the “wow!” factor (for what it’s worth, it’s really hard to get genetic material back from large biomedical firms).

Finally, I don’t find the beating-around-the-bush about “trick ethical questions” that is par for the course of these sorts of pieces useful. The reality is that most of the public finds this aspect of personal genomics “scary.” You don’t need to genuflect to it, just accept it as a given. Rather, lay out the issues in explicit detail, and let the people make their own judgement.
