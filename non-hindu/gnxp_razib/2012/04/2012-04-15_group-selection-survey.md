Group selection survey

I don’t have time to do a detailed analysis of my [group selection survey](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/what-do-you-think-about-group-selection/) right now. So I’ve uploaded the [raw results](https://www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/groupselection.zip) for anyone to play with (there is no personally identifying information obviously). You should be able to convert it into an appropriate format for R or something else pretty easily.
