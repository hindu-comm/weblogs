An algorithm is just an algorithm

In the [comments below](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/a-deeper-dive-analysis-of-two-cubans/comment-page-1/#comment-133640):

Cuba-2 seems actually admixed at low levels and both seem to have some Amerindian ancestry not existent in Spain.

This is a fair point. I switched computers recently, and the Behar et al. data set I had seems to have become corrupted. So I snatched the Mozabites from the HGDP, and removed the Gujaratis from the previous run. I also added Russians, Druze, and some extra Amerindian groups. At K = 7 this pattern jumped out:

The Mozabites have “swallowed” most of the “African” component in the Iberian populations. But **not** in the two Cubans. The main objection I would have is that the Northern European groups now show some African, which is likely to be an artifact. It does seem unlikely though that the Cuban African element is due these individuals being Northern European rather than Southwest European. These ADMIXTURE results also align Cuba 1 better with the PCA, where the individual was definitely an outlier.

Another illustration that knowledge comes not through blind adherence to methods, but human reflection.
