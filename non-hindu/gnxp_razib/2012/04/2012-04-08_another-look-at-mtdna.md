Another look at mtDNA

The new article in *The American Journal of Human Genetics*, [A “Copernican” Reassessment of the Human Mitochondrial DNA Tree from its Root](http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(12)00146-2), is open access, so you should check it out. The discussion gets to the heart of the matter:

Inevitably, the proposed change could raise some temporary inconveniences. For this reason, we provide tables and software to aid data transition. >

Perhaps the first generation or so of human molecular evolutionary genetics might be thought of as a “first draft.” A serviceable first draft which rendered in broad strokes the gist of the truth as we understand it, but lacking in some essential details.

On a minor note, there are some theoretical reasons why mtDNA did not yield much evidence for archaic admixture, which is clear in the nuclear genomics (e.g., higher rate of change due to lower effective population size, so more rapid extinction of ancient lineages). But perhaps now that the number of complete mtDNA genomes is increasing in size we might start to see “long branches,” which reflect the inferences generated from the ancient nuclear genomes.
