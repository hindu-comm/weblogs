Reprising genes & geography

[Comparing Spatial Maps of Human Population-Genetic Variation Using Procrustes Analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2861313/?tool=pubmed):

There is concordance. But look at the figure below. On the left are populations where they were sampled, and the right shows the populations displayed in a manner to reflect genetic distances.

I don’t want to make too much of this. The HGDP populations tend to be sampled from particularly distinctive groups consciously. But it does look like there is a stronger genetic clustering effect than one can predict from geography alone. That warrants investigation. I will leave the rest for comment.
