An economics and evolutionary biology reading list

I have added a new page over at [Evolving Economics](http://www.jasoncollins.org) with a suggested reading list for those interested in the intersection of economics and evolutionary biology. The list is [here](http://www.jasoncollins.org/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/ "Economics and evolutionary biology reading list").

The list is a work is progress, and I plan to update it as new sources emerge or are suggested (or when I realise what oversights I have made). I also intend to constrain it to the best sources, rather than being a complete list on every thought on the topic.

I am interested in suggestions from gnxp readers, so please let me know if you have any thoughts. Comments can also be made at the bottom of the [reading list page](http://www.jasoncollins.org/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/ "Economics and evolutionary biology reading list").
