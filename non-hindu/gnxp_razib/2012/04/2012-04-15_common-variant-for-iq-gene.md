Common variant for "IQ gene"?

A few people have forwarded me this paper, [Identification of common variants associated with human hippocampal and intracranial volumes](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2250.html):

Look at the sample sizes. Beware of [behavior genomics with small sample sizes](http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2012/04/oxtr-false-positive.php). Paul Thompson, one of the many authors of this paper, [is giving media interviews](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/health/research/crowd-sourcing-brain-research-leads-to-breakthrough.html). To me that’s a good sign, as he’s a very smart guy. He has some confidence in this study. Here’s the section which is resulting in the forwards:

I’m a homozygote for the T allele for what it’s worth. But that’s not surprising. Look at the population distribution of the C allele from the HapMap:

I think [CD-CV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_disease-common_variant) is played out when it comes to IQ or height. Note that the gene in which this SNP is located, *HMGA2*, is also implicated in height variation. In fact, aside from pathological mutations, this locus may have the largest effect height **and** IQ polymorphisms in replicable studies (genetic and genomic, linkage and GWAS, IQ studies have a history of not being replicated, probably because of low power).

**Update:** See [Luke Justins’ comment](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/common-variant-for-iq-gene/#comments). My post above was rooted in a mild misipression due to read-post-and-dash. My bad. So we’ll see if the ‘endophenotype’ pans out.
