Standardized test scores: math and verbal

Prompted by [miko’s skepticism](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/04/verbal-intelligence-by-demographic/#comment-132983) about the utility of WORDSUM (a vocab test) across subcultures, I went and looked for SAT data. My assumption was that math sections are more “culture-fair” (though from what I gather ETS tries hard in various ways to be culture-fair in general). The [data was not hard to find](http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_151.asp):
