A bit too many names and battles (narrative), rather than social and economic dynamics. But it‚Äôs a good inversion of the traditional narrative, and illustrates just how chaotic and fractions the Islamic world in the last decades of the 11th-century was. Western European society was coming back to Roman levels of density and complexity after 1000 A.D., and for various reasons, the last half of the 11th-century was a period of disunity in the lands of Islam, so the Crusades were timed very fortuitous for the Franks.

But for some reason, it has much worse Amazon reviews than Thomas Ashbridge‚Äôs [The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003C2SP6E/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=gKrMGMT2M3kWiREupptC6A&slotNum=10&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55). Does anyone know why?

Interesting historical fantasy I stumbled across, [The City of Brass](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06VXWPMV5/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=gKrMGMT2M3kWiREupptC6A&slotNum=10&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55). The author is a white ethnic woman from New Jersey who converted to Islam as a teen, and now has a last name which is associated with Bengali Brahmins ([she also pronounces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKrFl7V77o) very peculiarly). The reviews are good, but I‚Äôm not a fan of historical fantasy. Mixing the real and fantastic doesn‚Äôt appeal to me.

Dante is [still selling 30x WGS for \$229](https://us.dantelabs.com/) as of this writing. No, I have no idea how Dante works in regards to this price point. But apparently, it‚Äôs not a fraud.

Michael Behe has a new book out. [Richard Lenksi](https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/tag/michael-behe/) has responded in detail on his weblog.

I read [Darwin‚Äôs Black Box](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FBJHS0/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=gKrMGMT2M3kWiREupptC6A&slotNum=10&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55) and Michael Denton‚Äôs [Evolution: A Theory in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0917561058/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=gKrMGMT2M3kWiREupptC6A&slotNum=10&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55) 20 year ago. Not convinced. That being said, people without a scientific background can be impressed easily. I still remember the stupid reader who incredibly blown-away by the pig-headed sophistry in David Stove‚Äôs [Darwinian Fairytales: Selfish Genes, Errors of Heredity and Other Fables of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001T4YVXI/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at/?imprToken=gKrMGMT2M3kWiREupptC6A&slotNum=10&imprToken=y35SghEGEXIWbF1reLx1Gw&slotNum=33&imprToken=LpkHwvjD9DZhnme4GGPFmQ&slotNum=1&creativeASIN=0981519423&linkCode=w61&imprToken=WvNSQCwEIP9qt7KZM0qiUA&slotNum=55). I read the book because the reader was impressed, and the reader was someone who I didn‚Äôt have a strong opinion about. I came away concluding that the reader must be kind of a moron since the book itself was just plain ignorant in the literal sense.

I‚Äôm still trying to place a piece in [The Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/) on evolution. They gave me a few suggestions. Friends who have read my draft were already impressed, so I‚Äôm 90% sure I can get this placed in the conservative media. I actually interviewed the author of this piece, [Why One-Third Of Biologists Now Question Darwinism](https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/one-third-biologists-now-question-darwinism/), for the [Browncast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/). The podcast will go live tomorrow.

[Genome-wide sexually antagonistic variants reveal long-standing constraints on sexual dimorphism in fruit flies](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000244). This is a really interesting paper. The citations are interesting too.
