Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are genetically similar to full-siblings or mother and son

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Emilia_Clarke_Interview_2018_2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Emilia_Clarke_Interview_2018_2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emilia_Clarke_Interview_2018_2.jpg)I’ve posted on this before. So I will post again just to reiterate something: **in terms of genes, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are much closer to being full-siblings than they are to being aunt and nephew.**

You get different numbers depending on how deeply you look at the pedigree of the two. But their relatedness is probably above 40% and below 50%. Others have confirmed:

The verbal reason without math and genealogies is simple: Daenerys Targaryen comes from an inbred lineage, and more importantly, **two generations of brother-sister marriages.** This means that Daenerys Targaryen and Rhaegar Targaryen were genetically much more similar than typical full-siblings. Because of this, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are much more genetically similar than typical aunts and nephews, because Jon Snow’s father was to a first approximation genetically a male and older version of Daenerys Targaryen.
