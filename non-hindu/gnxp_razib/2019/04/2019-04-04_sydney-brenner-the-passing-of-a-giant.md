Sydney Brenner: the passing of a giant

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wormbook.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wormbook.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231131461/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=1gdaxJrSm-0NuwLUnHCWGQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=sum9CqsYJjtGHLfe-b-7CQ&slotNum=29&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164)[Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, who helped place Singapore on biotech world stage, dies at 92](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nobel-laureate-sydney-brenner-who-helped-place-singapore-on-biotech-world-stage-dies-at-92). If you are in genetics and development you know who Brenner his, and what he meant to these fields. I happened to be in the room with Brenner once, in Berkeley in 2008 I believe. He was already quite an old curmudgeon, and I will say his comments were amusing and awkward!

Long-time readers of this weblog know that about fifteen years ago I dabbled in a little worm-work. At that time I read [In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0231131461/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=1gdaxJrSm-0NuwLUnHCWGQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=sum9CqsYJjtGHLfe-b-7CQ&slotNum=29&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164). As Brenner was involved in promoting *C. elegans* as a model he occupies a lot of this book. I recommend it. Itâ€™s short and packed with historical nuggets that make the 21st-century trajectory of science more comprehensible.
