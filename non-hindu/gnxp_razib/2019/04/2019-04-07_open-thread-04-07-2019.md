The last 1/3 is a bunch of stuff about the Emirate of Granada that’s hard to keep track of. If you didn’t know that in 1500 most of the Muslim communities of the peninsula outside of Granada were in the kingdom of Aragon, then this book is worth reading, as it explains the reasons for this.

The [Brown Pundits](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/) podcast is going to release a bunch of stuff in the next few days (already on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan) page). Readers of this weblog will probably appreciate the conversation with [Zaid Jilani](https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) the most. We talk about whether Matt Yglesias really believes the stuff he puts out there. Zaid has some insights. The podcast could have gone much longer because it’s interesting to talk to someone who doesn’t have paint-by-the-numbers answers to everything.

Need to think more deeply on this. But recommended.
