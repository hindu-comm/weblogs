The expansion of modern humans ~50,000 as part of a regular Poisson process

New analysis of the human genetic diversity in modern Madagascar suggests the current population derives primarily from two waves of migration: first from Indonesia 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, and later from mainland Africa 1,500 years ago. >

This research about Madagascar is important. If it turns out correct, I think it gives us deep insights about the expansion of modern humans outside of Africa \~50,000 years ago, and why their arrival resulted in the extinction of so many other human lineages. A generation ago we might have posited that some massive bio-behavioral change is what triggered this, **but I am coming closer to the idea that cultural changes are punctuated enough that that may actually explain things.** The culture changes first, then genes follow the culture.

Perhaps one might posit a model with massive turnovers in the hominin lineage due to this cultural dynamic occurs periodically, as if it’s a Poisson process.
