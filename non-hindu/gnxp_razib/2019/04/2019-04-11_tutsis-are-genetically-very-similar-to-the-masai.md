Tutsis are genetically very similar to Masai

Many years ago, before I used [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html), I did a little analysis of the genetics of the [Tutsi](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2011/08/31/tutsi-genetics-ii/). Actually, it was the genetics of a single Tutsi, or more precisely, someone who was 75% Tutsi ancestry (3 out of 4 grandparents).

**I found that the Tutsi individual seemed quite distinct from the Bantu peoples in nearby Kenya.** I suggested that it was likely that the Tutsi were then genetically distinct from the Hutu people amongst whom they lived. For many years this was part of the [genetics section of the Wikipedia entry on the Tutsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi#Autosomal_DNA_(overall_ancestry)), but recently the reference was removed and the page seems to have been re-edited.

That’s fine. I’m just a random blogger who had one sample. But as it happened recently **about a dozen Diasporic Tutsis reached out to me.** Over the last decade, the [number of people who have been genotyped has increased greatly](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1506-1). So it wasn’t that difficult for interested parties to find these genotypes.

The mission they put before me is simple: **“tell us about our genetics”.** Over the next few weeks, I’ll do that. As there is no [IRB](https://research.oregonstate.edu/irb/frequently-asked-questions/what-institutional-review-board-irb), this won’t be published in a peer-reviewed journal (I am open to putting any researcher in contact with these Tutsis who reached out to me). I’m just going to put what I find out there so that Tutsis who do personalized genetic testing can make sense of what they’re finding out.

I received these genotypes today. A quick merge of samples I have reduced it down to 50,000 markers. I will work on creating a merge with a larger number of markers. But, I’ll report what I have found out so far as a first pass.

**As you can see on the PCA plot above the Tutsi overlap almost perfectly with the Masai**. Not with the Kenyan Bantu, or the Luo, who are more “African” shifted. But with the Masai. But, they are not as “Eurasian shifted” as the Somali.

Treemix confirms this:

The Tutsi and Masai are right next to each other. Between the Somalis, and other Sub-Saharan Africans.

Running 5 migration edges, **you see gene flow into the Tutsi from Cushitic populations**.

I ran Admixture at K = 6. You can see the [raw results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmLUNAzl47KP-CmuS8hax5GyTyc1CFz1KH1BZso3INc/edit?usp=sharing), but the chart makes it clear, the Tutsi are like the Masai:

The same for K = 7:

I think that’s all for now. More later!
