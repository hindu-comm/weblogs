[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/161036.jpg?resize=200%2C200&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/161036.jpg?resize=200%2C200&ssl=1)](https://insitome.libsyn.com/)Just a reminder for people to check in on [The Insight](https://insitome.libsyn.com/) this week. Lots of talk about Denisovans between Spencer and myself. We’ve also got a follow-up podcast scheduled with a researcher working in Denisovan genomics in a few weeks (we’re on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5qeAd2HfmD7K6jZJNPITnw) now by the way).

[Our three new hires at George Mason economics](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/04/our-three-new-hires-at-george-mason-economics.html). These look good.

[Sri Lanka Suicide Bombings Targeting Christians Kill Hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/world/asia/sri-lanka-bombings.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage). The most likely culprits seem to be a jihadist group active in southern South Asia.

[A Transient Pulse of Genetic Admixture from the Crusaders in the Near East Identified from Ancient Genome Sequences](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(19)30111-9). I think the “Crusader genes” are hard to find in the Near East because the collapse of the Latin kingdoms was gradual enough that “Franks” and their scions mostly managed to get out and go back to Western Europe.

[Why One-Third Of Biologists Now Question Darwinism](https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/one-third-biologists-now-question-darwinism/). I’m writing a response to this piece for *The Federalist*. Rather than a response to Intelligent Design, I want to represent what evolutionary biology really is.
