Murray Gell-Mann, R.I.P.

The author of the obit wrote [Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0043M4ZCA/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=Fjt75aM2x2EY0LP005Ogng&slotNum=0&imprToken=tdNCVSWXYcto2jqWMV87Qg&slotNum=0&imprToken=3SzvErsqk0uegISbc6B6.g&slotNum=0&imprToken=T99HvL7y.cNmVg.TW4Q7EQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=67TxncJrNOO11LKRkLbXog&slotNum=23&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164).

I’m not as broadly read today as I was when I was younger. Much of my teen years were spent reading popular science books on physics. Murray Gell-Mann regularly made a showing, whether as a principal character, or a cameo. He was one of the great ones of our world, and his passing makes us all poorer.
