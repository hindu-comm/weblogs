Problems in PRS?

[Variable prediction accuracy of polygenic scores within an ancestry group](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629949v1):

> Fields as diverse as human genetics and sociology are increasingly > using polygenic scores based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) > for phenotypic prediction. However, recent work has shown that > polygenic scores have limited portability across groups of different > genetic ancestries, restricting the contexts in which they can be used > reliably and potentially creating serious inequities in future > clinical applications. Using the UK Biobank data, **we demonstrate > that even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of > polygenic scores depends on characteristics such as the age or sex > composition of the individuals in which the GWAS and the prediction > were conducted**, and on the GWAS study design. Our findings highlight > both the complexities of interpreting polygenic scores and > underappreciated obstacles to their broad use.

For my podcast, I recently talked to the first author of [Polygenic Prediction of Weight and Obesity Trajectories from Birth to Adulthood](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(19)30290-9.pdf). He turned out to be pretty sanguine about this result. We’re in the early years of the polygenic risk scores. There’s going to be a lot to learn…
