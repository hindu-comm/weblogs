For early modern Europe, Tim Blanning’s [The Pursuit of Glory: The Five Revolutions that Made Modern Europe: 1648-1815](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143113895/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=T99HvL7y.cNmVg.TW4Q7EQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=67TxncJrNOO11LKRkLbXog&slotNum=23&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is excellent. Read it!

One of the reasons I stay on Twitter is direct-messages (DMs). In many ways, it is superior to emails. But over the last few days, I’ve tried an experiment: **I’ve stopped Tweeting and responding to people.**

The DMs keep flowing. To be frank, this is a positive mental development. The public space on Twitter is dominated by self-righteous sociopaths. There’s no point in fighting because there are so few willing to step out and battle against sociopathic behavior, which is encouraged. This is endemic in political and journalistic Twitter, but it’s common on science-Twitter now as well.

It. is. done.

I’m going to start using [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:gnxp/) again for my [bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:gnxp/).

Podcast you should listen to this week, [Two Psychologists Four Beers](https://fourbeers.fireside.fm/22), with Brent Roberts.

I’m actually mildly excited about the Game of Thrones prequels since they are set so much earlier. Just enough familiarity to anchor, but not so much that there’s a connection between the earlier series and the newer one.
