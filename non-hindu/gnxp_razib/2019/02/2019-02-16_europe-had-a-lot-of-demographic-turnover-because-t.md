Europe had a lot of demographic turnover because there were never many humans

Now things are coming into focus. [Population dynamics and socio-spatial organization of the Aurignacian: Scalable quantitative demographic data for western and central Europe](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211562):

> Demographic estimates are presented for the Aurignacian techno-complex > (\~42,000 to 33,000 y calBP) and discussed in the context of > socio-spatial organization of hunter-gatherer populations. Results of > the analytical approach applied estimate a mean of 1,500 persons > (upper limit: 3,300; lower limit: 800) for western and central Europe. > The temporal and spatial analysis indicates an increase of the > population during the Aurignacian as well as marked regional > differences in population size and density. Demographic increase and > patterns of socio-spatial organization continue during the subsequent > early Gravettian period.

And the impact of both the later Gravettian and the Magdalenian seems to have been marginal. The primary “hunter-gatherer” contribution to modern Europeans is through a group which expanded after \~15,000 BC.

In any case, there are two things that I observe in relation to the population estimates above. First, they aren’t that unreasonable for a large mammal which isn’t much of a primary consumer of plants. Second, such a small and fragmented population indicates that extinction is always a possibility. You can take a standard conservation biological view and just assume statistically that small fragmented groups are likely to extinct over enough generations. Or, you can point out that genetically such small breeding populations (remember that the genetic breeding effective population is always smaller than the census population) are likely to build up deleterious alleles, and that’s probably going to result in a decrease of long term fitness.

The small populations during this period are not surprising. Many of the Neanderthal, Denisovan, and hunter-gatherer (e.g., the first [WHG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170574/) sample) populations had small sizes that led to homogeneity genetically and inbreeding. You see it in the homozygosity data and the runs of homozygosity. Ultimately, **it was the larger population sizes due to agriculture which changed things in a fundamental sense.**

This makes me wonder what was so advantageous about these marginal modern humans which allowed them to overwhelm and absorb the older Eurasian hominins?
