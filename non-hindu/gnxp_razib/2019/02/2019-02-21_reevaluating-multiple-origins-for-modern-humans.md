Reevaluating “multiple origins” for modern humans

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/600px-Multiregionaltheory.svg_.jpg?resize=300%2C310&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/600px-Multiregionaltheory.svg_.jpg?resize=300%2C310&ssl=1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans)Following up on the post below, [The Deep Origins Of East African Hunter-Gatherers](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/02/19/the-deep-origins-of-east-african-hunter-gatherers/), as well as some discussions on Twitter, I think I want to do some clarification about where I think we are now. My thoughts shouldn’t be a surprise if you have read everything I’ve said, but I may not have put them all together in one place.

Around the turn of the century, nearly twenty years ago, the consensus had definitively turned against a “multiregional” origin of modern humans, toward one where an “out of Africa” migration \~50,000 years ago was paramount. Many people took the “paramount” part and simply asserted that we are all Africans descended from a population that flourished in the east of the continent about 50,000 years ago. There was a lot of circumstantial evidence to support this, at least spottily, from both archaeology and genetics. There were also problems and lacunae in both fields. But the data was spotty enough that the extreme position was defensible.

We now have a lot more information and need to update our model. First, most people agree that indigenous Eurasian hominins, Neanderthals and Denisovans, contributed to the ancestry of people outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, it’s been evident for a long time now that the massive population bottleneck that is present in all non-African populations dating to \~50,000 years ago is far less evident in Sub-Saharan African genomes.

Finally, it’s pretty clear that humans with modern morphology were present within Africa for hundreds of thousands of years before the movement out of Africa.

Therefore, a new reevaluation of the old model that is converging is a **possibility** is that multi-regionalism was operative within Africa for hundreds of thousands of years, followed by a massive expansion on the northeast edge of Africa that resulted in most of the ancestry of other human groups outside of the continent, with some assimilation (e.g., Neanderthal). This is a far more complicated model than the older one, but sometimes the truth is more complicated than simplicity.

And, as a commenter on this weblog has pointed out, even the “deep lineages” within Africa, Y haplogroups A and B, show signs of massive expansion within the last 50,000 years.

The replacement of indigenous lineages was far more thorough outside of Africa, with 5% or less assimilation in most places. But, it probably impacted Africa as well. Though a larger fraction of diverged modern ancestry persisted in Africans than Eurasian hominin ancestry in non-Africans. In other words, the high genetic diversity of Africans today, and particular groups like the Khoisan, is due to the mixture between an ancient migration from the same population that was the source of “out of Africa” in Eurasia and Oceania, and disparate deeply structured lineages within Africa, that date back 200-400 thousand years ago.

Additionally, I think some earlier “modern” lineages were assimilated in eastern Asia with the latest migration out of Africa. And, some of the ancestry within Africa probably predates the origin of anatomically modern humans, analogous to the case of Neanderthals and Denisovans.

**Note:** This is not that different of a model from Dienekes Pontikos’ ideas in the 2000s, [More support for the Afrasian/Palaeoafrican hypothesis](https://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/04/more-support-for-afrasianpalaeoafrican_25.html), at the high level. Basically the more evidence has come in, the less crazy his model has gotten.
