Probably don’t watch this if you are hungry. It’s on Netflix.

The latest episode of [The Insight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) featured a [very long discussion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?mt=2) with [Jeffrey Rose](http://ronininstitute.org/research-scholars/jeffrey-rose/). If you are curious about the relationship of [southern Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhofar_Governorate) to the cultures of northeast Africa during the Middle Paleolithic, check it out!
