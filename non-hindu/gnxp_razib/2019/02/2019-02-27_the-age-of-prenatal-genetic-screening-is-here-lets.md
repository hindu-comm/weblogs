The age of prenatal genetic screening is here (let’s call it that!)

[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis). I haven’t thought much about the issue in the near ten years since then. Which in a personal sense certainly reflects my luck and circumstance.

But I’m thinking about the issue after reading this story from Emily Mullin, [We’re Already Designing Babies: Expanded genetic testing of embryos represents a new era of family planning. But how far should the technology go?](https://onezero.medium.com/were-already-designing-babies-3c853def0aa1):

> JJill Pinarowicz’s life has been shaped by a mutation in her mother’s DNA. The genetic error gave her two brothers a rare disease called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome…. >
> Both of Pinarowicz’s brothers passed away from complications of the disease. One died as a toddler, before she was born, and her other brother died at age 18, when Pinarowicz was a teenager. >
> Pinarowicz thought it would be too risky to have her own children…. >
> The technique is called preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). By using PGT together with in-vitro fertilization, Pinarowicz and her husband had a healthy son in May 2017.

An incredible “feel-good” outcome so far. And not surprising. I have become more conservative about technology since I first started writing on the internet in the early 2000s, **but I will *never* oppose these sorts of genetic technologies that allow couples whose offspring are at high risk of developing serious debilitating conditions to avoid these scenarios.** But the magnitude of how common this now took me aback:

> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in January that **PGT was used in 22 percent of IVF cases in 2016**, up from just 5 percent in the previous year.

The numbers for 2018 seem difficult to find, but it seems likely that [\~75,000 live-births per year in the USA are now due to IVF](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/million-babies-have-been-born-u-s-fertility-help-n752506). Worldwide there are in the range of 10 million humans alive today due to IVF.

How relevant IVF is to fertility varies by social and demographic variables. I know a fair number of people who have done IVF. The [average age](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html) of a mother **at her first** **birth** is 32 in San Francisco and 31 in Manhattan. As many of you probably know many options relating to fertility and genetic testing come “online” for American insurance companies at age 35.

When you transform blue-sky exotic basic science into mass technology **they become far less controversial**. One of the major themes of Carl Zimmer’s new book, [She Has Her Mother’s Laugh](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B075PVZRQ1/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=tCt4cMXGxqKFDcmZFeXVOg&slotNum=0&imprToken=cAMQmoY7ZuyPuYESoDhbFA&slotNum=28&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164), was the vocal and mainstream nature of 20th-century eugenics. A major [criticism](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06784-5) of Robert Plomin’s [Blueprint](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07K9KXVM5/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=5s5567WYYD4ci0IbmJ6Gvg&slotNum=0&imprToken=cAMQmoY7ZuyPuYESoDhbFA&slotNum=28&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164) is that it was resurrecting genetic determinism. Let me quote Mullin:

> In Iceland, for instance, the widespread availability of prenatal genetic testing has meant that nearly 100 percent of women choose to abort a fetus with Down syndrome, **which has led to a near eradication of babies being born with the condition**.

What is in a word? Something in the future is worrisome. Something that professional dual-income-no-kids couples do in their attempt to attain the classic bourgeois lifestyle is not so worthy of comment? Outside of the pro-life movement the discussion of the ubiquity of screening for Down syndrome seems rather muted, even though it is widespread. While we may furrow our brows over decisions made based on polygenic risk scores, the reality is that the age of Mendelian screening is here. It is not speculative science, but applied medicine.

Call it what you want to call it.
