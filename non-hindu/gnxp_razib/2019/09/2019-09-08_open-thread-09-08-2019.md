[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/horsewheellang.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691058873/geneexpressio-20)Since the [two recent papers](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/09/05/the-day-of-the-dasa/) on Indian genetics came out, lots of people have suggested that some of the researchers are shading the nature of the results to fit in with Indian politics. To be totally honest I haven’t said much about this because who are we, in the USA, to point fingers? American scientists on Twitter were outraged and offended that some researchers studied the genetic basis for predisposition to same-sex behavior **because of social and political *consequences***.

These are a minority. But the majority, on the whole, didn’t really engage, because they didn’t want to be put in the crosshairs of the militants.

Indian people are pretty interested in, and put a lot of stock in, their origins. Like American scientists, Indian scientists are serving the needs of their constituents. That’s what science is all about now I suppose. If you want the truth in a positivist sense, read the papers, and reanalyze the data. Don’t trust anyone, because they have their paymasters. I’ve been hearing more and more over the years American scientists talking about how they can make their science serve “social justice.” No surprise that scientists elsewhere will serve “Hindu rashtra” or whatever power they’re going to bend before.
