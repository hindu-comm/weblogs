Humans are basically invasive weeds

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/10kexplosion.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/10kexplosion.jpeg?resize=181%2C278&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0042FZRPC/geneexpressio-20)One of the somewhat surprising things we have learned over the last decade is that **massive admixture and homogenization has occurred between distinct human lineages over the last 10,000 years.** By this, I mean that we’re not talking simply about continuous gene-flow between neighboring populations, but massive expansions of small groups and assimilation of very different groups from the expanding groups. As a stylized fact, it looks like “Early European Farmers” we as distinct from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers as modern Northern Europeans are from Han Chinese (pairwise Fst \~0.10). The fusion of these two groups later merged in much of Europe with migrants from the east, the western edge of the forest-steppe.

The empirical pattern seems to be that cultural innovations (e.g., agriculture) trigger demographic revolutions, which homogenize and admix vast regions. This is a story of demographic history. Phylogeography.

Selection operates upon genetic variation, which is preexistent (“standing variation”), or, comes from new mutations (*de novo*).

It seems plausible that cultural innovation has resulted in a great deal of selection over the last 10,000 years. So where did the raw material come from? One argument that has been playing out is between those who argue that it’s from variation within human populations that is ancestral and shared, and new variation. This is where admixture comes into play.

A new preprint on bioRxiv uses the 1000 Genomes data in the New World to suggest that admixture resulted in the introduction of a lot of adaptive alleles into populations of mostly European and Native background from African ancestry. Basically, it seems likely that the American tropics were colonized by African tropical diseases, which entailed adaptations which were already existent within African populations. [Admixture-enabled selection for rapid adaptive evolution in the Americas](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/783845v1):

The period after 1492 is easy for us to think about. **But what ancient DNA has shown us is that it’s not as uncommon a phase as we might have thought.**
