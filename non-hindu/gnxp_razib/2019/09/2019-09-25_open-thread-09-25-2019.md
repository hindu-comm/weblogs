Bryan Ward-Perkins long ago convinced me in [The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192807285/geneexpressio-20) that the **material fall** of the Roman Empire was real and severe. But the “transformation” model a la [Peter Brown](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B9RJ89W/geneexpressio-20) seems more appropriate in regards to culture.

This is strange to me because I’m on the record as saying cultural change can be rapid and non-linear. But, a lot of the sort of books about the fall of antiquity in the face of Christianity seems to be channeling **modern** concerns and culture wars.

[Steppe Ancestry Reached Switzerland Before Germany; Implications For Etruscan Origins](https://dispatchesfromturtleisland.blogspot.com/2019/09/steppe-ancestry-reached-switzerland.html). For what it’s worth, I don’t know what says about Etruscan origins, who are as mysterious to me as they were 20 years ago.

[WeWork and Counterfeit Capitalism](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/wework-and-counterfeit-capitalism). Typical Matt Stoller take:

> From what I heard back in 2009, Dimon is a mediocrity who essentially got lucky his bank was too slow to get in on the subprime scam in 2006; he then used his bank’s incompetence at getting into the bubble as justification for how prudent he was.

I don’t think Dimon is dim as such. He just got lucky (and of course a lot of finance involves trading on insider information, which is less luck than cunning).

Also, literally every financial podcast where WeWork has come up over the last few years the hosts and guests start laughing and snickering.

[Premature Imitation and India’s Flailing State](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/09/premature-imitation-and-indias-flailing-state.html). Basically India’s elite has created (or is attempting to create) a regulatory bureaucracy fit for a developed country in an agrarian polity.

[Assortative mating and the dynamical decoupling of genetic admixture levels from phenotypes that differ between source populations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/773663v2). The title is intimidating, but this is a question a lot of you are interested in.

[A Crackdown on Islam Is Spreading Across China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/world/asia/china-islam-crackdown.html#click=https://t.co/fKV6pDYcyd). The Hui are more assimilable than the Uighur.

[Cheap exome sequencing](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/utah-genome-project/blog/2019/09/utah-bill.php) comes to Utah.

[Haplotype-based inference of the distribution of fitness effects](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/770966v1).

[Attacks Expose Flaws in Saudi Arabia’s Expensive Military](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/us/politics/saudi-military-iran.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share).
