Jürgen Osterhammel’s [Unfabling the East](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B077ZCGFMS/geneexpressio-20) is a book I really want to read someday. But I have to finish [The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth Century](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691169802/geneexpressio-20) first.

[Ancient genomic regulatory blocks are a major source for gene deserts in vertebrates after whole genome duplications](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/776369v1).

[What Whales and Dolphins Left Behind for Life in the Ocean](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/science/whales-dolphins-genes-evolution.html).

[U.S. Officials Warn of Rising Threat From Qaeda Branch in Northwest Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/world/middleeast/syria-qaeda-terrorism.html). Like Leftist terrorism in the 70s, this will linger for a while.

[Preying on Children: The Emerging Psychology of Pedophiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/us/pedophiles-online-sex-abuse.html). “The biological clues attached to pedophilia demonstrate that its roots are prenatal,” said James Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Center. “These are not genetic; they can be traced to specific periods of development in the womb.”

[“CCR5-∆32 is deleterious in the homozygous state in humans” – is it?](https://seanharrisonblog.com/2019/06/20/ccr5-%e2%88%8632-is-deleterious-in-the-homozygous-state-in-humans-is-it/). The paper that inspired this blog post will be retracted now, as some of the concerns expressed by the author of the post seem to have been warranted.

[Adaptive Tree Proposals for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/783597v1).

[Removing reference bias in ancient DNA data analysis by mapping to a sequence variation graph](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/782755v1).

[Is Yamnaya overrated?](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/09/is-yamnaya-overrated.html) I think a lot of the time these “ancestral” populations are just good proxies for the “true” ancestral group. That is, they are sister groups to the ancestral group. This is clear.

[“The Aryans”](https://logarithmichistory.wordpress.com/2019/09/22/the-aryans-5/).

ASHG 2019 meeting soon. Excited.
