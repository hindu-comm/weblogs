An Age of Miracles is Inevitable

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mormonamerica.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mormonamerica.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WJS9GQ/geneexpressio-20)Growing up with a lot of Mormons I was exposed to their culture a fair amount. Though Mormonism is really distinct as a culture, with folkways and mores (jello!), there are a lot of weird beliefs there too.

One of the arguments presented as supporting the validity of the religion is that the [Book of Mormon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0967686563/geneexpressio-20) is very extensive. How could we imagine that Joseph Smith, a relatively uneducated young man, could have written it by himself? It is such a long and detailed narrative. **The scripture is then evidence of divine provenance and inspiration.**

Now I have something more to say to that. In the context of the time and place, the [Second Great Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening) in greater New England, **it is not surprising** that some enterprising you man created a scripture that many would find convincing (at least convincing enough).\* The Mormons were the most successful of the new religious movements to come out of the northern United States during this period, but it was an extremely [culturally creative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening#Subgroups) time and place. If a new scripture was going to be created in the USA, this is when conditions were most ripe.

Indeed, I have argued [that something like Christianity](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/08/03/the-invention-of-world-religions-2000-years-ago/) was probably inevitable with the rise of Rome. There were broader historical-cultural forces at work. As I am not a believer in Christianity (or any religion), I don’t think that the unifying religion necessarily had to have all the particular features of Christianity, but Christianity clearly sufficed. The cultural victory of Christianity in the Roman Empire was unlikely in a specific sense, but someone was going to probably have a cultural victory.

Like Mormons, many Muslims assert the nature of the Koran is proof of Muhammad’s revelation. After all, he was an illiterate merchant. How could he have produced such work? Setting aside revisionism about the nature of the Koran (and Muhammad), there is a broader issue about the miraculous conquest of much of the Roman Empire, and all of the Persian Empire, in the 7th-century by the Arabs.

The magnitude and scale were clearly incredible.

**But was it truly that great of a surprise?** Historically peoples from the fringes and margins have been prominent in Near Eastern history in engaging in takeovers of older civilizations. Amorites, Kassites, Aramaeans, Medes, Persians, Parthians. Right before the rise of the Arabs, the Turks created a short-lived trans-Eurasians Empire, and after the decline of early Islam, the Mongols created another (and before the Mongols the Turks had become dominant within Islam after their adoption of the religion).

**[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/strange_parallel-1.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/strange_parallel-1.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003AT11FG/geneexpressio-20)**Scholars such as Peter Turchin, Christopher Beckwith, and Victor Lieberman have observed the relationship between the civilizational “marches” and “cores” over the past few thousand years (also see Ibn Khaldun). Over time the cores become inert, somnolescent, and they are conquered and revived by eruptions from the march. The Zhou, the first great Chinese dynasty which served as the cultural foundation for imperial China were semi-barbarized. The revival of the Chinese Empire under the Sui-Tang was spearheaded by semi-barbarized marchland elites as well. The Seleucid hegemony of the old Persian lands was wrested from their control by the Parthian Arsacids, who were of Central Asian [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire#Origins_and_establishment) (in contrast, the Sassanians came out of the old Persian heartland in the southwest). The Maurya focus of power was in Maghda, on the edge of Aryavarta.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/earlychina.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/earlychina.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00GA22L0E/geneexpressio-20)The Arab conquest was not surprising in the grand scope then. It was not inevitable, but neither was it entirely unlikely. In later centuries the Arab hegemony gave way to a Persian revival (e.g., the Buyids and Samanids), which gave way to Turkic hegemony. **The rare aspect of the Arabs is the creation of a new civilizational mythology and identity**. That is, Islam.

Of the peoples listed above, the only analog I can see here is the Zhou, who seem to have fused their own particularities (e.g., emphasizing the worship of an impersonal Heaven as opposed to a more personal Lord on High) with the broader matrix of late Shang proto-Chinese culture, and therefore created the identity we later think of as quintessentially Chinese. Though the roots of Han Chinese civilization do go back to the [Erlitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlitou_culture), 1,000 years before he Zhou, the broad outlines are Zhou.

xTo evaluate these unique, surprising, and novel events in history, **one always has to keep in mind the broad scope**. When seen across the patterns of history the individual perturbations are clearly part of the moving river of events, inexorable and directional.

\* I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the witnesses were involved in the creation of the [Book of Mormon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0967686563/geneexpressio-20).
