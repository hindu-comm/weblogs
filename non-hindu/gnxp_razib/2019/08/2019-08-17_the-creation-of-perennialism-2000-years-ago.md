The creation of perennialism 2,000 years ago

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lastpagansofrome.jpeg?resize=187%2C270&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lastpagansofrome.jpeg?resize=187%2C270&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005PUWWQK/geneexpressio-20)Today I recorded a podcast for [Rationally Speaking](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/about/). Julia Galef wanted to talk to me about my recent post, [Stuff I Was Wrong About!](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/08/05/stuff-i-was-wrong-about/). It was a long discussion, and I don’t know what will go into the final edit. But we did touch on this point from my post:

> …I believe that some sort of complex ethical religious system was > going to become dominant in the Roman Empire at some point. If Arbogast had won the Battle of Frigidus I think ultimately Christianity would still have become dominant within the empire (see the resistance to Buddhism in Tibet to envision a possible scenario).

The context here is that there is a tradition with the historiography which sees Theodosius the Great’s conquest of the Western Roman Empire from the usurper Eugenius, who was a puppet of the Frankish general Arbogast, as the final victory of Christianity as the state religion over the customary pagan cults. Though non-Christians, or people with strong non-Christian religious sympathies, were persistent as [public figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcellinus_(magister_militum)#Life) in the Roman world for decades, the last hope for state paganism seems to have ended with Theodosius’ victory.

Alan Cameron presents a mildly revisionist take in [The Last Pagans of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005PUWWQK/geneexpressio-20), arguing that state paganism was in sharp decline after the withdrawal of public subsidies decades before Theodosius’ victory. But that does not impact my general argument. The emergence of Julian the Apostate as emperor heading a counter-Christian movement in the early 360s, and varying degrees of toleration of non-Christian cults in the decades after, tells us that the rise of Christianity as the Roman state religion was a gradual affair that took decades.

Many people perceive that Constantine’s patronage of the Christian religion in the early 4th-century as analogous to Henry VIII changing the English Church from the Catholic to the Protestant camp.\* But this is not so. Though Constantine favored Christians, **the ruling class of the Roman state remained predominantly pagan for decades**.

There was no break with the pagan past. But a gradual evolution. Even though the Roman Empire had been ruled by Christian emperors for nearly two centuries, [Anastasius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasius_I_Dicorus) was still deified upon his death. Presumably, this was a customary honor which persisted, even though by the early 6th-century everyone understood this was a legacy of pagan emperor-cult.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final_pagan.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/final_pagan.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00Q6B7FXW/geneexpressio-20)With the gradual withdrawal of paganism’s hold on the landed aristocracy, the old cults declined as features of public culture due to lack of patronage. And, the eventual extinction of the tradition of philosophy also resulted in the intellectual death of elite paganism. By the early Dark Ages, paganism was associated with rustics and marginal peoples. Even if radical Protestants are correct that Europe’s people remained predominantly pagan their primitive beliefs and practices until the 16th-century, European political systems and elite culture were thoroughly Christian long before that.

Back to the original question: **is there a scenario where Christianity did not succeed in capturing the Roman state, and so becoming the Roman religion?** If Arbogast had won at the [Battle of Frigidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Frigidus) in 394, would paganism have revived in the Western Empire? Perhaps, but, I think Christianity had sunk roots too deeply into the matrix of Roman culture and society to be turned back. The fact that Arbogast’s puppet, Eugenius, was a nominal Christian illustrates the reality that even in the Western Empire, where many elite families had pagan sympathies, the head of state was now expected to be a Christian. **Christianity was the normative religion of the state**.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fate_of_rome.jpg?resize=199%2C300&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fate_of_rome.jpg?resize=199%2C300&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071SLPWVL/geneexpressio-20)We don’t know much about Arbogast. He was a Frank by origin, that is, a German. But the ancient sources indicate that Arbogast was a cultured individual, and assimilated into *Romanitas*. He was also a pagan, though from what I have read, one of the Greco-Roman variety, and not a devotee of Woden or any German god. There was likely an avenue of assimilation and integration whereby men from barbarian cultures could integrate into the high culture and society of old Rome during Late Antiquity, but we know little about it from Christian sources, who were likely not privy to such circles in any case.

If Arbogast had won at Frigidus and pushed forward a revival of the old pagan religion and Roman traditionalism through state patronage, some sort of short-term revival is likely. But a key issue to observe is that **we are not talking about the old religion which Augustus attempted to preserve.** The Roman religious culture was literally multicultural and very promiscuous. The 1st-century emperor Vespasian was a devotee of Isis, while the cult of*Sol Invictus* was popular in the 3rd-century. Roman religious traditions evolved and changed, and Kyle Harper suggests in [Fate of Rome](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071SLPWVL/geneexpressio-20) that pagan temple building decreased sharply after the Plague of Cyprian in the 260s. One interpretation might be that pagan religious practice itself was evolving in a less monumental and personal direction.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/download-10.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/download-10.jpeg?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B071D426ZR/geneexpressio-20)Anyone who takes an interest in early Christianity can observe that it evolves and mutates from its origins as a Jewish sect into something more elaborated in the 2nd-century. Very much a mystery religion of the gentiles. The life and thought of [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen) illustrate the nexus between Christians and the broader culture. But the influence did not go in a single direction. Not only did the currents of Roman society affect Christianity, **but the currents that led to Christianity shaped Roman society.** Prominent Jews were already associated with some of the Julio-Claudians, in particular, Gauis, but the penetration of Near Eastern sects into Roman society was high. Christianity was one of these new religious movements.

Just as Arbogast’s personal evolution as a man of Roman culture is hidden from us, so we perceive the cults of the Great Mother, Mithras, or Isis, darkly through a fog. They seem but shadows of the depth and richness that was early Christianity. And they may indeed have been such. But there is an alternative hypothesis: perhaps a large set of new religious movements were converging toward the same broad configuration, and Christianity was the one which won the race to the top, whether through chance or necessity.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bigGods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bigGods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20)And there was a necessity. In my post [The Invention Of World Religions 2,000 Years Ago](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/08/03/the-invention-of-world-religions-2000-years-ago/) I argue that “higher religions” evolved to fill a cultural niche that became very open with the rose of the Iron Age Empires. Rome, China, Persia, etc. The argument about whether “big gods” came before or after complex polities is a different one than the question I’m exploring here. Rather than “big gods,” **the imperial polities of the last few thousand years seem to need “big systems.”**

These systems can take various forms but share broad family features. One of the arguments made for the revival of paganism in the Roman Empire is that in the 9th-century Tang China suppressed the power of Buddhism at the cultural commanding heights. Though emperors could be personally devout Buddhists, the religion never obtained the same stature and monopoly power that Christianity or Islam did in western Eurasia. **What this analysis ignores though is that the arrival of Buddhism fundamentally transformed the Chinese religious landscape.** The development of complex religious Daoism was clearly due to Buddhist stimulus, while Neo-Confucianism took for granted many metaphysical presuppositions inherited from Buddhism. Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism in China began to operate as three legs of a religious stool.

**If “paganism” had revived in the Roman Empire, it would have had a heavily Christian flavor by the 5th-century.** The use of the word pagan in a non-pejorative sense is somewhat broad. Many Christians consider those outside of the Abrahamic tradition “pagans.” But there is a world of difference between Indian practitioners of Vedanta, and a Korean shaman. The latter is pagan in a way that is analogous to the [augurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur) of ancient Rome. Those who espouse Vedanta have views sharply at variance with Nicene Christianity, but their philosophical sophistication is no less than that of the heirs of [Basil of Caesarea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_of_Caesarea).

The Romans of the Republic practiced what we would today call a “tribal religion.” The similarities between [orisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orisha) and *numina* are not coincidental. The Romans of the Republic were a tribal people in a quite literal sense and worshipped gods of particular places. Though some of their elites were already cosmopolitan and Greek-educated, Roman religion and philosophy remained primitive. By 300 AD the situation was very different. Pagan Romans worshipped a variety of gods and adhered to many different cults, but **Neoplatonic philosophy added an intellectual sheen to the new paganism, introducing monism whereby all gods might be emanations from the Ultimate.** Christianity came out of the same milieu and was somewhat influenced by Neoplatonists, though Neoplatonists were some of the earliest intellectual critics of the religion, and the school remained the refuge for diehard pagans into the 6th-century.

Which brings us to perennialism. The [perennial philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy) is the idea that the world’s religious traditions share a single, metaphysical truth or origin. Unlike perennialists, I do not believe in a single metaphysical truth or origin. Rather, **I believe that particular social and cultural conditions 2,000 years ago made it very likely that a set of higher religions would emerge.** In particular, in large and complex multi-ethnic societies you need more than big gods. You needed big religions.

These higher religions always came with abstruse and complex philosophies opaque to the vast majority of adherents. But these elements were appealing to and justified the project of a large empire for religious professionals. A unitary principle, a Ground of Being, justified the necessity of a vice-reagent of God upon the earth, the son of Heaven, or the [Cakravartin](https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/cakravartin). Pre-modern states lacked the tools for genuine totalitarianism or the rapidity of unifying information technology. They required ideological bindings across their administrative classes. Philosophy injected into supernatural systems and then universalized provided just that.

These higher religions had localisms (e.g., Rome), but they were not fundamentally local. Priests and monks could travel across the world with some surety of safety due to the respect given to them by rulers. Rather than appealing to raw power or the capricious favor of household gods, **universal rulers could argue that their power was a reflection of the universal gods and universal principles.** Just as there was a God in heaven there was an emperor on earth. Karma and the Dharma applied to all peoples.

In evolutionary biology on occasion, there is a rhetorical question asked: why doesn’t evolution favor a single fit species? Why is there diversity? One explanation is that there are different adaptive niches, but even here there is no single species that occupies an adaptive niche across the whole world. Abiotic factors dictate certain parameters in terms of body-plan and behavior for numerous species. They are clearly being pushed and shaped by the same selective forces, but history is such that they are distinct and different.

And so it is with cultural evolution. I have observed that pagan and antique cults of Babylon existed in Mesopotamia in the early centuries of the Common Era. But by the 4th-century they faded and under the Sassanians Mesopotamia became dominated in its public culture by a welter of sects, Christian, Jewish, Gnostic, and Zoroastrian, with combinations thereof. This is important because unlike in the Roman Empire, the Sassanian Persians took a liberal attitude toward religious liberty. There was no coercive imposition of the new religions on the elites. Rather, **the elites adopted the new religions to integrate themselves into the Roman and Persian world**.

There were selective pressures that militated in favor of this transition. It wasn’t simply an accident of history. It was an inevitable consequence of social complexity.

\* I am aware that Henry VIII maintained a basically Catholic Church that had broken from Rome.
