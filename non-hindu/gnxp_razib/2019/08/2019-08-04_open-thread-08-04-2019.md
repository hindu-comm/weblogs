> …I have collected fifteen separate 400+ page books that try to answer > the question “why did the West get rich first.” And that was seven > years ago! The number of books tackling this question has only grown > larger. But if that is all you read, you are in trouble. How will you > know who is right and who is wrong?

There is no point reading > Diamond’s explanation for why China stagnated and why Europe did not > if you do not know anything about Chinese or European history yourself > (I am not convinced Diamond does). Grand theories of civilization should be at the bottom of your list. They are worth reading, **but not before you have the foundation in *facts* that you need to distinguish between the good work and the ill.**

This is good advice for history. It is a theory-poor data-rich field. And, as Tanner implies, **a knowledge of history is excellent as a tool for meta-cognition.**

Fields with lots of formal theory are such that instead of local empirical deep-dives, it’s more useful to pick up a survey of the broad frameworks so that you develop some intuitions about how to approach problems. [Principles of Population Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20) is what I recommend because it introduces you to a way of thinking about biology as a set of algebraic relations. After that, **you can engage with the literature**. In evolutionary and population genetics that means papers.

Today a friend emailed me about similarities he noticed between young men radicalized by the **logic** of Islamic fundamentalist and white nationalism. He himself at one point in his life had associations with Islamic fundamentalists. One thing I told him is the problem here is a certain type of young male is attracted to radical movements based on logic, but the vast majority of humans have no great investment in logic.

Profiles of [Salafi radicals from the 2000s](https://www.gnxp.com/blog/2005/07/profile-of-salafi-jihadists.php) noticed that at the elite and core groups there was an enrichment for engineers and scientists. Within Muslim subcultures, this is almost a caricature or stereotype.

Though I have never been religious myself, in my 20s I too was attracted to generalizing in this sort of way of thinking, though luckily never to the point of believing in the necessity of evil.

In my mid-20s reading cognitive anthropology “cured” me of this problem. Scott Atran’s [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195149300/geneexpressio-20) made me rethink everything I believed about religion.

The writer [Rod Dreher](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/) has talked about the contrast between himself and his sister and father when it comes to religion. Rod is a seeker and a thinker. Raised a Methodist, he became an atheist, and then converted to Roman Catholicism, and finally Eastern Orthodoxy. Dreher’s sister and father remained Methodist and were suspicious about his religious peregrinations. Though they did not reflect upon the fine points of faith or struggle with their beliefs, they were sincerely religious as a matter of custom, habit, and disposition.

The . reality is that for every Rod Dreher, there are hundreds of people like his sister and father.

If you take religion and turn it into a vessel for apodictic logic, it will blow up in your face. Conversely, I do wonder if some of the online “social justice” subcultures are at the opposite extreme, taking feeling, and making it the measure of all things.
