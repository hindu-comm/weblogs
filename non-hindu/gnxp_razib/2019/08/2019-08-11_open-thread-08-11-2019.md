[Cities](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871138980/geneexpressio-20) is not as good, but if you are trying to avoid cookie-cutter surveys, it is pretty decent. Reader is an engaging writer.

I looked up the median vs. mean wage for lawyers, and the skew was way more extreme than for physicians.
