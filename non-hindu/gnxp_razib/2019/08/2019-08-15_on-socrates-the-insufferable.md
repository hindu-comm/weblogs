On Socrates the insufferable

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_republic.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_republic.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CORRQHG/geneexpressio-20)I am trying to make a second go-around the whole audiobook thing. For whatever reason, I’m not very good at listening to books, as opposed to reading them. I’ve spent a lifetime reading, but am not the best listener. Books require concentrated attention across many sequences of ideas and thoughts, and I’m much better with text than audio when it comes to that.

But I’ve decided to try listening to Plato’s [The Republic](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CORRQHG/geneexpressio-20) while I’m exercising. I read portions of [The Republic](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01CORRQHG/geneexpressio-20) as an undergraduate, but the reality is so many of the concepts therein have been internalized and interpreted throughout Western culture that it’s not too difficult to follow the abstractions. I follow [Karl Popper](https://www.iep.utm.edu/popp-pol/) in taking a dim view of Plato’s influence on Western civilization, **but one cannot deny that influence**.\*

My biggest reaction listening so far (I’m 10% of the way in) is that Socrates is incredibly unpleasant. Though the sophist [Thrasymachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasymachus) is presented as something of a fool, his critique of Socrates’ schtick seems spot-on. I don’t recall finding Socrates so unpleasant when reading the text years ago. But listening to someone speaking in Socrates’ voice, his somewhat boorish nature comes through.

A final note, when encountering ancient philosophy at some level of depth at around the age of twenty, I was always struck by how modern their thinking was in many ways. Is that because they were like us? Or we are like them?

\* My anti-Plato partisanship is not strongly held. To some extent, Plato is at the root of much that is good and evil.
