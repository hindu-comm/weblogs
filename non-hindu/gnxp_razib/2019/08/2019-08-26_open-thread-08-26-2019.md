It just wasn’t working in terms of the time/energy it took to keep the tech working on an independent platform, and I didn’t really like gating posts anyway. If you really want to support this weblog, I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/razibkhan) account, but it’s pretty clear that I don’t write this blog for the money (though I make a non-trivial sum on Amazon referrals).

Honestly, who makes money on writing except for a few incumbents who are extracting rents (and perhaps people who write and ghost-write shlock like self-help and romance)?

I’ve canceled everyone’s recurring subscription. If you get charged again, just email me.

You might notice that I haven’t posted something since the last open thread. This happens really rarely. But the reality is I’ve been busy with stuff like family and doing work which actually makes me money. Happens. May happen more in the future, to be frank. If there is another Razib out there blogging about what I’m blogging about, tell me and I’ll retire from the field for sure!

Jerry Muller’s [Conservatism: An Anthology of Social and Political Thought From David Hume to the Present](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691037124/geneexpressio-20), which I read in the late 1990s, was the work which definitely shaped my alignment with the political Right. With that in mind, I thought I’d give his newest book, [The Tyranny of Metrics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07K458MZG/geneexpressio-20), a shot.

Some discussion on what’s been big in evolutionary biology in the last generation. My obviously biased thoughts:

> so what r big evolutionary things over last generation in your > opinion? spending 10 seconds on it i’d say >
> – comeback of natural selection on genome-wide scale >
> – exploring speciation dynamics using genomes >

I do post on Twitter now and then. But mostly I lurk. And, it’s sad to see so many people behave like 14-year olds. But I think it’s just a feature of the platform. End it, don’t mend it.

[The Rug Rat Race](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15284). Lyman Stone is disputing the data but this preprint argues that the current craze for full-court parenting dates to the mid-90s.

[Poll: Bernie, Warren surge to tie Biden atop Democratic field](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-poll-1475440). For what it’s worth, my money is on Warren. Though only modestly confident.

[Senescence: Still an Unsolved Problem of Biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/739730v1).

[How the 1619 Project Rehabilitates the ‘King Cotton’ Thesis](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/1619-project-new-york-times-king-cotton-thesis/). *The New York Times* took a minority and very tendentious position in economic history and presented it to the general public as if it was the mainstream consensus. Many liberal commentators are quite aware of this reality, and so when you listen to them comment on the series you see how they are engaging in circumlocutions. It’s sad. Also, the series is written like the United States of America is the only country with a history in the world, and that the world before 1619 did not exist.
