I think a lot of readers of this weblog would find this a useful book in terms of the range of topics covered, as well as the level of knowledge it expects. Definitely a good addition to your library. Recommended.

My guest appearance on [Rationally Speaking](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-238-razib-khan-on-stuff-ive-been-wrong-about.html) is live if you want to listen to me talk.

[ISIS Is Regaining Strength in Iraq and Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/isis-iraq-syria.html). We need to focus on containment.

[Seattle-area rents drop significantly for first time this decade as new apartments sit empty](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-area-rents-drop-significantly-for-first-time-this-decade-as-new-apartments-sit-empty/). Why? In the story: “The city of Seattle is getting more apartments this decade than in the prior 50 years combined.”

[In the Ethiopian Mountains, Ancient Humans Were Living the High Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/science/humans-high-altitude-ethiopia.html). The likelihood is that modern Ethiopian adaptations are old, and they got them through introgression.

[Considering founding and variable genomes is critical in studying polyploid evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/738229v1?rss=1).

[Ancient Burial Pits Reveal Sophisticated Rituals](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/science/lake-turkana-burials-pillars.html). This is a really cool find, and it looks like there are good possibilities for ancient DNA (look at the note in the supplements). Also, not surprised that environmental stress leads to new coordinated rituals.

When the spirit moves me, I write 1,000-3,000 word essays quite regularly. These posts have a “long-tale”…but I wonder, are they too long for regular readers?

It pushes all my content from blogs, like [Brown Pundits](https://www.brownpundits.com/), but also my writing for [National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/author/razib-khan/).

Just got a review copy of Thomas Chatterton Williams’ [Self-Portrait In Black and White](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07P9CQVPQ/geneexpressio-20). Won’t be out until the fall, but it looks really interesting.

The conversation below between Glenn Loury and John McWhorter on the defenestration of Roland Fryer is worth listening to.

On the whole, I lean toward their argument that considering the infractions Fryer committed, the reaction was disproportionate. But one thing that they mention offhand, and I have thought was truly part of the problem, is that since Fryer was a media darling in 2005 (see this [profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/magazine/toward-a-unified-theory-of-black-america.html) in *The New York Times Magazine*), he hasn’t really panned out as one of the tribunes of the Great Awokening. Combined with the fact that Glenn mentions Roland did not cultivate favor with the black academic community of Harvard, it strikes me that this incident is more a reflection of who/whom.
