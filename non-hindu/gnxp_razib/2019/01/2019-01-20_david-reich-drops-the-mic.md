David Reich drops the mic

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tenor.gif?resize=220%2C172&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tenor.gif?resize=220%2C172&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tenor.gif?ssl=1)**Update:** David Reich asks for [five corrections](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/five-corrections-new-york-times) to the piece in *The New York Times Magazine* piece.

Didn’t mean to post so much about that crappy piece in *The New York Tines Magazine*. But there’s so much tendentious crap in it. That being said,I am probably not going to post much more on this, because David Reich’s [response](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/letter-response-jan-17-article-new-york-times) is up:

> # Letter in response to Jan. 17 article in The New York Times >

> To the Editor: >
> GideonLewis-Kraus ([Jan. > 17](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/magazine/ancient-dna-paleogenomics.html)) > profiles the nascent field of ancient DNA, which in thelast few years > has contributed to a transformation in ourunderstanding of the > deephuman past. His article touches on important issues that we, as a > field, have yetto deal with fully: including how to handleancient > remains ethically and in away that preserves them for future > generations; how geneticists andarchaeologists can work in equal > partnershipsthat reflect true respect for theinsights of different disciplines; and how ancient DNA technology, which atpresent is applied efficiently only in largelabs, can be made accessible to awider group of scholars. >
> But Lewis-Kraus misunderstandsseveral basic issues. First, he > suggests that competition to publish is soextreme that standards > become relaxed. Asevidence, he cites a paper by my labthat was > accepted on appeal after initial rejection, and another that was reviewedrapidly. In fact, mechanisms forappeal and expedited review when journals feelthey are warranted are signs of healthy science, and both processes werecarried out rigorously. >
> Second, hecontends that ancient DNA specialists favor simplistic and > sweeping claims. Asevidence, he suggests that in 2015 I argued that > thepopulation of Europe was“almost entirely” replaced by people from > the Eastern European Steppe. On thecontrary, the paper he references > and indeedmy whole body of work argues forcomplex mixture, not > simple replacement. Lewis-Kraus also suggests that I claimedthat our > first study of thepeople of the Pacific island chain of Vanuatu > “conclusivelydemonstrated” no Papuan ancestry. But the paper in > question was crystal-clearthat thesepeople could have had some > Papuan ancestry – and indeed, to supporthis claim, Lewis-Kraus could only cite his own notes from an interview I gavehim long after I had published a second paper proving that there was indeed asmall proportion of Papuan ancestry. >
> Lewis-Krausalso suggests that I use small sample sizes to make > unjustifiable sweepingclaims. In fact, small sample sizes can be > definitive when theyyieldresults that are incompatible with > prevailing theories, as when mycolleagues and I described two samples > that proved the existence of theDenisovans, a previously undocumented > archaic human population. In mypapers, I am careful to only make > claims that can be supported by the dataI have. In small-sample size studies, I emphasize that more samples are neededto flesh out the details of the initial findings. A major focus of my labisgenerating the large data sets needed to do this. >
> Lewis-Kraus’s critiquesare based on incomplete facts and largely > anonymous sources whose motivations areimpossible to assess. > Curiously, he didnot ask me about the great majority ofhis concerns. > Had he done so, the evidence underlying his thesis that my workis > “indistinguishable from theracialized notions of the swashbuckling > imperialera” would have fallen apart. The truth, and the main theme > of my 2018[book](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/why-i-wrote-book)*Who > We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNAand the New Science of the > Human Past*, is exactly the opposite – namely, thatancient DNA > findings have renderedracist and colonialist narratives untenableby > showing that no human population is “pure” or unmixed. **It is > incumbent on scientiststo avoid advocating for simplistic theories, and instead to payattention toall available facts and come to nuanced conclusions. *The same holds true* forjournalists reporting on science.** >
