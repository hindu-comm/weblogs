On “big science”, ancient DNA, and David Reich

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whoweare.png?resize=183%2C276&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0)A lot has happened in the last few days in backchannel conversations and social media in relation to the piece in [The New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/magazine/ancient-dna-paleogenomics.html?action=click&module=Features&pgtype=Homepage) which put the spotlight on ancient DNA, and David Reich, for the general audience. Unlike [Carl Zimmer’s ancient DNA](https://www.nytimes.com/by/carl-zimmer) column in the science section of the paper, the people reading Gideon Lewis-Kraus’ 12,000-wordpiece are not going to be familiar with the field and will miss omissions and the context.

To “bullet” some of the issues with the piece, in order of simplicity and straightforwardness to me:

- **Sample size**: “A small sample,” she replied, “is only
  representative of itself.” This is a weak, though superficially valid,
  objection. Genome-wide analysis can yield thousands of markers out of
  a single individual. This is arguably far better than a few markers
  out of hundreds of individuals. The first “Western Hunter-Gatherer”
  and “Ancient North Eurasian” samples were representative of huge
  swaths of humanity. Later samples refined, rather than overturned,
  earlier suppositions. Humans may not be panmictic, but they mix over
  wide territories and undergo population expansion from small panmictic
  groups. For the granularity of questions being asked, representation
  is not a major issue. - **Peer-review was gamed**: “Even so, publication on successive days
  was apparently not a satisfactory outcome. On Feb. 19, Reich’s paper
  appeared in[preprint form on the
  web](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/19/268037), eight
  days before the Jena effort came out.” Labs compete to release results
  at the same time all the time. Peer-review is more of an art than a
  science. David Reich’s lab has produced a lot of high-quality papers,
  and a proven track record. The researchersare based out of Harvard.
  There are inequalities and biases that this introduces, but it’s not
  unique or special to the Reich lab. Additionally, one of the authors
  in this particular case [disputes
  details](https://twitter.com/pontus_skoglund/status/1086766380706336768)
  within the piece. To say that a paper is “unrejectable” is not a “good
  look,” but style is different than substance. - **Reviving discredited theories:** “Archaeologists, who feel as though
  they learned this lesson long ago, thus survey the rapid rise of
  ancient DNA with an overwhelming sense of déjà vu. By once again
  giving “migration” pride of place in the story of prehistory,
  paleogenomics has resurrected some old intellectual ghosts.”
  Geneticists who first saw evidence of discontinuity in the late 2000s
  were surprised. More primitive methods had suggested continuity, in
  particular, using contemporary allele frequencies and diversities as
  proxies for ancient dynamics. The problem is that there was an error
  in the premise: **population turnover *was* much more common in the
  past in a genetic sense than anyone had expected**. When these results
  first emerged*some*archeologists dismissed them (often making
  recourse to small sample sizes). Some continue to do so.
  Paleogeneticists currently exist in a theory-poor environment, rich in
  empirical results. They aren’t constructing grand narratives anew so
  much as reusing furniture to the best of their abilities. What
  archaeologists and anthropologists should be doing is constructing
  [richer
  frameworks](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/a-critique-of-ancient-dna-research-in-new-york-times/)
  consonant with the newest data, not griping that geneticists are
  discarding old theories that don’t fit with the data with older
  theories which are not congenial for various serious. In the comments,
  Doug Jones points out that some archaeologists long dismissed
  historical linguists, while an [anthropology blogger
  explains](https://culturologies.wordpress.com/2019/01/19/david-reich-and-the-new-york-times/)
  that the framing in*The New York Times* doesn’t really describe what
  happened in archaeology very well. - **The oligopoly:**Science is defined by the pareto principle. Most of
  the output is from a minority of researchers. The rich get richer.
  Places like Harvard, and the Broad Institute, have a host of people
  who are very bright, with diverse skills, and great resources. It is
  no surprise they produce at such a fast clip. Online one biologist
  suggested that “David Reich owned the field.” If you*just*readthe
  piece in*The New York Times* that’s what you might think, because
  [Eske Willerslev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eske_Willerslev) is
  not mentioned in it. That is either a huge oversight or a conscious
  aspect of narrative construction. Willerslev and Reich have been
  competing for years. All the problems of bigness associated with the
  Reich group probably apply to the Willerslev group. David Reich stands
  athwart the field of ancient human DNA (for non-humans, you might want
  to talk to people at UCSC), but the fact is that **much of science**
  is dominated by a few big laboratories. **This is *systemic* to
  science**, not ***particular*** to ancient DNA or David Reich. The
  piece tries to personalize something which is a framing issue across
  all of science (including in fields like archaeology). - **Field vs. field**: Much of the story pits archaeologists against the
  geneticists. From what I have heard (look to social media), this is
  misleading. Many archaeologists want to work with the Reich (or
  Willerslev or Krause) group. Additionally, the ancient DNA labs need
  the archaeologists. They’re the ones with the samples. And, David
  Reich is not the only player in this game. There were a lot of
  anonymous quotes in the piece. Frankly, I’ve heard similar things as
  these quotes, but often half in jest. - **Data acquisition and cultural sensitivities**: This is a big issue,
  and it is intertwined with normative considerations. Who “owns” a
  50,000-year-old subfossil? But the fact is that David Reich and his
  group are within the normal range of distribution in terms of how they
  work. Perhaps this is wrong, but again, then the problem is
  ***systemic***!

Of the various threads in the story, I think the issue with the scientific oligopoly in ancient DNA and relationships with indigenous peoples were the most above board. When it comes to the oligopoly, it’s just a fact of life. And it’s a fact of life widely in science. It has nothing to do with David Reich, but rather, the structure of science as a whole. If you want to go at Reich, you’ll have to go to a lot of prominent scientists. Myself, I think it’s a bit like the issue with Amazon. The service is very convenient for a consumer, but in the long-run is it best for our society that production and delivery are in the hands of only a few?

How one should handle samples, if one should take samples without total cultural consent, etc. is a **huge** issue, with lots of disagreements. Though the piece highlighted Vanuatu, much of the Reich lab (and others) work has been in places like Europe where this is not a major issue. In the near future, there will be work coming out of the Indian subcontinent, and controversy will emerge because geneticists are discovering things that will discomfit some Indian nationalists. In fact, Indian nationalists already cast aspersions at the Reich group (I get some conspiratorial emails now and then).

Finally, some may think that David Reich is a scary guy because of anonymous comments, implying he has the power to destroy careers. My personal experience with David Reich and people in his laboratory is that they are approachable and down to earth nerds. They are “wicked smart,” and some of them quite obviously know it (while others are very [British](https://twitter.com/mathiesoniain?lang=en)). But for a research group at the pinnacle of their subfield, they don’t hold themselves apart and above the rest of us plebs. **If you are interested in the research that David Reich’s group engages in, they will return your interest with open engagement.** Their goal isn’t to get rich, powerful, or even save the world. They just want to know stuff. A lot of stuff. Fast. In large quantity. Quibble with their means, but their ends are very transparent and clear.

If you want to “know” what David Reich is about, read his [book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B073NP8WT3/geneexpressio-20?creativeASIN=0974707759&linkCode=w61&imprToken=R8-wtTqOYzmrqBrfsNAUeA&slotNum=0). Or, read his [lab’s papers](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/publications). There are some bigshot professors who have colorful personalities that can fill up pages and pages of a profile. David Reich is not one of those. He is notable for his research. There are bigshot professors who pit their postdocs against each other in a Darwinian manner. Who schmooze with the great and powerful and have no time for the non-academic proles. David Reich is not one of those. He’s obviously not perfect. **But neither is he a puppet-master at the center of a grand scientific conspiracy.**
