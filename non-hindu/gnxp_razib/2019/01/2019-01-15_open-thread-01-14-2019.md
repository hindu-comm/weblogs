Fixed.

Robert Alter has a new translation of [The Hebrew Bible](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393292495/geneexpressio-20) out. I really like Alter’s work. In particular, [Genesis: Translation and Commentary](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039331670X/geneexpressio-20). But read all his stuff!

NPR has an [interview](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/14/684120470/after-24-years-scholar-completes-3-000-page-translation-of-the-hebrew-bible) with him up right now. He admits that he did the translation in longhand!

[Genome-wide association analyses of risk tolerance and risky behaviors in over 1 million individuals identify hundreds of loci and shared genetic influences](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0309-3).

[Changing environments and genetic variation: inbreeding does not compromise short-term physiological responses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/14/520015). At least in *Arabidopsis lyrata*.

[Saudi Woman Who Fled Home Embraces All Things Canadian. (O.K., Maybe Not Winter.)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/canada/rahaf-mohammed-alqunun-interview.html). Women in Saudi Arabia basically live in a form of slavery, in that they are somewhat the property of the paternal lineage.

[Almost all of the actresses who’ve played Cleopatra have been white. But was she?](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/14/18182744/cleopatra-white-actress-liz-taylor-angelina-jolie-lady-gaga) This is in *Vox*. There are some good writers at *Vox*, but they also produce click-bait for mildly above average IQ liberals. So I’m curious when articles like this come up how they justify giving their audience the conclusions they want.

At one point, the author says “The researchers believe Arsinoe’s remains, found in Ephesus, Turkey, indicate that her mother (also likely Cleopatra’s) was African.” The [link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/also_in_the_news/7945333.stm) goes to the BBC, and a 2009 article: “But remains of the queen’s sister Princess Arsinoe, found in Ephesus, Turkey, indicate that her mother had an ‘African’ skeleton….”‘ Looking even deeper, **I found the conclusions about Arsinoe’s mother comes from old measurements of the *skull*.** In other words, *Vox* is citing research on skull-shape which indicate African ancestry!

This is really weird. But I guess not surprising. A conclusion in search of an argument.

[Arab Christians clash violently with police in Haifa over ‘McJesus’ sculpture](https://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-christians-in-violent-clash-with-police-in-haifa-over-mcjesus-sculpture/). Honestly, not surprising that they got angry. Can you imagine if a McDonald’s had a depiction of Muhammad?

Skeptical of the thesis, but fascinated by empirical data.

Looks like [Quillette](https://quillette.com/) event in Toronto was a success. Several friends went, and asked if I was going, but alas, I’m a family man now and can’t just go jetting off to events at the last second! Lots of familiar faces to people who read this weblog in the photos….
