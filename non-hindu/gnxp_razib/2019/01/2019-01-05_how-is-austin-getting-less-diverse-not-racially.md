How is Austin getting less diverse? Not racially

One thing I see him saying is that Austin is less diverse. Since he’s lived there for many decades, he has some personal data to bring to the table. And yet I wasn’t sure that that was right.

The Census shows that Austin is **much more racially** diverse than a generation ago. So what’s going on? I think Wright is talking about socioeconomic diversity, in particular how Austin is getting priced out of the range of the musicians who bring positive externalities to the city.
