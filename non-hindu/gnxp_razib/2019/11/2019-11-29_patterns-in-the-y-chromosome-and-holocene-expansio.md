Patterns in the Y chromosome and Holocene expansion

That is, direct maternal and paternal lineages. The mtDNA and Y chromosomal phylogenies. Between the late 1990s and 2000s phylogenetic reconstructions of these lineages dominated historical population genetic inference.

Today with ancient DNA and genomewide SNP analysis, and now even whole-genome analysis, there isn’t nearly as much focus on Y and mtDNA. **But curiously in some ways, the scaffold of autosomal ancestry through ancient DNA allows for better leveraging of the insights of Y and mtDNA patterns.**

We now know that the Austro-Asiatic Munda people of northeast India are about 30% East Asian in their ancestry. But their dominant haplogroup, which connects them to East Asia, is present at 60% frequency. In contrast, their mtDNA is totally indistinguishable from their Indian neighbors.

One sees a similar dynamic among the Finnic people. These populations have high frequencies of a Siberian Y chromosomal haplogroup (\~60%), which seems to have arrived within the last 3,000 years. But the mitochondrial lineages are very similar to their neighbors (though there are a few stray East Eurasian mtDNA lineages). In fact, Finns and Sami are enriched for U5, which seems to be the dominant lineage of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Additionally, “non-European” (East Asian-like) ancestry in Finns is around in the 5-10% range and \~20% for the Sami. This seems quite lower than the frequency of N1c, the haplogroup in question, but a reasonable hypothesis is that the men who brought N1c were already quite mixed between eastern and western ancestry.

In any case, I want to close out this post with a quote which won’t surprise closer readers, [Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884158/):

In Europe and South Asia, this needs to be updated and modified. Late Neolithic and Bronze Age migrations clearly had a major impact. But what about East Asia?

Japan, for one, transformed in the recent past with the assimilation of post-Jomon people into the Yayoi 2,000 years ago. And the expansion of the Han entailed recent assimilations. But, perhaps there is no “star-shape” phylogeny because **these expansions were fundamentally bottom-up demographic expansions as posited by Bellwood.**
