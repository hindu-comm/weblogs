Paternity certainty is high in most human societies

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gr2ep.jpg?resize=499%2C260&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gr2ep.jpg?resize=499%2C260&ssl=1)](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31305-3)

A new paper in Current Biology reiterates what we know, [A Historical-Genetic Reconstruction of Human Extra-Pair Paternity](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31305-3):

The key thing to note that the 5.9% EPP rate is lower than the urban myth often promoted that 10% of children don’t realize the father raising them is not their biological father. The figure at the top illustrates the differences. You see that EPP is higher in low socioeconomic instances. The authors also found that higher density and urban areas were correlated with EPP.

Basically, prosperous farmers in less dense areas are the least likely to exhibit EPP. I think the Dutch study probably generalizes to most Eurasian societies. In particular, the male-dominated peasant societies that emerged in the last 10,000 years have likely been characterized by low EPP. Of course, there are societies with higher rates in the anthropological literature, but as noted in this paper those are societies characterized by more polyandry.
