[The Persianate World: The Frontiers of a Eurasian Lingua Franca](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07QJB1JKW/geneexpressio-20) is free on Kindle. It’s an open-access textbook. Though I’m not sure how many people are reading, I do think the distribution of intellectual production needs to be more widespread. This is easy in many of the sciences and social sciences, where papers are the primary way you contribute to the literature. More difficult in history where books matter more.

[CCR5-Δ32 is from Central Eurasia](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/11/interesting-times-ahead.html) (like a lot of things). It’s almost as if being on the margin and isolated isn’t beneficial to adaptation and innovation always.

[Saudi Aramco Announces Plans to Go Public](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/dealbook/aramco-ipo.html?action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage). It is interesting to me that Saudi Arabia has never allowed ARAMCO to be run incompetently. The ruling elite is not delusional, they know how their bread is buttered.

[A geostatistical approach to modelling human Holocene migrations in Europe using ancient DNA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/826149v1#disqus_thread). Looks like a lot of L. L. Cavalli-Sforza’s illustrations with synthetic maps are making a comeback (different method obviously).

[Adam Neumann and the Art of Failing Up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/business/adam-neumann-wework-exit-package.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

[Think Indians Are Mostly Non-Vegetarian, Or Only ‘Upper Castes’ Are Otherwise? This Menu Smriti Will Change Your Views](https://swarajyamag.com/culture/think-indians-are-mostly-non-vegetarian-or-only-upper-castes-are-otherwise-this-menu-smriti-will-change-your-views). Basically weekly meat consumption is a minority preference in India, and common mostly in West Bengal and Kerala.

[Why France is eyeing nuclear power again](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614579/why-france-is-eyeing-nuclear-power-again/).

[Characterisation of a second gain of function EDAR variant, encoding EDAR380R, in East Asia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/813063v1). The second variant though is not under selection.

[Dropshipping journalism](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/newsweek.php). The story of what’s happened at *Newsweek*. I think it speaks to the current moment in journalism.
