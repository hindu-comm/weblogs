[Creating Christian Marriage in Early Islamic Arabia](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/articles/2018/12/9/creating-christian-marriage-in-early-islamic-arabia):

I’m not a total revisionist. But not the date. 676. Contrary to traditional Islamic historiography I think it is highly plausible, even probably, that these men would not have been “Muslims” as we’d conceive of them. Rather, Islam, as we’d understand it really, makes sense only from 750 AD and later, with the emergence of the Sunni ulema, the turn against philosophy in mainstream Islam, and the focus on religious legalism. No [Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutub_al-Sittah), no Islam.

Some Hindus say that their religion is founded in the Vedas. Similarly, though traditional most Muslims (Shia and Sunni) ground their faith in customs and traditions which accrued organically in the centuries after the death of Muhammad, they will assert that the fundamental basis of their religion goes back to Muhammad and that Islam*qua*Islam exploded out of the deserts of Arabia under the [Rashidun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun).

From the perspective of the nonbeliever, I think both narratives miss important cultural genealogical features of the development of “Hinduism” and “Islam.” Hindus believe that their religion is the tradition of the Aryans. I hold that the Aryan, Indo-European, traditions that are present within Hinduism are calcified fossils, artifacts which symbolic meaning, but that the core of Dharmic traditions, whether Hindu or Buddhist or Jain, are not fundamentally from the Indo-Europeans. Some intellectual historians suggest that the Sramanic traditions, the counter-Hindu movements, are a revolt of the indigenous non-Aryan components. But I think the same is arguably true of Puranic Hinduism. **All of these religions are qualitatively different from the sacrificial ritualism of the pastoralist Aryans**.

Whereas proto-Islam under the Umayyads crystallized was the cult of the ruling caste, an Arab peculiarity, under the Abbasids, who saw the waxing of Iranian culture within the Caliphate, Islam became the religion of the state, and eventually the dominant element of the society. Though I would argue that the influence of Iran and Turan on Islam is probably quantitatively less than that of non-Aryan India on Hinduism, the transformation is great enough that I think one can make a similar case that Islam, a post-Christian Arab ruling sect, was “hijacked” by Iranian and Turanian modalities under the Abbasids.

Again, to be clear, I am not interested in “explaining” to Muslims or Hindus that “actually….” their religion isn’t what they think it is. I’m trying to get a better sense of cultural development and relatedness from the perspective of non-believers.

[Biotic interactions affect fitness across latitudes, but only drive local adaptation in the tropics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/575498v1). This surprised me at first blush.

A week ago I had a [conversation with Thomas Chatterton Williams](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/a-conversation-with-thomas-chatterton-williams-a-cosmopolitan-in-paris) for the [BrownCast](https://brownpundits.libsyn.com/). One thing that we both agreed on: **we hate Twitter, but we can’t leave it.** Also, lots of people on Twitter are very stupid. I used to think commenters on this blog were stupid, but the reality is that you are geniuses among the dull compared to the Twitter mobs.

[Why Elites Dislike Standardized Testing](https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/). The reality is that the gains to test-prep are not that great. ETS works *really* hard on this. But if you read Twitter or many mainstream commentators they act as if test-prep is driving the inequalities. It’s not. The world is full of bullshit.
