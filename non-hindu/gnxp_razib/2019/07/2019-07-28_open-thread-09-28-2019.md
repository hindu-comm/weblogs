It’s a novel set in an alternative history where the point-of-departure is that Archimedes does not die after the fall of Syracuse. For various reasons, this leads to an industrial revolution during the Late Republic.

I found out about this piece through Mark Koyama’s [Could Rome Have Had an Industrial Revolution?](https://medium.com/@MarkKoyama/could-rome-have-had-an-industrial-revolution-4126717370a2), a blog post on Medium.

A [blog about Indo-Europeans](https://indo-european.eu/).

David of Eurogenes suggests that [the recent paper on proto-Tocharians mixed up the Tocharians with the Huns](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/07/they-mixed-up-tocharians-with-huns.html). This is a post-publication review. I wouldn’t dismiss David’s judgment out of hand. I didn’t know what to think about the Tungusic affinities some of these people, and his model makes nice sense of that.

[Why Kenyans Make Such Great Runners: A Story of Genes and Cultures](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/why-kenyans-make-such-great-runners-a-story-of-genes-and-cultures/256015/). This is 2012 story in *The Atlantic* by [Max Fisher](https://twitter.com/Max_Fisher?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is pretty even-handed. I am skeptical *The Atlantic* would commission something like this today. Here’s the interesting point: “The researchers estimated that the average Kalenjin \[a Nilotic tribe in Kenya\] could outrun 90% of the global population.” If the average is so shifted from the median in this population the implications for the tails are pretty clear under normality (came on my radar when I saw [Jesse Singal](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1155049816428371970) tilting at windmills).

Old post [Tanner Greer](https://foreignpolicy.com/author/tanner/). I agree with it in broad strokes, **but always wonder how civilization can even be maintained outside of Western Europe!** Weirdly, the first time I was introduced to the role of the Catholic Church in destroying Roman family values was in Adam Bellow’s [In Praise of Nepotism](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FC1V1U/geneexpressio-20).

[Triceratops Skull, 65 Million Years Old, Unearthed by College Student, 23](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/science/triceratops-skull-65-million-years-old.html).

[They look white but say they’re black: a tiny town in Ohio wrestles with race](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/25/race-east-jackson-ohio-appalachia-white-black). Basically the culturally important role of hypodescent, and the eventual shedding of the norm in the present generation.

[A Prince’s \$500 Billion Desert Dream: Flying Cars, Robot Dinosaurs and a Giant Artificial Moon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-princes-500-billion-desert-dream-flying-cars-robot-dinosaurs-and-a-giant-artificial-moon-11564097568?mod=e2tw). A sad story. You give a fool billions, and everyone else plays the fool.

[Inside Chris Hughes’s campaign to break up Facebook, the tech ‘monopoly’ he helped create.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/inside-chris-hughess-campaign-break-up-facebook-tech-monopoly-he-helped-create/?utm_term=.27a9f4985141) Someone is going to write a bio of Chris Hughes with the title “The Opportunist.”

[Nepotism in the movies: it’s time to call out the acting school of mum and dad](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/24/nepotism-in-the-movies-its-time-to-call-out-the-acting-school-of-mum-and-dad). I think one reason people don’t care is the number of high paying acting jobs is so small this doesn’t affect most people. And you can only get so good-looking. With the rise of the CGI comic book film, this looks to be passing fad anyway.

[The Democratic Party Is Actually Three Parties](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/opinion/2020-progressive-candidates.html). On a private channel I’m on I stated that Ta-Nehisi Coates is so popular with white liberals in part because he is what white liberals would like all black Americans to be. Coates is an atheist who is socially liberal, as well as being black and oppressed.
