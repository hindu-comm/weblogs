Corporations without borders in a world with borders

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ascentofmoney.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ascentofmoney.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-collection/dp/B0018QQQKS/geneexpressio-20)So there has been some stuff in the media about the international element of American corporations. In particular, [Billionaire Peter Thiel to Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 3 questions on China that need answers](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/billionaire-peter-thiel-to-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-3-questions-on-china-that-need-answers). Thiel has been throwing broadsides at Google due to his participation in a conference on nationalism.

During the period of [Chimerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimerica), as documented in Niall Ferguson’s [The Ascent of Money](https://www.amazon.com/23andMe-DNA-Test-Ancestry-collection/dp/B0018QQQKS/geneexpressio-20), there was a sort of synergistic detente between the USA and China. That is obviously over. Part of it is Donald Trump’s stance, but there is a broader American suspicion, from the Left to the Right, toward the emergent muscularity of Chinese power abroad and its authoritarianism at home. Though it is clear that I am broadly sympathetic to many aspects of Chinese culture and happy that the average Chinese is wealthier and healthier than they were in the 20th-century, **it seems advisable for the American state to engage with the Chinese state in a wary manner.**

Which brings me to Thiel’s comments, and one aspect of the demographics of Silicon Valley which might be a major headache: [over 70% of employees are foreign-born](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/17/h-1b-foreign-citizens-make-up-nearly-three-quarters-of-silicon-valley-tech-workforce-report-says/). And many of these are Chinese nationals (over 50% of the [engineering workforce](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//static/pdf/Google_diversity_annual_report_2019.pdf) at Google in the USA is now “Asian”). Obviously, most of the Chinese nationals are not engaging in espionage. But the relationship between China and the USA is now shifting to one of rivalry, rather than partnership, so it’s going to put many of these employees in a strained position.
