Race, genetics, and geography

Interesting preprint, [Multiple Measures Reveal The Value of Both Race And Geographic Ancestry For Self-Identification](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701698v1):

> There is long-standing tension regarding whether and how to use race > or geographic ancestry in biomedical research. We examined multiple > self-reported measures of race and ancestry from a cohort of over > 100,000 U.S. residents alongside genetic data. We found that these > measures are often non-overlapping, and that no single self-reported > measure alone provides a better fit to genetic ancestry than a > combination including both race and geographic ancestry. We also found > that patterns of reporting for race and ancestry appear to be > influenced by participation in direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry > testing. **Our results demonstrate that there is a place for the language of both race and geographic ancestry as we seek to empower individuals to fully describe their family history in research and medicine.**

A combination of official racial categories and personal ancestry description seem to be the best predictor of genomic ancestry at the HLA loci. Second, **HLA loci variation is highly sensitive to genetic background.** It’s optimal to have more information, not less. This needs reiteration since I’m told some geneticists have been dismissing the need for self-reports of ethnicity.

In some ways, we haven’t moved that far beyond [Risch 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC139378/).

A minor gripe is that the preprint keeps mentioning supplements in the text body, but it’s not available for download (that I can see). Makes it harder to evaluate…

Also, the authors report that those who utilized direct-to-consumer personal genomics changed some opinions. For example, a smaller proportion of white individuals reported indigenous American ancestry, while a larger proportion of Hispanics reported indigenous American ancestry. Some of the authors work at Ancestry so not entirely surprising that it would present this stuff in a positive light, but would anyone complain about this?

**Update:** An author responds to [a few points](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/07/15/race-genetics-and-geography/#comments).
