The genetic discovery of France

In a nation of France’s size without strong socio-cultural dynamics that might encourage endogamy, it makes sense that geographic barriers are very important in structure. That being said, there does seem to be a correspondence between deep linguistic differences which date back to antiquity. Additionally, the people of Brittany turn out to be more “British” than not. This is not entirely surprising since the Breton dialect descends from the Brythonic language brought bystanders Celtic Britons (its closest relative is quasi-extinct Cornish).

I do wonder though how much France being a “target” nation for immigration over the centuries has shaped some of these patterns. I’m not talking here about recent non-European immigration, but the migration of Spaniards, Italians, and Poles, in the 19th-century, and earlier. Until the rise of Britain in the 18th-century France had been the largest, most powerful, and in the aggregate wealthiest, Western European nation in the post-Roman world. I suspect that this results in long-term trends toward cosmopolitanism genetically that might be absent in a few populations, such as the French Basque (who are distinct in these data).
