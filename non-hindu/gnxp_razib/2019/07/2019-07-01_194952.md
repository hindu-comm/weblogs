Veritas’ price drop to $599

For many years friends have been asking me whole genome sequencing retail would be “cheap.” Well, as Emily Mullin reports, Veritas is now dropping their retail price to \$599. [You Can Now Get Your Whole Genome Sequenced for Less Than an iPhone](https://onezero.medium.com/you-can-now-get-your-whole-genome-sequenced-for-less-than-an-iphone-a951e3d33f84):

But Veritas thinks its new price point will be low enough to convince customers that decoding their entire genome is worth it.

There are still some “gaps” in our knowledge in terms of repetitive areas, as well as the whole area of secondary and tertiary structure and details of gene regulation and epigenetics. But, we’re fast converging on total sequence information.
