Updating my knowledge base from when I was an elementary school kid.

I’m kind of tired of maintaining this site, so I have installed Jetpack, WP Rocket, and Cloudflare. Hopefully, this will keep the weblog from going down. If you have suggestions and tips, I’m game. On [GTMatrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.gnxp.com/scqx63ZP) a major issue is  
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js. But I don’t get why this is around as I removed the Twitter widget. Does anyone have an idea?

The second season of [The Insight](http://insitome.libsyn.com/) is done. Will be taking a short hiatus before season three. If you haven’t left a positive review on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-insight/id1324744423?ls=1&mt=2) or [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/insitome/the-insight), please do so.

Had a discussion with [Aziz Poonawalla](https://twitter.com/azizhp?lang=en) for my other podcast. Will probably go live after the 4th. We talked about the rise and fall of the blogosphere, and how not to make Twitter hell.

[‘Mormon’ No More: Faithful Reflect on Church’s Move to Scrap a Moniker](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/us/mormon-church-name-change.html?action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage). Interesting that the *post*-Mormon is the person who seems to be the most upset with the name change!

[SAGE: a comprehensive resource of genetic variants integrating South Asian whole genomes and exomes](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/bay080/5067958).

[The recent trend of ethnic intermarriage in China: an analysis based on the census data](https://journalofchinesesociology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40711-017-0059-0). Look in the data, and see that Hui intermarriage rates with Han are far higher than with Uyghur. The implication being that religion is less important than ethnicity/language.

[History Will Not Be Kind to Jony Ive](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywyjmw/history-will-not-be-kind-to-jony-ive). Basically, the move away from modularity increases aesthetic appeal but makes it more expensive and fragile.

[From drift to draft: How much do beneficial mutations actually contribute to predictions of Ohta’s slightly deleterious model of molecular evolution?](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/681866v1?rss=1)

[Say Goodnight Kevin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKvCiwesNEBLNioZfrB5mQ). This YouTube channel reviews Christian movies. The content creator is himself Christian and was homeschooled. But he’s also libertarian and a bit of a cynic. This is interesting anthropology.

[Identification of type 2 diabetes loci in 433,540 East Asian individuals](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/685172v1?rss=1).

[Classic and introgressed selective sweeps shape mimicry loci across a butterfly adaptive radiation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/685685v1?rss=1).

[Sexual selection does not increase the rate of compensatory adaptation to a mutation influencing a secondary sexual trait in Drosophila melanogaster](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/686741v1?rss=1).

[The origin of the Gravettians: genomic evidence from a 36,000-year-old Eastern European](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/685404v1?rss=1).

Beckwith rant alert.

By the way, if you haven’t read [Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004UGKKBE/geneexpressio-20/ref=as_at?imprToken=3SzvErsqk0uegISbc6B6.g&slotNum=0&imprToken=T99HvL7y.cNmVg.TW4Q7EQ&slotNum=0&imprToken=67TxncJrNOO11LKRkLbXog&slotNum=23&creativeASIN=0878933085&linkCode=w61&imprToken=QiG2bf7fc5-czG6VLZ9cSg&slotNum=164), read it.

[NIH probe of foreign ties has led to undisclosed firings—and refunds from institutions](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/nih-probe-foreign-ties-has-led-undisclosed-firings-and-refunds-institutions).

[Move over, DNA: ancient proteins are starting to reveal humanity’s history](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01986-x?sf214876037=1). In case you don’t know, I [interviewed](http://insitome.libsyn.com/tibetan-denisovans?tdest_id=660504) an author on the recent Tibetan Denisovan protein finding.
