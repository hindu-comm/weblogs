Denisovan dental morphology in East Asians and in the New World?

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/F1.large_.jpg?resize=300%2C363&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/F1.large_.jpg?resize=300%2C363&ssl=1)](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/02/1907557116)An interesting paper in *PNAS*, [Rare dental trait provides morphological evidence of archaic introgression in Asian fossil record](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/02/1907557116):

You need to look at the supplemental Excel table. This morphology is not unknown among Africans and Europeans, so there is a base rate, though the authors seem to indicate this can be attributed to novel mutation. I don’t understand why introgression is more likely (from Denisovans) than selection on standing variation?
