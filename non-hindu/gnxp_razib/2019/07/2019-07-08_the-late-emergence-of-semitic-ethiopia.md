But, I was curious today when a preprint dropped, [West Asian sources of the Eurasian component in Ethiopians: a reassessment](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/694299v1). This is out of Luca Pagani’s group, and it was he who published 2012’s [Ethiopian Genetic Diversity Reveals Linguistic Stratification and Complex Influences on the Ethiopian Gene Pool](https://www.google.com/search?q=pagani+ethiopia&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS817US817&oq=pagani+ethiopia&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.2253j1j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I spent a fair amount of time at his ASHG poster talking to him about his admixture estimate. He found which West Eurasian ancestry in Ethiopians (highland) which “may represent gene flow into Africa, which we estimate to have occurred ∼3 thousand years ago (kya).”

The West Eurasian ancestry into Ethiopians surprised no one. Rather, **the relatively recent estimate of admixture was surprising**. The Bible and Homer refer to “Ethiopians.” These mentions date to a period between 500 and 1000 BCE (even if the events predate that). My question was simple, “who were the Ethiopians mentioned by the Greeks and the Hebrews if the genetic character of the people who we today all Ethiopians only came into being \~3,000 years ago?”

Obviously, the term “Ethiopian” can be used in a more generic sense than for the people of Ethiopia proper. The Greeks confused Indians and Ethiopians because both were dark-skinned peoples, and presumably black African people of non-Ethiopian origin were sometimes identified as Ethiopian in Antiquity.

Let me quote the abstract of the preprint:

The big issue, which they acknowledge in their preprint, is that **assignment of ancestry to regions of the genome** can cause issues. They came to have checked for this, but I’m not sure they did. **One thing I did notice as well as the strong affinity to Middle Eastern groups with less recent cosmopolitan ancestry.**

Remember when ancient Egyptians shared a lot of drift with Sardinians? I think due to less cosmopolitan ancestry there is a tendency for ancient or endogamous groups to exhibit affinities. Additionally, the Minoans in the sample were mostly Anatolian Neolithic, with a secondary Caucasus drift component. **Perhaps the non-African in Ethiopians mimics this through different admixture pathway?**

But they are divided about in half between those who speak Semitic languages, and those who speak Cushitic languages. Semitic languages are well known, from Hebrew to Akkadian to Arabic. Interesting, the Ethiopian Semitic languages are [closer](http://individual.utoronto.ca/holmstedt/Welcome.html) to Hebrew and Arabic than the ancient East Semitic languages, such as Assyrian and Akkadian. The divergence of Akkadian from these other languages has to be older than 4,500 years ago since that’s the oldest Akkadian texts we have. The closest languages to the Ethiopian Semitic languages are South Arabian dialects, which are going extinct in the face the advance of Arabic.

All this needs to be interpreted in the context of the earlier paper.

If you look at the figure above, it aligns with the text. **There were several movements of pastoralists into East Africa from the north**. They began mixing with groups in Sudan 5 to 6 thousand years ago. Later on, they mixed with foragers to the south and east related to the Ethiopian Mota sample, and so resulting various savanna pastoralist groups. The [Iraqw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqw_people) people of Kenya and Tanzania likely descend from these early Afro-Asiatic pastoralists. They speak a Cushitic language. I think it is likely that these early pastoralists which pushed down the Nile valley were Cushitic speakers, and therefore related to those Afro-Asiatic people who pushed west and settled the Maghreb and became Berbers.

Over the last 2,000 years, it looks like most of these Savanna pastoralist people were absorbed into expanding Nilo-Saharan speaking peoples, such as the Masai, or to some extent into Bantu peoples, such as the Kikuyu (going bypassed the results in the paper). Meanwhile, at some point, much of Ethiopia seems to have been settled by Cushitic speakers, though likely later than in the regions to the west and south.

**I believe that the \~3,000-year date reported by Pagani et al. in 2012 is picking up a late admixture of Semitic peoples from Arabia with local Cushitic speakers**. The language affinities with South Arabian and later historical cross-Red Sea interactions points to Yemen.

Why is there this strange affinity to Minoans and Mediterranean Jews? Rather than indications of some pulse of gene flow from this particular region, I think it’s an artifact of the reality that Arabian populations are highly mixed and cosmopolitan today. This dates to the Islamic period, but probably earlier, as north and south Arabian peoples seem to have swapped locations regularly around the arid core of the peninsula.
