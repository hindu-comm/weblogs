Dante is [sequencing my whole genome](https://www.dantelabs.com/https://www.dantelabs.com/). As in, the process has begun! I will be posting a Dropbox link to the VCF file at a minimum since I promised I would post it if I had it done about ten years ago.

[Big deal of 2019: ancient DNA confirms the link between Y-haplogroup N and Uralic expansions](https://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/12/big-deal-of-2019-ancient-dna.html). Seems right.

[Kamala Harris aide bolts to Bloomberg campaign](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/27/kamala-harris-aide-bloomberg-campaign-074243). The whole thing is funny. I dislike Kamala’s authoritarian streak. Like Young Pompey.
