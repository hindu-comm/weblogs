Southeast Asia during the Eemian was a hominin paradise

[Last appearance of Homo erectus at Ngandong, Java, 117,000–108,000 years ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1863-2.epdf?referrer_access_token=6FmsHxmhSKJHEoKDpBJ6ttRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PL0aJGMjY0RlZwlYAadb4mXgRh8JI-Lu8lRhyL_HESbM2SYBqTKBe8Aj8dRV0OXarTapOEUIFZEvojIEj9WkQ2Ny3SdvTRpFMblVB9rOesWdaAXu_xNivreMnuzrPJijTAxPsa5SFc0Sl0Fo9L70rN7SwMhWYEcY3QcYtc78IR3ES9DllbtkEHoObORlTlEEtdkgiSBYmsLeXB21TrkthO1UCSX9NQiPEtmnM9kVp6FE8rnloXQZ90LC_MstteT7g4jS2CaY87pKyVi8Jn5q3N&tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com):

Paleoanthropologists that I follow on Twitter seem to find the dating creditable. I can’t evaluate it personally, so I’ll take that as a given.

It does seem likely though that Denisovans were still present when modern humans arrived, going by the latest genetic evidence, while [best dating of the “hobbits”](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/hobbit-was-separate-species-human-new-dating-reveals) of Flores suggests they went extinct only 60,000 years ago.

First, I would bet that various hominin groups were around after their last presence in the archaeological record. I now think there’s enough circumstantial evidence to suggest “modern” African-related/derived humans were present in and around southern and eastern Asia around \~100,000 years ago. There is evidence of [modern humans in Sumatra \~70,000 years ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23452). Also, there are signs of gene flow from modern humans [into Neanderthals](https://www.quantamagazine.org/fossil-dna-reveals-new-twists-in-modern-human-origins-20190829/) hundreds of thousands of years ago.

This is not terribly surprising. Southeast Asia is a relatively “protected” area of Eurasia, and so can serve as a refuge during inclement periods. And, during the Pleistocene, its surface was much more extensive. Sundaland covered the western third of modern Indonesia. Many of the prime habits are almost certainly underwater today.

But no strong evidence of “first wave” modern human ancestry. I think part of this is simply the reality that if there was mixture at low levels with earlier groups of modern humans in places like Southeast Asia one may not have the power to detect it well because the two lineages are not particularly distinct, as is the case with Neanderthals/Denisovans vs. modern humans.

I put “erectus” in quotations because what do we even mean by this? Was “erectus” really a coherent species for a million years in Southeast Asia? I doubt it. It’s more of a catchall and placeholder from what I can tell. Before the expansion of 50-60,000 years ago, the Eurasian landscape was much more diverse in terms of humans. Neanderthals seem to be relatively homogeneous, but Denisovans not so much, and I think the same would apply to various “erectus” groups. I bet that once some ancient DNA comes back from China we’ll see more than just Denisovans \~100,000 years ago.
