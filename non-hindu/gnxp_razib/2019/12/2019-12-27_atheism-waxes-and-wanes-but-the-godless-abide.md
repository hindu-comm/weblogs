Atheism waxes and wanes, but the godless abide

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_gods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_gods.jpeg?resize=182%2C277&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20)This weblog began in 2002. Back then the second Iraq War had not started, and the United States was in the throes of dealing with the 9/11 attack. There was a lot of discussion about Islam, and religion, in the public arena (there was a Bernard Lewis renaissance, and it seemed he was on Charlie Rose every other day).

In the 2000s I spent a fair amount of time thinking about and reading about religion. This was not a new thing for me. My family is Muslim, and I was raised in a very normatively conservative Christian region of the country. Though I can’t say I had deep theological conversations with friends, my atheist did come up now and then as it was not typical (for many people I had to explain what the word ‘atheism’ meant). In the 1990s I read a bit of Christian apologetics, older stuff like [Summa Theologica](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003T9V9A4/geneexpressio-20), and atheist works such as George H. Smith’s [Atheism: The Case Against God](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B018CH0N0O/geneexpressio-20) and Michael Martin’s [Atheism: A Philosophical Justification](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877229430/geneexpressio-20) (on the whole I think the older apologetics are actually more persuasive than the newer ones, but they are harder to parse for contemporary audiences).

Around 9/11 one would probably be accurate in pinning me as a proto-“New Atheist.” But with 9/11 I took a renewed interest in religion, and to be frank I found New Atheism to be unpersuasive. Reading Sam Harris’ [End of Faith](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393327655/geneexpressio-20) and Scott Atran’s [In Gods We Trust](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195178033/geneexpressio-20) in short order really sealed my own views.

As an adolescent, I had assumed that religion was to be found in sacred books. I believed this because coming from a Muslim family that is what we are taught, and my Christian friends also brandished books which they asserted were foundational, instrumental, and singular, in defining their faith. As a bookish person, this was entirely plausible to me that people would root their lives in books.

Rather than being ruled by reason, by reflection and analysis, they are ruled by emotion, custom, habit, and instinct. The specific contours of religious affiliation and identity are shaped by history, theologies, and liturgies which demarcate, but the roots of the religious sensibility, affinity, and intuition, are ancient and primal.

As an atheist, I do agree with the New Atheists about the God question. But, I profoundly disagree with them about human nature and religion. Religiosity is not the deviation from the straight path, irreligion is!

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/darwins_cathedral.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/darwins_cathedral.jpeg?resize=184%2C274&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226901351/geneexpressio-20)Since about 2006 or so, with exceptions, I have not focused much on the religion, evolution and psychology question. It did not seem to me that the cognitive anthropologists were making much empirical progress. I had come to the conclusions which inform my current views, and nothing more of interest seemed on the horizon.

Over the past few years, that has changed. The field of cultural evolution has now matured enough so that it’s own insights on religion as a phenomenon can add value. Though, to be fair, this did not come out of a vacuum. In the 2000s David Sloan Wilson wrote, which put forward a view that a functionalist understanding of religion as a cultural adaptation was a valuable paradigm. At the time I was skeptical. Now I am more open to this view, as other researchers have added more theoretical and empirical insight.

For decades there has been a line of thinking that religion is adaptive. That it serves particular functions in society or psychology. The authors of [Big Gods: How Religion Transformed Cooperation and Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EJJ30W8/geneexpressio-20) propose that religious phenomena are critical in understanding the emergence of social complexity over the last 10,000 years. There is [now a
debate](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2019/05/05/rumbles-in-religion-and-culture-evolution/) as to whether this is true or not using data within the cultural evolution community, but the key is that there is debate around data and theory, rather than interminable verbal volleys back and forth.

Not only may religion not be the “root of all evil,” but if some cultural evolutionists are correct religion is indispensable to the emergence of social complexity.

A cultural evolution perspective is important because there was always a lacuna within the cognitive anthropology perspective: **how to explain variation between societies in religiosity and the nature of religious expression**. Cognitive anthropologists had good arguments for why religious phenomena tended to canalize into certain directions (e.g., why gods are anthropomorphic more often than an essence, like water), but had poor explanations for why people were atheistic or why religiosity went up and down over time. A new preprint out of the cultural evolution perspective offers some answers, [The Origins of Religious Disbelief: A Dual Inheritance Approach](https://psyarxiv.com/e29rt/). The “dual” just means that **both** genes and culture matter.

Here is the abstract in full:

There is a lot presented in this paper. Overall, it’s good to have a pregistered large sample from the USA, but they need more cultures, and they are aware of this. But, it does seem in the USA the most important factor is broader local cultural attitudes toward religiosity and expressions of religion in public. A shorter way to say it is simple: **most people are sheeple.** In highly irreligious environments the modal person finds religious propositions uncredible on the face of it. Conversely, in highly religious environments atheistic propositions seem laughable. Just as most people’s religious beliefs don’t come about through deep reflection, most people’s irreligion doesn’t come about through deep reflection. It’s all part of a bigger process of social cognition, and religion in this way shares a lot of characteristics with politics and culture more broadly (do most people in rural Mississippi like country music as opposed to techno because of deep aesthetic judgments?).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/endoffaith.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gnxp.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/endoffaith.jpeg?resize=183%2C275&ssl=1)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393327655/geneexpressio-20)All that being said, they do see consistent results that deep analysis of religious questions correlate with atheism. But, this only applies in environments that are not so religious. In other words, the variation is exposed only in a particular environment.

Finally, there is a tendency of more “mind-blind” people to be more atheistic (a major prediction of the cognitive model), but it is a much smaller effect than the broad social impact of religious culture, broadly.

These results, on the whole, are not surprising, though I’m excited to have precise quantities to grapple with. When you summarize a whole society you may miss some details as well. Not only will future lines of research expand cross-culturally, but there will probably be insights sub-culturally.

There has been some work to show that religious intensity is moderately heritable. I would be curious to see follow-ups on this domain, and I do know that some people are working on finding the genomic predictors of religiosity as I write this.

If you have gotten to this part of the post, please read [The Origins of Religious Disbelief: A Dual Inheritance Approach](https://psyarxiv.com/e29rt/). It is well done!
