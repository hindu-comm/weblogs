Unlurk thread

This is a post for anyone who wants to “unlurk.” Comments and the “communal” aspects of weblogs have declined in this decade, but there still seems to be some “regulars” around here. Though unfortunately, the blog is old enough that I know some retirees that used to read are now no longer alive.
