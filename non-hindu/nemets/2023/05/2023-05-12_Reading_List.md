On Twitter, I am asked daily for reading recommendations. I hope this post helps point you in a good direction. I’ve read the deepest into prehistory and Eastern Europe/the Steppe, so here are some interesting books (bad reads have been left out):

**Prehistory**

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65f7cb89-9b0e-46d0-bbd3-019c4f006617_238x346.jpeg)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65f7cb89-9b0e-46d0-bbd3-019c4f006617_238x346.jpeg)

1.  “War Before Civilization” (1997) by Lawrence H. Keely is the best
    introduction to prehistory. Keely gives the reader an insight into
    the importance of violence in all societies and a sense of human
    nature. Second, it also lets the reader know that even rustic
    prehistoric societies were quite dynamic. Very readable.

2.  “The First Farmers of Europe” (2018) by Stephen Shennan. I regularly
    refer back to this as a reference guide for the “Early European
    Farmer” societies of the Neolithic that ruled much of Europe
    6200-2200 BC as well as their origin in Anatolia. It is a good
    source for comparisons between different farming societies as well,
    as well as on population growth in those societies. A bit outdated
    due to new ancient DNA finds, it holds up well.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F493f3dc5-b09c-4575-a59b-daa9c747df22_224x346.jpeg)

3.  “1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus” (2006) by
    Charles Mann. Right on some things (civilization in Amazonia), wrong
    on others (Caribbean population in the millions before Columbus),
    Mann’s book is a very good read not just for its information on
    Amerindian societies, but as a source of information on what other
    neolithic societies may have been like in the Old World.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93ef8ada-67f4-41cf-bf88-e4bd85cd99bf_150x231.jpeg)

4.  “Comanches: The History of a People” (1974) by T.R. Fehrenbach. An
    engaging read about one of our fiercest and most successful of
    enemies, and also useful as a reference for what a hunter-gatherer
    tribe turned horse-nomad empire could be.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F255f1a38-df96-4d4b-80fa-3dbbdc7e0c25_319x499.jpeg)

5.  “Ecological Imperialism” (1986) by Alfred Crosby. The better written
    predecessor of “Guns, Germs, and Steel”. Very important read on how
    European colonists changed ecologies of the regions they colonized,
    and why temperate areas like Australia and North America succumbed
    to colonists while other regions didn’t.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd98388f6-645f-4c91-890f-48ef08aaeadc_244x346.jpeg)

6.  “The Prehistory of 73+ Bantu Languages and Bantu Language Groups of
    Zambia 3000 BC to AD 1600” (2016) by Nicholas Katanekwa. Only book
    on the Bantu Expansion that I’ve read - good overview of the various
    migrations, even though doesn’t include recent DNA findings. What
    started off as an expansion of farmers turned into a series of
    conquests by iron-wielders.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F498f44d1-0a0c-411b-a726-544e9982c71c_350x499.jpeg)

7.  “The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages” (2002)
    by Lyudmila Koryakova and Andrey Epimahov. Part of the very useful
    Cambridge World Archaeology” series. The authors have a
    metal-centric view of prehistory, which is useful when considering
    the Indo-European and Uralic expansion. Very good reference for the
    Uralic expansion across the Urals into northern Europe.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F275ce1bd-fefa-4cb1-90d7-757cebf21cb1_325x500.jpeg)

8.  “Twilight of the Mammoths” (2005) by Paul Martin. It’s an okay read,
    dull bits about doing archaeological work with some interesting
    pieces about how megafauna extinction left a number of ecological
    niches empty.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88fe731b-4b34-449a-a821-e50941bfdd77_324x499.jpeg)

9.  “Plagues and Peoples” (1976) by William McNeill. Strongly recommend,
    even if outdated by more recent research into disease. Author has an
    interesting take on society from a disease’s perspective. He divides
    pressures on people as being from macroparasites (governments,
    warlords, etc) and microparasites (actual diseases). Changing
    ecologies - whether from climate or agriculture - changed the
    balances of parasitism. Also discusses how cities are population
    sinks - poorly fed urbanites in dense conditions die in droves of
    diseases, and have to be replenished from the countryside.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcd76d2d-19ad-464d-a1cc-94847d7f0653_329x499.jpeg)

10. “The Horse, The Wheel, and Language” (2007) by David Anthony. While
    outdated (this book was before most ancient DNA work and attributes
    the Indo-European expansion as a cultural and economic phenomenon),
    it is still the best archaeological reference for the
    Indo-Europeans.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc03c99a4-2ad9-4ed7-aa9b-93c226e442a3_474x680.jpeg)

11. “The Archaeology of the Caucasus” (2017) by Antonio Sagona. I
    constantly refer back to this very dense and difficult book. The
    Caucasus are notoriously diverse, and the origins of the peoples
    there are heavily disputed. Nonetheless, the region played an
    important role both in the rise and spread of civilization in the
    Middle East, as well as in the culture of the Indo-Europeans.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F484fbac3-d190-4c7a-8263-66abf2d9740e_606x900.jpeg)

12. “Tracing the Indo-Europeans” is a collection of essays on a number
    of Indo-European topics. Most of them are covered in “The Horse, the
    Wheel, and the Language”, but this has a much better description of
    the koryos war bands, ritual burial, and horse sacrifice. Also has a
    deeply intriguing theory (I don’t know how true it is, even the
    author seems uncertain) about the spread of yoga from India to
    Scandinavia in the Bronze Age.

Prehistory has been greatly illuminated by the ancient DNA finds of the last decade, and no book is up to date with them. These books should only be taken as an introduction to prehistory. David Reich’s book is supposed to be good as a summary of the DNA finds up to 2018, but I haven’t read it myself.

**Eastern Europe and the Eurasian Steppe**

1.  “A History of Ukraine” (1996) by Paul Magocsi. My personal favorite
    Ukrainian history, with a lot of great detail on the political and
    ethnic diversity in the region. It also presents a lot of evidence
    supporting cycles of population growth and colonization followed by
    mass die offs and societal collapse. Ukraine is very flat, and was
    very vulnerable to the predations of horse nomads for 5800 years.

2.  “The Northern Wars” (2000) by Robert Frost. Primarily a military
    organizational history, this book does discuss the demographics and
    internal structures of the state. It discusses how the Estonians and
    Baltic peoples endured their far stronger neighbors - the Poles,
    Germans, Swedes, and Russians were urbanites who repeatedly
    slaughtered each other while the rural Estonians and Balts hid in
    the countryside.

3.  “1812: Napoleon’s Fatal March on Moscow” (2012) by Adam Zamoyski.
    Zamoyski is an engaging writer, which made reading this a pleasure
    even if he is (understandably) Polish centric.

    [](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92836ef5-b1bd-41a8-b9a8-c1fea257dcd0_326x500.jpeg)

4.  “Setting the East Ablaze: Lenin's Dream of an Empire in Asia” (1984)
    by Peter Hopkirk. Fun read on Communist intrigues in China, India,
    and Central Asia in the 1920s and 1930s. Notably discusses M.N.
    Roy - founder of communist parties in both India and Mexico.

    Polish history

6.  “Warsaw 1920” (2008) by Adam Zamoyski. Quick read on the
    Polish-Soviet War. Has a background of Stalin’s rivalry with Trotsky
    and Tuhachevsky. However, takes Polish reports too credulously.

7.  “Lenin: A Biography” (2000) by Robert Service. One of the most
    boring books I’ve ever read. If you are interested in
    intra-socialist disputes you may find it interesting. It does have
    an amusing mention that the Russian Empire’s secret police supported
    Lenin as a man so unlikable that he could undermine the socialist
    movement.

8.  “Peter the Great: His Life and World” (1980) by Robert Massie.
    Massie views history as biography, and it shows in this book.
    Overdoes Peter’s anti-Christianity, but a fun read with a good
    discussion of the Battle of Poltava.

9.  “Russia's Steppe Frontier” (2002) by Michael Khodarkovsky (no
    relation to the similarly named oligarch). All societies found it
    difficult to include both cattle herders and farmers under the same
    government - Russia was no exception. This is a good read on how the
    Russians worked with and against the steppe peoples. The parts about
    the translators are particularly useful - there were few people
    bilingual in such combinations as Russian and Kalmyk, so translators
    ended up being important in their own right. They would have to
    translate treaties in such a manner as to please both parties, even
    if the translations contradicted each other.

10. “Russia in Flames” (2017) by Laura Engelstein. Useful read on the
    Russian Civil War from a woman sympathetic to the Constitutional
    Assembly and the Socialist Revolutionaries. Argues that Russian
    autocracy had stifled the development of civil society, and left a
    vacuum only a more total system could fill.

11. “Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman” (2011) by Robert Massie.
    Another history as biography, focusing on Catherine the Great’s
    private life over the policies of her government. Does make a
    convincing case that government by queen’s lover is quite capable.

12. “Medieval Russia, 980–1584” (2008) by Janet Martin. Good one volume
    summary of the medieval Russian states and rise of Moscow. However
    she tries unsuccessfully to find themes in Medieval Russian history
    where none exist. If you are looking for a deeper dive, Solovyov’s
    multivolume history is a better place to look. That being said, she
    draws on modern scholarship for certain important issues, such as
    the development of winter resistant rye in allowing Russian
    population to grow into the millions.

13. “The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union 1385-1569” (2015) by
    Robert Frost. Very detailed work on the gradual evolution of the
    union between Poland and Lithuania, as well as the internal politics
    of those two realms. The internal dynamics within the Grand Duchy of
    Lithuania (which included much of Belarus and Ukraine as well as
    Lithuania proper) are particularly relevant. The Orthodox Slavs
    under Lithuania were gradually absorbing their Lithuanian lords and
    favored Lithuanian independence from Poland. As union between Poland
    and Lithuania developed, the Orthodox Slavs caused problems.

14. “Bitter Choices” (2011) by Michael Khodarkovsky. Another history as
    biography, though of an obscure figure whose life the author uses to
    illuminate Russia’s 19th century wars in the North Caucasus. Solid
    and quick read.

15. “The Revolt of 1916 in Russian Central Asia” (1954) by Edward Sokol.
    First part of the book details the political and economic evolution
    of Central Asia in the decades preceding the rebellion, and are very
    useful.

16. “The 'Russian' Civil Wars, 1916-1926” (2015) by Jonathan Smele. My
    personal favorite English read on the Russian Civil War. While just
    a rough outline, Smele does a good job of covering all of the
    theaters. Conclusion makes the argument that Bolshevik victory was
    due to their totalitarian ideology allowing them to mobilize the
    (organization, communication, population, industrial, and
    bureaucratic) resources of the most developed part of Russia against
    the poorly connected periphery.

17. “Taming the Wild Field” (2004) by Willard Sunderland. Pre-modern
    Russia developed mostly north of the forest line, where the Orthodox
    Slavs could have some protection from horse nomad raiders. Much of
    the steppe was only colonized in the last 250 years. This book
    discusses that. Also has some interesting mentions of government
    marriage practices where bride kidnapping or assignment were used to
    increase population growth.

18. “The Baron's Cloak” (2014) by Willard Sunderland. Another history as
    biography, this time about the infamous Mad Baron of Mongolia, Roman
    von Ungern-Sternberg. Interesting read that covers the Baltic
    Germans and the interactions of the Mongol peoples and their Chinese
    rulers with the encroaching Russians. Outer Mongolia’s independence
    was by no means guaranteed, and it could have very easily suffered
    the same fate as East Turkestan, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia.

19. “Global Crisis” (2013) by Geoffrey Parker. Mostly on how the Little
    Ice Age caused a lot of problems across the world, but discusses
    Eastern Europe as well. Russia took most of Ukraine after famines
    drove the Ukrainians into a rebellion against the Poles.

20. “The Russian Revolution: A New History” (2017) by Sean McMeekin.
    Enjoyable and quick read on the two Russian Revolutions in 1917 and
    the Civil War. Author discusses the various personalities who
    intrigued to overthrow the Tsar, and how they underestimated the
    Bolsheviks.

21. “Russia and the Russians: A History” (2001) by Geoffrey Hosking. I
    read this book so long ago that I don’t remember anything specific
    about it, but skimming through it again it is a decent one volume
    overview of Russian history.

22. “Empires of the Silk Road” (2009) by Beckwith. Very good
    introduction to the steppe peoples and their importance in history,
    even if he exaggerates their influence (author believes Shang
    dynasty of Chinese was of Indo-European origin. I am doubtful, and
    his argument isn’t strong). Intriguingly suggests that Abbasid
    Revolution and An Lushan Rebellion were linked by Central Asians.

This post will be updated in the future, probably with useful ancient DNA papers.
