Due to continuing interest in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, I translated another book by one of the pro-Russian rebel leaders who was active in the Donbass in 2014. The first half of the book discusses the organization of the pro-Russian protests in the eastern Donetsk region as well as the author’s role in organizing the supplies of the rebellion after he was freed from prison. The second half discusses his ideology and dreams for the future.

With this completed, I will have time to write more posts on history in the future. I should have this for sale on Amazon shortly, but in the meantime wanted to provide the text for paid subscribers. Thank you immensely for your support.
