I’ve been dancing around some new themes that haven’t entirely come into focus (and might never), but I’ll try to pull some of it together in this post. I apologize for a pattern of putting out half-chewed perspectives, but that’s my meat-brain just doing its best.

I’ve written many lines admonishing [human supremacy](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-12-human-supremacy/), bashing [brains as limited organs](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/shortcut-brains/), and cautioning against aggrandizing notions of [transcendent consciousness](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/a-mind-blowing-leap/). I’ve praised the [genius of Life](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/mm-5-our-biological-inheritance/)—all the way “down” to microbes. I’ve called modernity various unflattering things: a [brain fart](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/11/political-perfection/); a [cancerous mode](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-14-cancer-diagnosis/) of living that has no long-term place on this planet; and most recently linked it to video-game style [virtual reality](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/02/virtual-reality/). Let’s see if I can manage some synthesis.

# Brain Obsession

First, why have I been fixated on brains lately? Besides obviously being a zombie—having cast off any claim to a soul (yet another brain-fabrication, after all)—consider these facts:

1.  Our brains endow us with uniquely powerful capabilities beyond those
    of other species—evidence abounds in the form of cities,
    spaceflight, and a host of other practices. 2.  It is easy to twist this undeniably-*exceptional* quality into one
    of *superiority/supremacy*. 3.  Brain worship pervades our culture; the entirely accurate term
    “meat-brain” is offensive to many; too few stress the limitations or
    downsides of brains. 4.  Brains are where mental models are made, and mental models are
    *guaranteed* to be incomplete accounts of the complex world. 5.  Modernity would not happen without exceptional brains, and since
    modernity operates like an ecological disease, turbo-brains bear
    significant responsibility—possibly for a sixth mass extinction.

Of course, I’m not the only one obsessed with brains. Modernity as a whole is too, but from a different, more fawning and self-flattering angle. Cultural teachings offer unwavering praise for our mental capacities, innovative potential, and transcendence above the “dumb” community of life.

# The Escape

The almost-inevitable result is that we tend to retreat into the commodious brain. We live in our heads. We take refuge. We construct virtual worlds disconnected from ecological reality, then treat those temporary fictional constructs as the *primary* reality—including [consciousness itself](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/a-mind-blowing-leap/). We appear to be the only animal that does this—at least so fully. As a consequence, we’ve lost touch with 95% of who we are—to the point that we don’t *actually* know what we’re doing, or how we fit in this world. We’re overthinking it. The answers won’t be manufactured in our disconnected brains: we need to take cues from the ([older and wiser](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/01/a-religion-of-life/)) more-than-human world.

Our level of mental awareness itself becomes a problem. We mistake this awareness for “us,” even though it’s just a small component of the whole. We turn our gift of awareness—grossly incomplete as it is—into a *soul*. While more than negligible, brains do not represent most of our mass, metabolism, or genetic coding. One way to see this is that we share one-third of an amoeba’s genes, or 60% of a banana’s. The brain is not a dominant piece, even though it seems that way to our overwhelmingly-biased brain-dwelling selves.

Not only do we place extreme emphasis on the brain as our defining feature, we also go all-in on mental constructs as defining ourselves. We may identify strongly with a nation, a religion, a profession, and/or even a sports team. We spend enormous amounts of time working in modernity-serving jobs to make money. All these things—nations, religions, money—are fictional and transitory fabrications by and for brains. Yet we mistake these artifices for “the world.”

Our constructs are increasingly detached from ecological reality. But just because ecological connections have been banished from our brains doesn’t mean they’ve gone away. Douglas Adams describes the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast as being so stupid that all you have to do to foil its intent to eat you is cover your eyes. It figures that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you. Putting this flawed logic ahead of direct sensory input is not actually too far from our complete devotion to the flawed logic of modernity: if we can’t see the primacy of ecological relationships, then: poof!—they may as well not exist. If we’ve come this far in an ever-increasing state of ecological ignorance, clearly we’re doing something right and can extend the same approach into a fantastic technological future. What hasn’t failed yet becomes, by definition, fail-proof.

Meanwhile, mounting pressures are poised to bite back, patiently and dispassionately dealing with a species living beyond long-term sustainability. Remember: *unsustainable* translates to *failure*, whose judgment is dispensed in the court of *ecology*.

# Other Ways of Knowing

We are so completely held captive by our own brains that the phrase “other ways of knowing” is alien and even nonsensical to us. The assumption is that knowing happens in brains, period. Any other form of “knowing” can’t be, you know, actual *knowing*, then, can it?

But brains are relative newcomers on the planet—especially the human model. For eons prior, lots of knowing was (and still *is*) going on. Electrons *know* they are attracted to protons. Two deuterium atoms fusing to helium at the sun’s center *know* that 2 + 2 = 4 (they get it right every single time, and it *matters*). But more to the point, Life *knows* how to operate, and perform feats that absolutely elude and baffle our brains. The community of life has other ways of knowing how to live that are time-tested and powerfully successful (i.e., sustainable). In fact, *we’re* the ones who are confused about how to live—because we have developed a staggering over-reliance on brains that are not constrained to run on an ecologically-wise operating system.

We dismiss other animals as dumb. Plants are even worse than dumb: mere vegetables! Because their ways of knowing aren’t cerebrally-based, our biased attitude is to discount them. A dumb moth is helplessly attracted to the porch light. A deer might stand transfixed in a road staring at an oncoming car’s headlights. While on lights, a sea turtle hatchling might mistake a streetlight for the moonlit ocean, and head the wrong way to its premature death. A bird might make its last flight straight into a window at full speed. A wide variety of animals fall victim to our traps: crabs, fish, mice, rabbits, and more. Not a single one is smart enough to use money or legally own property (though I’d call that *genius*). It’s easy to make fun when animals fail to “get with our program.”

Note that these examples introduce novel elements outside of an animal’s ecological (evolved) context. Within their context, they are absolute geniuses! Let’s try playing the reverse game: putting us outside our context and seeing how *we* like it.

To a bat, it’s hilarious that you could walk face-first into a brick wall in the dark. How utterly dumb! To a penguin, it’s inconceivable that you’d be too dense to pick out your own child among a wailing crowd of thousands simply by their cries. To a fish, not only are you capable of drowning in water of almost any depth, but you are oblivious to electrical impulses from the movements of predatory fish around you. To a dog, the fact that you can’t smell your way home makes you a total bonehead. Birds note that you’re so directionally-challenged that you are prone to walking in circles in woods or a fog—ignorant of the magnetic field that pervades their awareness. To an amoeba, your lack of ability to perceive chemical gradients is unthinkably insane. To a tree, it’s clear you don’t know the first thing about when its safe this year to put out leaf buds, or how to negotiate the delicacies of nutrient exchange with a mycorrhizal network. These plants and animals know a boatload of tricks, about which we haven’t the foggiest clue. The proof is in the pudding.

You see, brain-thought is only **one** of *many* ways to be clever and amazing. But it’s the one to which we assign primary—or even sole—value. Is it a coincidence that we elevate the feature at which we excel? We shamelessly toot our own horn, and then add insult to injury by using this feature that sets us a bit apart to amplify our apart-ness—unhelpfully. It’s the billionaire’s kid incapable of having a conversation without reminding you how much money they have and what that allows them to do. It’s no way to make the kind of friends that are worth having.

The examples above touch on “other ways of knowing.” Brains actually often get *in the way* of these more reliable, instinctual behaviors. But such instincts are not absent for us. We don’t learn to chew, swallow, walk, run, smile, laugh, or love by careful instruction. One window into this is when someone speaks of doing something “from the heart,” they’re really saying: “by means other than cerebral.” All life possesses deep wisdom in many forms, down to the molecular level—time-tested to survive as amazing beings.

# Breaking Captivity

I think the secret to escaping our cerebral escapism is to appreciate that brains are just *one* imperfect tool, and just *one* aspect of who we are. We can be grateful to have impressively-versatile headpieces, but also be aware of their limitations and—more importantly—their collateral dangers.

Just as an animal with razor-sharp teeth knows to be careful not to harm itself in grooming, or a hummingbird knows not to get stuck like a dart, or well-armed predators know to hold back during play, we might recognize our brains as lethal weapons capable of inflicting harm to ourselves and to the whole community of life, unwittingly. Without a deliberate check, our brains can turn us into a rogue species (modernity as a case in point).

Rather than retreating into the world of brains and their fancy constructs—responsible for initiating a sixth mass extinction that would wipe us out, too—we ought to break free of their grip. We need to recognize the artificial elements they create that put us [out of context](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-13-a-species-out-of-context/). Do we prioritize nation, money, religion, and other constructs? Or do we prioritize Life itself, and the ecological whole of which we are a lucky minority member? What do we fight for? Futile preservation of fictions (nations, money) or the community of life (ultimately the winning team)? This is a present concern right now as the U.S. government reels from an auto-immune attack on its own body. Is preservation of a destructive fantasy justified?

Most are satisfied living in their virtual realities—fighting to maintain transitory and harmful fabrications. Those are the invisible bars of our cage, as Daniel Quinn put it. To break free, we have to realize that it’s a stunt; a sham; a fiction; a cancer that has no lasting place. It comes out of our brains, which can be very wrong about how the world works—initialized in ignorance for having missed billions of years of painstaking preparation. I’m not saying we can drop modernity overnight. It will take generations, but ours can start the journey and pass the baton to those who follow.

What’s real, lasting, and will cradle us into the future if we don’t thwart it are biophysical realities, ecological interrelationships vetted by evolution, and community at many levels—including family, locals, and the more-than-human world.

### Postscript

Distrustful as I am of brain-products, I find myself internally reacting to ideas, concepts, proposals, or counter-arguments with something like “Oh yeah? Did that come out of your brain?” Aware of the “pot calling the kettle black” phenomenon, I might offer the following distinction or asymmetry. Yes, I also am availing myself of a brain, but—unusually—to advocate distrust of its products and looking beyond human mental constructions for guidance: physics, ecology, the community of life, etc. I find myself on familiar ground as a physicist: not *fabricating* the rules, but asking nature what rules it obeys, then being a powerless mouthpiece. This case is little different. It’s less about rank speculation and conjuring fancy feats of cognition than it is about listening carefully and downplaying mental constructs. Less mansplaining and more openness to the world beyond the brain—which turns out to be the vast majority of the universe. It’s about humility, and giving up the self-appointed title as masters of the planet.
