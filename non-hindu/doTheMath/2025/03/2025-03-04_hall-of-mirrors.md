The shock being experienced in Washington D.C. since January 20 is exposing gaping holes in the fantasies we told ourselves were rock-solid truths—lasting for whole (gasp) generations!. It is also important to admit that this is democracy working as intended: a popular majority said yes, and—let’s face it—might well do so again if a vote were held tomorrow.

Several of my recent posts have stressed the [virtual reality](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/02/virtual-reality/) aspects of modernity and our tendency to [take refuge](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/02/the-great-escape/) in flimsy mental models disconnected from biophysical and ecological reality. An earlier post cautioned against falling into the trap of aiming for [fantasy political perfection](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/11/political-perfection/). Here, we’ll look at the holes that are opening up.

As the Trump Administration rattles cages and turns things upside-down, I keep seeing headlines that effectively ask: “Is that even *legal*?”

Isn’t the mere fact that legal status is uncertain a glaring indicator that our legal system is little more than a bolus of small rocks held together by a few strands of spider web? No? Does that image fail to work for you: too random and specific? Whatever. You get the point.

# Trumping Reality

On the question of legality, the Trump Administration attitude is: “If you have to ask, then we’ll just say: yes—it’s legal when we do it. While you’re spinning wheels in legal mud, we’ll just go about irreversibly changing the country. Have fun!” The point is: no one really knows, because it’s all make-believe. That’s how empty-shirt our house-of-cards, Potemkin village of an artificial system is. Unlike a richly-woven ecology, it came out of meat-brains, hasn’t stood the test of time, and is *held together by spit*. That’s what my dear uncle would say about the Ferris wheels and other attractions that would roll into his small Georgia town overnight and set up in a parking lot (basically: “No, I’m not going to let you ride them.”). Our legal system reminds me of Ptolemaic epicycles: byzantine patches on patches; contrivances upon contrivances.

Judges are meant to rule on the legality of a matter, as if unambiguous. Notice that a judge never has enough intellectual integrity to say: indeterminate; can’t be decided; beyond the limits of the law or our mental facilities to decide. We agree to pretend that correct decisions are not only *possible*, but legitimate—when they’re often rather arbitrary.

The United States Supreme Court illustrates this very well, because a panel of nine judges weighs in on a matter, frequently splitting very predictably along ideological lines. What does that tell us? Interpretations of a manifestly imperfect artificial system will itself be manifestly imperfect and artificial. It is easy enough for clever people to weave a veil of fancy language to obscure the naked emperor. That’s a skill honed by college experience. Two can play the “originalist” game of literal interpretation of the Constitution to come up with diametrically-opposed opinions. It’s an emptiness that we pretend to be solid.

# Fiat Reality

This is a good example of what I have meant when I’ve said repeatedly that brain-derived constructs—grossly decontextualized from the myriad relationships comprising an ecology—will be essentially *guaranteed* to fail in the long term. Brain-farts rapidly lose their potency, on ecologically-relevant time scales.

In the present case, when a democratically-elected leader of the executive branch claims something is legal by fiat, and the legislative branch does not bother to clarify with new explicit band-aids (ahem, laws), and the court system rules—after many contradictory decisions, appeals, reversals, and delays—that the action is indeed declared to be legal, it shows that the whole system is one of fiat.

In fact, how could a currency, a nation-state, or a legal system be based on anything *but* fiat? These things were never anything more than rickety, notional constructs made strong only by collective agreement, acquiescence, or even apathy. We’re starting to learn how superficial and insubstantial the whole thing is (while being [existentially destructive](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/mm-7-ecological-nosedive/)). We stand in a hall of mirrors, admiring distorted reflections of distorted reflections—our sight-lines to the real external world eclipsed and re-routed by our superficially-imposed layers that we mistake for reality.

# The Pledge

I may as well use this space to offer a translation of the [Pledge of Allegiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance) in the U.S. For those unfamiliar, many states in the U.S. require school children to recite the pledge daily—generally standing with hand over heart (at one point the accompanying gesture [closely resembled a Nazi salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamy_salute)). The words are:

> I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and
> to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,
> indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Now my translation:

> I pledge fealty to a symbol of a fiction, and to the abstraction on
> which it floats, one *notion* under an imagined deity, indivisible
> because we say so, with detachment and unachievable ideals for select
> members of the human species only.

How we love a bit of theory! Delicious brain-work, without an iota of contact to ecological bedrock. Flyin’ high!

# Ultimate Court

In any case, if a government arbitrates that something is legal, what higher authority is recognized by said government to tell it otherwise? Of course, I know of an ultimate authority that will eventually pass judgment. No amount of “but I thought…” will matter. Our misguided notions are irrelevant: inconsequential shoe-squeaks in the larger dance.

The enormous and impressive display of plate-spinning that modernity puts on is manifestly unsustainable and will not be permitted to continue indefinitely. The plates will not keep spinning. Now, I would prefer an approach that calmly and deliberately sets each plate gently down over the coming decades (or centuries) with words of gratitude (a hospice gesture). The Trump approach may be closer to charging the stage, body-checking the plate-spinners, and smirking as plates crash and shatter all around. I can’t say I’m a fan of the approach, but neither can I pretend that the show was capable of going much longer—given how unsustainably-elaborate the spinning arrangements had become.

So, I ask the [newts](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/for-the-love-of-newts/) and the nesting chickadees what they think about the current government shenanigans. They possess a wisdom beyond my own, and I take a page from their indifference. However destructive and threatening to all Life, modernity is a brief flash, perhaps best [ignored](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-18-what-can-i-do/) by those who intend to stay for the long haul. Ride it out.
