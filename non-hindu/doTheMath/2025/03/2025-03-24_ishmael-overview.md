Ishmael Overview

<div class="wp-block-image">

![](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ishmael-book.jpg)

</div>

Have I [mentioned](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2023/08/call-me-ishmael/) how important I think Daniel Quinn’s *[Ishmael](https://www.ishmael.org/books/the-book/)* is? I reread it recently for the first time in a while, and was again impressed with how many important modernity-challenging ideas are packed into one novel.

I would dearly love everyone to read it. It’s not that I hold it to be flawless—to be treated as a divinely-inspired religious text. But it’s hard to think of a more powerful place to start for seeding incredibly important conversations and shifting awareness. It often transforms its readers, whether teenagers or retirees.

Options for reading the book include library access (also an audio version recently out), purchase (I recommend [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ishmael-daniel-quinn/11423360?ean=9780553375404&next=t), where go to an independent book shop of your choice), or a few sites ([1](https://archive.org/details/daniel-quinn-ishmael), [2](https://blackbooksdotpub.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ishmael-a-novel-by-daniel-quinn-z-lib.org_.pdf), [3](http://carbonfarm.us/555/ishmael-1-5.pdf)) that somehow make the text available. Being trapped behind a commercial “paywall” seems counter to the entire message of the book, which explicitly encourages sharing the message broadly.

I also suggest that you visit the site [ishmael.org](https://www.ishmael.org/) for more related content and [FAQ answers](https://www.ishmael.org/about/faq/) from Daniel Quinn (who died in 2018). A recent podcast series called [Human Nature Odyssey](https://sites.libsyn.com/505433), by Alex Leff, does a fantastic job of presenting key ideas from the book.

As a poor substitute for the entire book, what I’ll do is create a series here on [Do the Math](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/) that offers a relatively comprehensive version of the themes in the book. It won’t be as masterfully crafted as the actual book—but perhaps will be good enough to generate similar patterns of thought, and inspire greater readership of the original work.

# Structure

As I recently read the book again, I took notes that I deliberately kept to “one line” per numbered chapter subsection (for all but two sections that contained too many important ideas for one line). This “preview” post is built off of said notes, expanded beyond the initial one-liners to be full sentences. As such, it acts as a sort of expanded table of contents. The posts that follow this one will be broken into the thirteen chapters, released at an intended cadence of two per week.

It may be a mistake to put this preview (spoiler) up front, before the individual chapter posts, but that’s just how it’s going to be. It may work best if you have already read *Ishmael* and would like a lightning-fast reminder (also might serve as a decent reference for finding and re-reading sections of particular interest). You may wish to wait for the start of the full content in a couple days. For that matter, perhaps reading the original book is the best first step, using this resource as a compact review in years to come.

Some quick notes:

-   Page numbers in the chapter headings below refer to the original and
    25th anniversary editions, separated by a slash.
-   Each chapter is organized into numbered subsections, reflected in
    the numbered lists below.
-   I frequently use the term “modernity” as an easy label, but this
    word is not prominent (or even present?) in the book—which tends to
    use “Mother Culture” to represent the prevailing worldview.
-   Being over 30 years old, the book still uses the convention of
    “man,” which I tend to replace with “human” in my review.
-   Rare personal opinions/contributions are placed in \[square
    brackets\].
-   As individual chapters are featured in future posts, I will link
    them in the outline below for convenient access.

# [ONE (1/1)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/03/ishmael-chapter-1/)

Chapter One introduces the protagonist/narrator and the telepathic gorilla named Ishmael who is to be Alan’s teacher. While the narrator’s name is never revealed in this book, we learn it to be Alan Lomax in future works. For the purposes of this review, it is far easier to refer to him by name.

1.  Alan sees an ad in the paper by a teacher seeking students with an
    honest desire to save the world. The ad makes Alan angry, calling to
    mind youthful, naive fantasies about a better world. 2.  Alan’s curiosity drives him to learn what huckster/scheme is behind
    the ad, startled to find a large gorilla (who we later learn is
    named Ishmael) behind a glass wall in the otherwise empty Room 105
    in a shabby downtown building. He quickly discovers Ishmael’s
    telepathic communication capacity and uneasily settles in for
    Ishmael’s story. 3.  Ishmael recounts his earliest memories in a zoo, having been
    captured in the wild as an infant. He and other animals constantly
    asked: “Why, why, why” is life this way—there’s clearly something
    very wrong about it. He was transferred to a traveling menagerie,
    billed as the monster named Goliath. He slowly picked up language by
    close attention to the steady stream of visitors and
    children—starting with his oft-repeated name. A mysterious man
    turned up and pronounced him “not Goliath!” 4.  Ishmael was “thunderstruck” by being stripped of a name: now
    *nobody*! A few days later, he awakens in a secured gazebo on an
    estate lawn. The mysterious man appears again, this time pronouncing
    him to be Ishmael, to his great relief. The man is Walter Sokolow,
    who quickly learns of Ishmael’s comprehension of language.
    Excruciating failures at vocalization lead to a frustrated
    telepathic outburst/connection. Once Ishmael gets up to speed, the
    two begin researching together as colleagues. Sokolow marries a
    woman wholly displeased by Ishmael, and gives birth to a girl,
    Rachel. 5.  Rachel grows up tightly bonded to Ishmael. Sokolow dies, leaving
    Rachel as Ishmael’s protector. Ishmael eventually finds his calling
    as a teacher. 6.  Ishmael mentions four past pupils, labeling all as failed outcomes.
    He then reveals the subject in which he has particular insight as
    being **captivity**. This is relevant because modernity traps us in
    a destructive system. So immersive is this trap that we can’t find
    or even sense the bars of the cage. 7.  In explaining how he found his way to Ishmael, Alan recounts a
    school paper on a counterfactual Nazi future—many generations down
    the line when Aryans (alone) lived in all corners of the globe and
    the ugly history of how it had come about thoroughly expunged from
    cultural memory. One of the two characters in his story, Kurt,
    expresses an intangible feeling of having been lied to about
    something big, but could not identify just what. Alan feels
    similarly about our world, but doesn’t see what difference it could
    make to know the lie. Ishmael points out that if we could *all*
    sense the lie, we’d change \[what I call “[falling out of love with
    modernity](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-18-what-can-i-do/)“\]. 8.  The next morning, upon reflection, the entire encounter with a
    telepathic gorilla seemed like it may have been nothing more than a
    dream.

# [TWO (31/33)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/03/ishmael-chapter-2/)

The lessons begin. Note that the term “gods” is used in a figurative sense.

1.  Ishmael points out that the Germans of the 1930s were captives of a
    story. The cultural tide was too powerful to resist, even if you had
    problems with it. We, also, are captives of a story. 2.  Skeptical Germans had the option to flee Germany for similar
    cultures that were less crazed. But modernity affords no such
    escape. Ishmael warns Alan that acquiring this perspective/knowledge
    is isolating \[like taking the red pill\]. 3.  Vocabulary: Takers and Leavers replace the more loaded terms
    “civilized” and “primitive.” 4.  The aim is to discover our culture’s common story of how things came
    to be the way they are. The process will build a mosaic. The exact
    route/order is of secondary importance to the completed mosaic
    \[turn off the left-brain and let the right brain absorb a holistic
    picture, over time\]. 5.  More vocabulary: “A *story* is a scenario interrelating man, the
    world, and the gods”; “To *enact* a story is to live so as to make
    the story a reality”; “A *culture* is people enacting a story.”
    Leavers and Takers are enacting completely different stories, the
    latter one leading toward catastrophe. 6.  It is **not** accurate to say that Leavers represent Chapter 1 of a
    story and Takers Chapter 2 of the same story. These are
    **different**, *parallel* stories overlapping each other in time on
    the same planet. 7.  Ishmael’s assignment to Alan: find modernity’s story—the one that
    “Mother Culture” incessantly whispers in our ears. What is the
    mythology shared by our culture? Alan is incredulous—rejecting the
    notion that we are primitive enough to subscribe to a *mythology* of
    *any* sort. The idea is laughably ridiculous.

# [THREE (47/51)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-3/)

Ishmael extracts the story’s beginning out of Alan, as if reluctant teeth.

1.  Ishmael provides a tape recorder to capture Alan’s story. To make
    the task more tractable, Ishmael recommends starting just with the
    story’s beginning (saving the middle and end for later). Alan swears
    there will be no mythology in it. 2.  Alan recounts the standard (approximate; broad-brush) tale of
    cosmology, geology, and evolution, ending up at humans. Ishmael asks
    Alan to identify the mythological aspect, but Alan simply can’t spot
    anything mythological about it: purely factual and science-based. 3.  Ishmael offers a parable: a similar account from a jellyfish 500 Myr
    ago. The jellyfish account ends with the triumphant arrival of
    jellyfish on Earth. 4.  Alan offers heavy and sustained resistance in accepting the
    mythological nature of his story’s culminating in the arrival of
    humans, but admits it in the end, through bared teeth. 5.  Our standard story, though baked with factual ingredients, spins
    Earth as being made (by the “gods”) *just for humans*, and this
    unspoken assumption is of great importance in our culture. 6.  Our story’s premise: **the world was made for us, and therefore
    *belongs* to us**. We can do with it whatever we wish. We speak of
    *our* planet, *our* environment, and even *our* wildlife. That’s
    mythology. 7.  So, if the planet belongs to humans, why are things messed up? Alan
    suggests it’s because the gods made a mistake in designing Earth for
    humans (rather than, say, for jellyfish). 8.  Alan’s assignment: come up with the middle part of the story. Alan
    predicts it will mimic the style of a *Nova* show.

# [FOUR (65/69)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-4/)

The middle of the story comes out. Keep in mind, these are not Ishmael’s teachings, but an account of the story we tell ourselves in the culture of modernity.

1.  Humans wasted millions of years living like animals. But that’s not
    how humans were *meant* to be. Humans could only realize their
    greatness if they formed settlements and got to work building
    civilization. To do this, they first needed to grow food: no more
    living at the whims of what the gods provide. 2.  Our destiny was not to live like the lion or the wombat. Ishmael
    presses: what *is* human destiny—in the mythological sense? 3.  Alan’s story goes that without man, the world was a dangerous,
    chaotic place: a wild, untamed jungle. It needed a ruler to set
    things straight. By this time, Alan is much quicker to recognize a
    mythology when he hears one coming out of his mouth: it is in no way
    a *fact* that Earth required a ruling species. 4.  The trouble is: the world did not meekly succumb to human ambitions
    to rule. Nature resisted our attempts at control, constantly
    thwarting our efforts and schemes in every possible way. Therefore,
    the ruler must **conquer** the wild. This attitude is pervasive in
    our society: we hear it daily, in myriad, inexplicit undertones. 5.  The damages accrued are just the price of fulfilling our
    unquestioned destiny. There’s no real choice: enacting a story where
    humans are **at war with the world** (as if an enemy) is *going* to
    be damaging.

# [FIVE (77/81)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-5/)

Alan finishes out the end of the story—via substantial prompting, as usual.

1.  What does the future hold? Well, admittedly, it’s going sideways.
    We’re at great risk of failure/collapse. Thus, we need to re-double
    our efforts and achieve *perfect* mastery of the planet to realize
    the paradise that Earth was meant to be in our competent hands. 2.  Ishmael notes that the sense of peril is relatively new: mere
    decades ago the prevailing assumption was that “things were just
    going to go on getting better and better and better.” So, sure,
    humans were destined to rule this eventual paradise, but there’s a
    fly in the ointment: humans are *intrinsically flawed*, and thus
    always screw up the grand plans. 3.  This perspective that humans are intrinsically flawed is part of our
    cultural history spanning millennia, but is largely limited to Taker
    mythology (i.e., the premise of modernity). Humans need not be that
    way. 4.  Takers have a habit of relying on prophets to tell us how to live.
    Ishmael points out that these notions come from “the insides of your
    heads”
    \[[meat-brains](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/shortcut-brains/)\].
    Takers are convinced that it is impossible to find guidance from the
    “external” universe relevant as to how humans should live. 5.  Ishmael draws a connection between the Taker-assumed fundamental
    flaw in humans and the observation that Takers don’t know how to
    live. Maybe, in fact, that *is* the flaw. 6.  It amounts to a sad, desperate story: humans are fundamentally
    flawed, will never know the one right way to live, and are thus
    doomed to screw up. Yuck. Is there another story to be in? 7.  Ishmael notes that he has been exposing connections hidden in plain
    sight—like tourist attractions that locals don’t even notice
    anymore. The next step is to find information on how humans ought to
    live, which Alan insists is not available.

# [SIX (93/97)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-6/)

In search of the Law of Life…

1.  We don’t need prophets \[and their meat-brains\] to tell us how to
    live: we can consult *what’s actually there*. An analogy is
    constructed to the role of aerodynamic laws in understanding how one
    might fly: discoverable by observing interactions of air and
    objects. Alan is still certain that one cannot discover
    (non-existent) laws on how to live. 2.  Ishmael points out that humans are not exempt from the law of
    gravity. Where ought one look to find the Law of Life? Try the
    community of life! An aspiring aeronaut who wants to stay aloft
    would benefit from acquaintance with the laws of gravity and
    aerodynamics, thus: “when you’re on the brink of extinction and want
    to live for a while longer, the laws governing life might
    conceivably become relevant.” 3.  Just as gravity keeps the Earth, solar system, and galaxy
    together/organized, so too does the Law of Life keep the community
    of life together. Yes, biologists know all about the relevant
    *phenomena*, but culture prevents scientists—like everyone else—from
    identifying a universal *law*, since the conviction is that any such
    law would not apply to humans, and thus not be a law. 4.  The Law of Life *will indeed* apply to humans. Yet, our culture
    insists that humans are exempt; unique; transcendent; apart from
    nature. 5.  The gods have played three dirty tricks on the Takers that are tough
    pills to swallow: 1) the Copernican Revolution revoked Earth’s
    status as the center of the cosmos (begrudgingly accepted not that
    long ago); 2) Darwinian evolution indicated that we emerged from the
    ignominious slime rather than being delivered by divine means (still
    new, barely accepted); and 3) humans are not exempt from the Law of
    Life (not yet accepted or even discussed). The only way to live
    long-term is to comply with the Law; else we go extinct. 6.  Ishmael offers a story of a flying contraption that is not built on
    principles of sustainable aerodynamic flight. Ignorance of the law
    offers no protection from it. Just as the plummeting pilot sees
    wrecks of other failed attempts below, we see ruins of fallen
    civilizations that failed to comply with the Law of Life. We now see
    the ground rushing toward us. Our cultural “flying”
    contraption—called the Taker Thunderbolt—is a death trap.

# [SEVEN (111/117)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-7/)

The Law of Life continues to elude Alan.

1.  Ishmael tells of a culture of C people who eat B people, who eat A
    people, who eat C people. No one ever violates the law, but how
    would you discover the law in operation without observing
    violations? Where would you look? 2.  Nature is not at war. The Law of Life is a peace-keeping law. Humans
    lived by this law for millions of years. The Takers’ violation is a
    recent phenomenon, demonstrably *not* a fundamental human flaw baked
    into our DNA. 3.  Ishmael to Alan: Go away and come back when you can tell me the Law
    that has been at work from the very beginning in the community of
    life. 4.  Alan felt depressed, rejected, and realized his time with Ishmael
    would someday come to an end. He wanted a teacher for life.

# [EIGHT (123/129)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-8/)

Alan works out the Law of Life. Finally. But could I have done it?

1.  Takers eliminate their competitors, their competitors’ food, the
    competitors to the food of their prey, etc. If all life behaved this
    way, few species would survive the all-out War on Life. 2.  The Law may be stated: “You may compete to the full extent of your
    capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors or destroy
    their food or deny them access to food. In other words, you may
    compete but **you may not wage war**.” Diversity is a core strength
    of the community of life. It’s an essential emergent feature,
    providing resilience as conditions inevitably change. Takers are
    essentially at war with the world and with biodiversity. 3.  If hyenas—just to pick another species—were to eliminate their
    predators, their competition, their competitor’s food, and the
    competition of their prey’s food, the community of life would be
    thrown far out of balance and biodiversity would plummet. When
    Takers do the same (eliminating bears and wolves, erecting fences,
    applying pesticides and herbicides), it’s deemed “holy work.” 4.  Increased food production/availability leads to a population
    explosion, but we tell ourselves that humans are exempt from such
    math, despite a towering mountain of evidence to the contrary. 5.  Agriculture and settlement are not necessarily in *violation* of the
    law of life (limits to competition), but certainly are *subject* to
    it, ultimately. 6.  Food begets babies. Famine becomes a chronic condition by always
    increasing the number of mouths to feed. We say we won’t “let”
    people starve, but the word “let” betrays our perceived role as
    gods—deciding who lives or dies. 7.  Tribal maps of the pre-European Americas show a patchwork of
    different cultures. It’s both evidence and a *mechanism* for self
    limiting, because it wasn’t an *option* to expand beyond the land to
    which you belonged. It was also not possible for a Hopi to become a
    Navajo the way it is for a New Yorker to become a Texan. 8.  Just as for a contraption not built with respect to aerodynamic
    laws, a way of life not built to obey the Law of Life will fail to
    remain “in flight.” Modernity—being such a violating construct; an
    enactment of the Taker premise—will die. Whether or not we accept
    this fact is irrelevant: it is guaranteed. Similarly, a person
    stepping off a cliff need not *accept* the role of gravity to
    experience its indifferent, fatal pull. 9.  The world was not made for any one species. Life was fine before
    Taker culture emerged. It wasn’t a world of chaos desperate to be
    tamed by humans. 10. “The people of your culture cling with fanatical tenacity to the
    specialness of man. They want desperately to perceive a vast gulf
    between man and the rest of creation. This mythology of human
    superiority justifies their doing whatever they please with the
    world…” [Human
    supremacy](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-12-human-supremacy/),
    baby. Ishmael addresses misconceptions of the Noble Savage. Leaver
    culture tends to work well for people, lacking common afflictions of
    modernity such as crime, mental illness, drug addiction, etc.

# [NINE (149/159)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-9/)

This marathon chapter presents an intriguing take on the biblical story in Genesis: the story of Adam and Eve, and their sons Cain and Abel. After the seventeen sections is an addendum Quinn suggested in the Foreword of the 25th anniversary edition. \[It’s one of two places where a sub-chapter got more than one line in my notes.\]

1.  Takers branched off from the (continuing) Leaver story at the
    Agricultural Revolution. When did the revolution end? It never did;
    only spreading. It’s a defining feature of our culture. We perceive
    ourselves as revolutionaries against the natural order. 2.  Takers unwittingly adopted a Leaver story about Taker origins, in
    which Takers were the bad guys—cursed by the gods. 3.  Takers imagine they possess special knowledge to rule the world—a
    knowledge wholly absent in dumb Leavers (who, Takers would say, live
    like animals). 4.  Ishmael tells a story of gods debating the thorny question of who
    should be favored in a fox/quail encounter. What is good for one is
    evil for the other—true of virtually every decision the gods make.
    In this story, a magical tree has fruit that bestows upon the gods
    the wisdom of who shall live and who shall die. Possessing this
    wisdom, gods can see that a creature’s luck may be good one day and
    bad the next: parceled fairly. 5.  Fascinating! \[Really, this is a tiny section.\] 6.  The gods discuss this curious creature named Adam. What if
    he—wrongly—*gets it in his head* that this fruit would also make
    *him* as wise as the gods, possessing the Knowledge of Good and
    Evil? He might develop a maniacal hubris, and begin to see all
    limits on man as evil, deciding who lives and dies as if a god, and
    always ruling in his own favor. Some don’t believe this kindly
    creature would become so monstrous, but—erring on the side of
    safety—sternly forbid his eating of the fruit upon punishment of
    death \[an empty threat, in the end\]. 7.  This story is eternally confusing to Takers. After all, isn’t
    knowledge highly prized in our culture, and absolutely necessary if
    we are to successfully fulfill our destiny to rule the world that
    belongs to us? \[In fact, lacking Knowledge of Good and Evil
    constitutes “insanity” in courts.\] Why would the story portray such
    knowledge as being dangerous? Well, perhaps it’s an early
    recognition that by thinking ourselves as wise as the gods, we might
    fast-track a sixth mass extinction in a few short millennia. Nothing
    like this happened before Takers became self-styled gods. 8.  If Takers had written the origin story, it would not describe eating
    from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil as *The Fall*. The event
    would have been praised as a crowning moment marking the beginning
    of a great *Ascent*. Unlike Leavers, Takers became righteous
    proselytizers, insisting everyone should live the way they do: the
    *right* way. Various Leaver cultures that tinkered with agriculture
    walked away from it, but doing so would be dreadfully difficult for
    Takers because it would amount to admission of colossal defeat. 9.  Ishmael shares a map of Eurasia soon after agriculture took hold
    around the Fertile Crescent. The main lesson is that the
    pre-agricultural world beyond this region was not devoid of humans.
    Of particular interest, Semite pastoralists had front-row seats to
    the expansion of these new Takers. Now read the story of Cain and
    Abel in this context. 10. The story of Cain and Abel screams out as a story told by
    pastoralists (Abel; Semites) about an evil agricultural people
    (Cain; Takers)—cursed by the gods (or god)—hell-bent on domination.
    This interpretation clarifies the “Fall” story as a piece of “war
    propaganda” told by the Semites. Alan speculates some about the
    original Takers being identified as Caucasians, now synonymous with
    “whiteness,” but Ishmael shows little interest and does not run with
    this. 11. The Genesis stories survived because Semites were long holdouts, so
    the tales had time to take root. By the time the Hebrews descended
    from Semites, they had become Takers, and kept the inherited story
    without necessarily understanding its anti-Taker origin and message. 12. To Leavers, Takers act as if gods: doling out life and death as they
    see fit. In their telling, this angered their *actual* god, who
    banished them from their original paradise, casting them out to
    break the land by the sweat of their brows. 13. The Leavers saw toilsome agriculture as a curse, and sought some
    rationale: what terrible deed could have resulted in such
    punishment—to be deprived of Earth’s bounty that we enjoy without
    the intense labor? 14. In Hebrew, the name Adam means “man,” and might be associated with
    the human race. Cain and Abel represent the Taker/Leaver split. 15. Likewise, the name Eve means “life.” The expansion-oriented Takers
    needed babies, and women were the key to bringing more life into the
    world (yes; it takes both, but a clan of 80 women and 20 men can
    grow much faster than one with 20 women and 80 men). The fact that
    Eve was cast as the temptress relates to greater life-potential
    enabling more land to be subdued. 16. Granted, agriculture developed independently in other parts of the
    world, but the Semites were cut off by geography so at the time of
    the story’s emergence, they only knew of themselves and these
    hostile expansionists to their north. 17. The original meaning of the story is usually lost on Takers. Their
    clumsy attempt to explain it usually ascribes to the forbidden fruit
    the role of a somewhat arbitrary test of obedience—dismissing the
    (empty) perils of believing themselves to be as wise as gods. The
    part about acquiring wisdom is not an emphasized feature of the
    story. Also, note that Takers easily identify Adam as one of their
    own: not innocent/ignorant like those Leavers, but as a flawed
    agriculturalist like themselves.

### [New Proposed Addition](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-bonus-material/)

In the 25th Anniversary printing of Ishmael, Daniel Quinn responds in the Foreword to the question: “What would you do differently if you were writing *Ishmael* today?” He offers a new dialog between Alan and Ishmael that he suggests would go at the end of Chapter 9. Here is a recap of this addition.

A graph of human population shows a spectacular explosion that we hardly think remarkable. If a graph of the global population of badgers showed a similar trend, you’d find it alarming. The result of this explosion is the initiation of a sixth mass extinction \[the original version of the book predates a growing awareness of the phenomenon bearing this name\]. All this from a toxic habit of thought! Quinn takes another pass at the “food equals births” formulation, and mentions Malthus as an early influential thinker along these lines. The inevitable [downslope of population](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/06/peak-population-projections/) will be tough, and it isn’t clear if we’ll handle it gracefully or disgracefully. It’s a chance to earn the moniker Homo sapiens: will we be wise about it? Clearly, many in our culture will have a tendency to portray any program of decline/retreat in hyperbolic terms laced with every sort of atrocity.

The book becomes more of a novel for a bit, before lessons resume in a new setting.

1.  Alan’s life suffers a number of unexpected, annoying, and painful
    interruptions. By the time he returns to Room 105 to resume lessons
    with Ishmael, the place is cleared out. The janitor indicates the
    previous tenant has been evicted, but is generally unhelpful. 2.  The receptionist for the building management is an accomplished
    stonewaller, and masterfully fails to help Alan track down the
    former tenant. She is indignant at the absurd suggestion that a
    gorilla occupied the room. 3.  Alan tracks down the Sokolow home to learn more about Ishmael’s
    disappearance. The butler, Partridge is top-shelf cagey, but does
    reveal that Rachel—Ishmael’s protector—died a few months back.
    Otherwise, he offers Alan no help. 4.  Alan places an ad in the paper trying to make contact with other
    friends of Ishmael, which bears no fruit. He finally tracked down a
    traveling carnival, finding within one of its cages a very grumpy
    Ishmael, who told him to go away—after refusing Alan’s patronizing
    offer to rescue him. 5.  Alan returns later that night, and Ishmael resigns himself to
    continuing Alan’s lessons—first establishing where they left off. 6.  They work to define culture as the accumulation of information,
    techniques, beliefs, stories, assumptions, theories, customs,
    legends, etc. passed down to younger generations (which happens
    among many species). Human culture was present from Homo habilis all
    the way up through our species as an uninterrupted, evolving,
    successful set of accumulated learning. Leavers treasure this
    heritage and deliberately strive to maintain ancient wisdom. Takers
    flee the past, considering old tales to be obsolete dreck. 7.  Takers preserve techniques for the production of *things*. Leavers
    preserve customs that *work well for their people*. The focus of
    Takers is on what’s good for things vs. people. 8.  Leaver ways have been tested and refined over deep time. Leavers
    don’t need prophets to reveal the one right way to live. In fact,
    there is no *one right way*: Leaver cultures are tailored for
    specific localities: proven to work in that place. Every time Takers
    stamp out a Leaver people, they extinguish an ancient flame of
    immense value. It’s ugly. 9.  Ishmael to Alan: I’m cold and tired: off with you!

# [ELEVEN (209/225)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-11/)

Alan continues to annoy Ishmael with his neediness, pressing Ishmael for the story that Leavers live by. But at least he brings a few blankets. The fourth section/bullet is so loaded with great material that I allowed *four* lines instead of one in my “one-line” notes.

1.  A grouchy Ishmael can find no compelling incentive to teach Alan the
    Leaver story, and Alan keeps offering insufficient motivation. It’s
    on the edge of being finished until Alan says that Takers can’t
    abandon their story without having another story to be in. 2.  Ishmael asks: How did humans become human? What story were they
    enacting? 3.  They establish the Taker bias: pre-agricultural life was devoid of
    meaning—it was stupid, ugly, detestable, and miserable. Ishmael
    raises the question: what was the agricultural revolution a
    revolution *against*? 4.  Alan suggests that we needed to “get somewhere,” to have comforts
    and conveniences, and that even the destitute believe the
    post-revolution world is a big improvement over a “miserable”
    existence that “leads nowhere”—as Takers assert was practiced by the
    Leavers. This is where Alan shares a vivid and powerful impression
    \[also described
    [here](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2023/08/desperate-odds/)\] of a
    pre-revolution man in twilight living on a knife edge of survival,
    locked in a struggle between hunger (chasing elusive prey) and
    ravenous teeth (pursued by predators). Ishmael calls this utter
    nonsense! Like all animals evolved into this world, humans were
    well-adapted to life—generally having loads of leisure time. At this
    point, Ishmael role-plays a hunter-gatherer Leaver, challenged by
    Alan (as a Taker), whom Ishmael calls Bwana (boss). \[It’s truly
    brilliant: probably my favorite part of the book—contrasting the
    easy, flowing attitude of the hunter-gatherer/Leaver against the
    anxious, high-strung Alan/Taker.\] The net effect is to disabuse
    Alan of the sense that life is miserable without planting and
    controlling food. The final point from the Taker perspective is that
    the gods only provide the bare minimum of what one *needs*. Wresting
    control from the gods allows us to get *more* than we need. And
    having accomplished this, the gods lose power over us. We can thumb
    our noses at them. 5.  Ishmael asks: Okay, if you’re now living in *your* hands now rather
    than the hands of the gods, what’s the problem? Why aren’t things
    just great—as they are meant to be? Alan admits that we’re not quite
    there yet. Complete freedom from the power of the gods awaits, once
    we control *everything*. 6.  Takers imagine that living in the hands of the gods is “a state of
    utter and unending anxiety over what tomorrow’s going to bring.” The
    revolution is meant to put us beyond the hands of the gods. The
    Takers are therefore “those who \[believe they\] know good and
    evil,” while Leavers are “those who live in the hands of the gods.”

# [TWELVE (231/249)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/05/ishmael-chapter-12/)

We’ve come a long way, and have just a bit more to lock in.

1.  Alan haggles with Art Owens, the carnival owner, about buying
    Ishmael. A canny-seeming Art shows no genuine interest and seems to
    haggle as a pro-forma gesture. 2.  Alan rouses Ishmael, receiving in return a look of loathing. But,
    Ishmael overcomes his foul mood and sees the sense in carrying on,
    asking “where did we leave off?” 3.  Ishmael gets Alan to connect that humans became human by
    *evolving*—by living in the hands of the gods. Takers, whose story
    is that humans are the end of the evolutionary line have structured
    things so that it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy—by living in
    such a way as to bring an end to creation! 4.  Alan is finally in a place to work out the premise to the Leaver
    story. It’s startlingly simple, making Alan laugh: **humans belong
    to the world**, as has every living being since the beginning. Only
    by belonging to the world and living in the hands of the gods did we
    get to be humans. \[This process might even be called
    *[sacred](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/01/a-religion-of-life/)*.\] 5.  The Taker premise leads to disaster and the end of “creation.”
    According to the Leaver premise, “creation goes on forever” 6.  Alan rolls out wishful speculation on a possible human destiny as
    trailblazers of consciousness, showing other species how to do it
    and not make the mistakes we recognized just in time to correct.
    People need something inspiring to aim for, rather than a list of
    things that make them bad. 7.  Can civilization belong to the world, or is the hunter-gatherer
    lifestyle the only way? Ishmael suggests that civilization *per se*
    is not fundamentally incompatible, but that it is *subject to* the
    Law of Life, and will ultimately fail if out of reckoning. Mindset
    is important. 8.  Rapid transformation of the Soviet bloc (unthinkable even five years
    prior) indicates that major, quick change is feasible. 9.  We desperately need to stop wiping out Leavers, who more than any
    others can help show us ways to live in accordance with the Law of
    Life. Nothing says we must revert to Stone-Age lifestyles, but
    neither can we continue acting as if we own the world. Ishmael
    suggests that a species priding itself on being inventors should get
    busy inventing compatible ways to live. 10. Some prisoners live quite comfortably, concentrating power within
    their domain. It’s the same in the prison of modernity. Many prisons
    have an industry to keep inmates occupied. What is modernity’s
    “prison industry?” Consuming the world. 11. Inequality manifests in both prisons and in modernity (mentioning
    Donald Trump, in fact). Recognizing that inequality is unjust, some
    expend great effort trying to redistribute equity (within the
    modernity prison). The real aim should be *destroying* the prison,
    not redistributing wealth and power within this abominable
    institution. 12. Ishmael announces “I’m finished with you” and issues a huge sneeze.
    Alan vows to be back tomorrow, eliciting a dark stare from Ishmael
    and a final grunt.

# [THIRTEEN (255/275)](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/05/ishmael-chapter-13/)

The lessons are over.

1.  Alan sets out to rescue Ishmael, scraping together all his meager
    savings. His car has trouble and goes to the shop. He has no real
    plan of what to do if he succeeds in rescuing Ishmael, or for that
    matter how to get an unwilling gorilla into his car. 2.  The car is hopeless, so Alan rents a van. He finds the carnival lot
    empty, but spots a few of Ishmael’s belongings. He learns from the
    guy doing clean-up that Ishmael died of pneumonia \[as did Daniel
    Quinn, ultimately\], the disposition of the body unknown to him. 3.  Alan returns home, and calls the butler, Partridge, to let him know
    that Ishmael has died. 4.  Alan notices that the poster of Ishmael’s he retrieved has a reverse
    side. On the front it asks: With man gone, will there be hope for
    gorilla? On the reverse: With gorilla gone, will there be hope for
    man?

# Anything Confusing?

I intend this to be a “living” document (at least the Do the Math appearance) that I may modify to improve clarity, accuracy, or completeness. To this end, if you find anything confusing or missing, please use the comment section below to let me know. It may help to include your level of familiarity with the book (never read; read in 1998; read recently; have read multiple times) so that I might best contextualize the comment (*all* levels of familiarity are valuable in different ways). Refer to sections as 5.3, etc.
