This is part of a [series of posts](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/03/ishmael-overview/) representing ideas from the book, *[Ishmael](https://www.ishmael.org/)*, by Daniel Quinn. I view the ideas explored in *Ishmael* to be so important to the world that it seems everyone should have a chance to be exposed. I hope this treatment inspires you to read the original.

Chapter SIX begins Alan’s quest to discover the Law of Life, during which Ishmael frequently employs analogies to more familiar laws of nature like gravity and aerodynamics to help Alan perceive the contours of the law. This chapter is presented in six numbered subsections, beginning on page 93 of the original printing and page 97 of the 25th anniversary printing. The sections below mirror this arrangement in the book. See the [launch post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/03/ishmael-overview/) for notes on conventions I have adopted for this series.

# 1. Laws by Observation

Ishmael announces to Alan that they will be climbing over the artificial wall erected by our culture in order to apprehend this “unobtainable” knowledge of how to live. In a statement that resonates deeply with me as a physicist, he says:

> We don’t need prophets to tell us how to live; we can find out for
> ourselves by consulting **what’s** **actually there**.

\[Likewise, we did not conjure electrons, photons, molecules, stars, planets, amoebas, newts, or humans: these exist without our brains telling them to.\] Our culture, of course, allows and even encourages us to consult the external universe on essentially any matter except how humans ought to live—convinced that such knowledge cannot possibly be found.

A comparison is made to aeronautical pioneers. It was not certain that any knowledge existed that would enable humans to fly. Skeptics were not hard to find. Squabbles erupted over the proper approach (e.g., flapping wings vs. stationary ones). Lacking knowledge of the guiding laws meant only trial and error could resolve the matter \[a form of consulting *what’s actually there*\]. These pioneers not only lacked knowledge of the laws of aerodynamics (governing what happens to *every* airfoil in an air stream): they could not even be certain that there *were* any such laws.

We are in the same boat: unaware of laws that would govern how to live, and actually fairly certain that none exist. While Alan appreciates the difference between fabricated laws that can be changed with a vote and laws of nature that are non-negotiable, he still maintains that no such laws for how humans live can be found.

# 2. When Laws Apply

We learn about gravity by observing its influence on matter. We don’t study bee behavior to learn about gravity, just as we don’t study orbits to learn about bees. If we entertain the idea that we *can* discover the Law of Life, we are not likely to succeed by looking to the heavens, into the nucleus, or at the mechanics of materials. Where, then shall we look?

Alan suggests the field of anthropology. Ishmael makes the distinction that Newton did not look to physics (texts) for insights on gravity, but to the behavior of matter in the universe. That’s where the real story written: not in academic journals. So, where might the Law of Life be written?

Alan’s next guess is that the Law might be expressed in human behavior, earning a sarcastic rebuke that humans are not the *only* living being on the planet. Eventually, it is clear that any such law would be found written in **the community of life**: in *ecology*. This law is faithfully followed by amoebas, mosses, mushrooms, gnats, newts, turtles, chickadees, and lemurs.

If there were such a law, written in the community of life, Alan reflects, it would not apply to humans—on account of humans being vastly superior to the rest of the community.

Ah: that’s important, Ishmael notes. “Can you think of any other laws from which you are exempt because you’re humans?” Gravity, aerodynamics, genetics, thermodynamics, anything?

Well, no, Alan admits. Yet, he doesn’t see how a law binding the behavior of wasps and skunks should be relevant to us. Ishmael asks if the laws of aerodynamics were always relevant to us. Indeed, the governing laws only became relevant when we pursued flight. Then the smack:

> And when you’re on the brink of extinction and want to live for a
> while longer, the laws governing life might conceivably become
> relevant.

# 3. The Elusive Law

Just as gravity keeps the Earth, solar system, and galaxy together/organized, so too does the Law of Life keep the community of life together.

Alan expresses surprise that biologists would not be all over this Law. Ishmael clarifies that they certainly know plenty about many relevant *phenomena* (i.e., behaviors, interactions, and relationships among species), and these phenomena are not particularly surprising to us as observant cohabitants of the planet. But culture prevents many of its members—scientists included—from seeing the connection into a universal *law*. The major barrier to such generalization is the conviction that any such law would not apply to humans, and therefore cannot be a law.

# 4. Human Exemption?

Is the law of gravity about flight? Well, it isn’t necessarily *about* flight, but it is certainly *relevant*. Gravity operates the same way on an airplane or a bird as on a rock. For that matter gravity isn’t picky about whether the object is airborne or firmly planted on the ground.

Similarly, the Law of Life isn’t *about* civilizations, but *applies* to them in the same way it does to a beehive. It applies to *all life* indiscriminately, which is the main reason Taker culture has failed to identify it.

The mythology of Takers has it that humans alone among millions of species are an “end product” of evolution. The world was made for no other species. The gulf of separation between humans and other species is uncrossable: humans are not even of the same realm; ontologically distinct; transcendent; of a different fundamental substance (soul); apart from nature.

# 5. Three Dirty Tricks

The gods have played three dirty tricks on the Takers that are tough pills to swallow.

First, the Copernican Revolution de-centered Earth as the focal-point of the cosmos almost 500 years ago. This was not gracefully or quickly accepted. By now, most of us have acceded to the fact that humans are not at center stage. Yet, that need not mean we’re not central to creation—just that the gods have a sense of humor about it.

Next, Darwinian evolution indicated that we emerged from the ignominious slime rather than being delivered by divine means. Tougher. It would be incorrect to claim that we’ve fully swallowed this pill yet, since a fair fraction of people in the world reject the idea. Note that the theory of evolution is still quite new in the world: occupying less than 2% of even *Taker* history—which itself is fleeting on human or evolutionary timescales.

The final trick—still unknown within Taker culture—is that humans are not exempt from the Law of Life any more than they are from the law of gravity. While it was possible for Takers to begrudgingly swallow the first two, this one is fundamentally incompatible with Taker culture, and thus cannot be accepted without marking the end of Taker culture.

Creatures living in compliance with the Law continue to exist, to the extent that external factors allow. This is good news for humans: live right by the Law and you may live on. The bad news is that failure to do so results in extinction.

Alan still struggles to see how any of this helps him in his quest to discover the Law of Life. Ishmael explains that analogies to more familiar laws—their effects; their universal application; where they are expressed and how they might be found—should help in this unexplored landscape.

# 6. The Taker Thunderbolt

Revisiting gravity and aerodynamics, Ishmael observes that sitting still does not turn off gravity, but results from our having the \[electromagnetic\] support of the ground preventing us from falling to the center of the Earth. Likewise, a person sitting on an airplane is still every bit as gripped by gravity as they would be on the ground \[ignoring a tiny altitude effect\]. The airplane has a freedom to fly—based on support from the air. By comparison, nothing fundamental precludes a civilization from “flying” (sustained existence) even though it is *subject to* the Law of Life the whole time.

Ishmael crafts a story about an early explorer of human flight, who has built a gangly machine with pedals and flapping wings. Launched off the cliff, the experience is exhilarating: our explorer is airborne! He is ignorant of even the *existence* of aerodynamic laws. But no matter what he *thinks in his head* about his airborne status: he isn’t flying.

The cliff is high, so the plummeting pioneer has plenty of time to congratulate himself and feel awesome: so far, so good! He begins to notice abandoned flying contraptions littering the ground far below, which—although puzzling to him—are of no immediate concern: *they* might not be airborne, but *he* is! What more proof could one possibly want? His flight has been a stunning success thus far, and he can see no reason \[in his limited [meat-brain](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/shortcut-brains/)\] why that won’t continue to be the case. The observation that he is losing altitude merely requires more effort on the pedals, which are there for exactly this circumstance.

His rate of fall accelerates to alarming proportions, but his meat-brain reasoning is that the craft has carried him this far without a scratch, so that must be the indefinite way of things. Yet, no matter how hard he pedals—even with the strength of 1,000 men—it’s hopeless. The contraption was not built in accordance with the laws of sustainable aerodynamic flight, and therefore has no other possible fate than a crash.

The parallels are obvious. Ten-thousand years ago, the progenitors of Taker culture launched on an agricultural spree without any reference to or awareness of a Law of Life relevant to civilizational flight. They were not even curious or circumspect about it. Just launch and enjoy the new freedoms of the air! Ishmael calls their contraption the Taker Thunderbolt.

The experience of liberation from the laws that had bound all other life was a total rush. Free at last! Cities, mechanization, fossil fuels, space, and smart phones followed, continuing to thrill the passengers. Inundated by entertaining distractions, few recognized their rapid descent. In large part, this is because a single generation experiences only a small portion of the flight, so that every stage (in terms of speed; slowly increasing howl of air; decreasing distance to the ground) seems normal—or only *slightly* unsettling—in that snapshot. The sight of failed civilizations is *curious*, but chalked up to quirks and particulars that cannot possibly apply to our case: we’re *flying*, remember!

Yet, obviously if the Taker Thunderbolt is not predicated on principles of sustainability, then its fate is sealed. Ignorance does not shield the Takers one iota. Gravity does not seek mutual consent before exerting its pull. [Wile E Coyote](https://tenor.com/search/wile-e-coyote-falling-off-cliff-gifs) wouldn’t *actually* hang in mid-air until his brain acknowledges the lack of terrestrial support.

A few deeply unpopular observers (e.g., Malthus; [Limits to Growth](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/09/discovering-limits-to-growth/)) notice the rapid descent and voice alarm (with timescale estimates) but are “laughed off stage” by the party in the sky. The logic goes little further than: so far, so good. Faith in technology is a universal, omnipotent salve, enabling the escapist fantasy that the flight will continue indefinitely. Meanwhile, resource depletion and extinctions pile up at an accelerating rate. \[In the case of Malthus, an unforeseen and temporary updraft (fossil fuels) delayed the crash, but in so doing extended the flight over another, even *taller* cliff edge—serving to amplify the ultimate peril and destructive potential. Meanwhile, the crowd cheered at their “luck.”\]

Those labeled as pessimists perform a simple projection and warn of the inevitable crash. Those labeled optimists extol the wonders of technology, and fabricate a flimsy imagination of pedaling hard, pulling out of the dive in the nick of time, and straight into space to fulfill our destiny as masters of the universe. \[Which one seems juvenile?\]

![Capture at 3:45 in [New York Times animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2axbxYbWLmk) featuring Greta Thunberg. So perfect!](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greta-banana-1-1024x729.png)

Yet, rather than the Taker Thunderbolt being the vehicle that carries us to the stars, it is the con**trap**tion committing us to a death spiral. No amount of frantic pedaling will alter the fact that it’s been a falling dud from the start (in ecological terms: the only terms that ultimately matter to a biological species).

Alan speculates that the tragedy is likely to repeat: any survivors will attempt Version 2.0 and make the same mistakes. \[I’m not so sure: comprehensive exploitation of one-time resources—having grabbed all the low-hanging fruit—will make a cyclic repeat far less likely: new cliff edges are not perpetually available in the landscape.\] Ishmael only observes that trial and error is a terribly destructive way to build a civilization. A successful attempt had best adhere to the Law of Life.

# Next Time

In the [next installment](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2025/04/ishmael-chapter-7/), covering Chapter 7, Alan continues to struggle in his attempt to deduce the Law of Life.
