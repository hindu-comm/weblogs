Temporary Lull

Initiating this blog, I wanted to get a few posts out quickly so folks could get a feel for the nature of the content. On that score, the previous post on [100-mpg cars](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/100-mpg-on-gasoline/ "100 MPG on Gasoline: Could We Really?") is probably most representative of future content.

I’ve got dozens of ideas for future posts that I am eager to share, but I will pace myself to about one new substantial post per week (would be hard to sustain more, given demands of my job). Since the [Energy Bulletin](http://www.energybulletin.net "Energy Bulletin") is running these posts as a series, I don’t want to get too far ahead of their weekly publication schedule. As such, I will sit on my heels for a bit until we’re synchronized. So thanks for your patience, and keep a lookout for the next post sometime around the first week of August.
