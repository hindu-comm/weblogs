Growth Has an Expiration Date

Just a quickie. A few weeks back, I tried to cram four Do the Math posts into a 20 minute talk, delivered at the Compass Summit. For those of you who would rather watch 23 minutes of video than sit down to read four posts, here is a [link to the video](http://fora.tv/2011/10/26/Growth_Has_an_Expiration_Date "Compass Summit: Growth Has an Expiration Date") of the talk. Perhaps youâ€™ll see why I should stick to writing.
