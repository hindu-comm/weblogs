Survey the People

The futuristic survey (covered in [last post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2012/10/futuristic-physicists/ "Futuristic Physicists?")) has attracted about 1300 respondents, 900 from [DtM](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/ "Do the Math"), 300 from the [Energy Bulletin](http://www.energybulletin.net/ "The Energy Bulletin") (now [Resilience.org](http://www.resilience.org/ "Resilience.org")), and a smattering from other places.

I will ultimately be sharing the results, but the habitual readers of the aforementioned sites are perhaps not representative of the population at large.

Thus I would like your help in pushing this out to a broader population. See if you can get your friends and family members to take the survey, and perhaps even pass the link on to their friends, etc.
I’ve never done this sort of thing before, so do not know what to expect. But let’s give it a try, yeah?

Here’s the link you want to pass on in whatever form (paste into e-mail, Twitter, link on FaceBook, whatever works): [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2ZC6RD9](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2ZC6RD9 "SurveyMonkey futuristic survey")

Thanks for your help—should be very interesting.
