Chris Martenson Podcast

I’ll cheat on my bi-weekly posting plan and slip in this podcast conversation between Chris Martenson and myself, covering many of the topics I have written about in the last year.

If you don’t have 45 minutes, and are a faster reader than I am, a [transcript](http://www.chrismartenson.com/page/transcript-tom-murphy "CM podcast transcript") is also available—mercifully leaving out many utterances of “um” and “you know” (which is all I seem to hear when I listen to a recording of myself). The original source and surrounding intro/write-up can be found on the [Chris Martenson website](http://www.chrismartenson.com/blog/tom-murphy-time-honest-ourselves-energy-risks/75359 "CM podcast page").
