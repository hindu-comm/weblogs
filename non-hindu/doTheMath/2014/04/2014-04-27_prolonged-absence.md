Prolonged Absence

The cessation of regular blog posts has prompted a number of folks to ask if I still live and breathe. Several reasons contribute to the silence. Primarily, most of what I set out to do and say on Do the Math has been covered. How many times can I calculate total [tidal power](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/12/can-tides-turn-the-tide/ "Can Tides Turn the Tide?") available? I’ve expressed views on our precarious trajectory with respect to [finite resources](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/tag/limits/ "DtM posts on resource limits"), touched on the [psychology](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/tag/psychology/ "DtM psychology posts") of major change and sacrifice, and shared personal explorations in reducing energy/resource [footprints at home](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/tag/home-solutions/ "DtM posts on home solutions"). While some of this continues (look for a post on nickel-iron batteries soon), for the most part it’s already all there.

The second factor is that the research, education, and administration components of my life (i.e., my job) are demanding significant attention. This has generally been true all along, but the administrative burden has skyrocketed of late due to my role as vice chair of the physics department at UCSD since July 2013. Perhaps as I climb up the learning curve, I’ll find more “hobby” time in the months ahead.

While I am sharing personal news, two things of note: 1) My efforts to write and speak about energy and resource use to a broad audience has resulted in UCSD awarding me the [Outstanding Faculty Sustainability Award](http://earthweek.ucsd.edu/sustainabilityawards.html "UCSD sustainability award") for 2014. This despite the fact that I [don’t know what sustainability means](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/10/sustainable-means-bunkty-to-me/ "Sustainable Means Bunkty to Me") (suspecting that none of us really do), and that very little of my efforts have been directed at the UCSD campus. All the same, I am as pleased as I am surprised by the recognition. 2) While not related to Do the Math, I encourage you to check out [this stunning photo](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140418.html "APOD picture: eclipse laser ranging") taken by Dan Long capturing our recent laser ranging efforts during the April 15 lunar eclipse. This is a real photo, taken through a C-11 telescope with a focal reducer (700mm, f/2)—the outgoing laser beam has not been artificially superimposed. Normally it is really difficult to get a picture of our faint beam heading toward the Moon, because the Moon is so glaringly bright. The eclipse provided a great photo-op, and also a means to test the hypothesis of dusty reflectors. To me, this shot is just gorgeous. But I have more invested in it than the average Joe: this picture serves as a visual representation of a key focus in my life over the last 14 years—so of course I’m enamored.
