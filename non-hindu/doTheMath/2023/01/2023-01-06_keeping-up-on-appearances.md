Keeping Up On Appearances

Over the last year or so, a number of audio/video productions have accumulated in which I have had an opportunity to express my evolving thoughts. Being challenged in the art of self promotion (Do the Math is the closest I come to social **me**dia), I tend not to link to everything that comes along. Yet, I recognize that some readers may value pointers to these other formats. So this brief post is an aggregation of recent appearances, to put it all in one place, arranged by context. Still feels a little gross.

The first—and most recent—pair of links relates to the latest Do the Math post on [The Simple Story of Civilization](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2022/12/the-simple-story/). This post started as one page on a bedside note pad, scribbled by coincidence the night before a scheduled podcast interview with Hart Hagan. Although I did not connect the two, I did mention the outline to Hart when we began the zoom session, in case he found it interesting. To my surprise, he launched the conversation with a rough run-through of the script. Here is the video chat:

Shortly after this recording, I wrote up and released the post—which inspired Nate Hagens to record a targeted “[Frankly](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/frankly)” that follows the thread of the post:

About a year prior to this, I dropped in on the [Crazy Town](https://www.postcarbon.org/crazytown/) podcast trio on a road trip, and recorded [this episode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/244372/9074968) with them (also can try [this link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bonus-galactic-scale-energy-with-tom-murphy/id1454850590?i=1000533073049)). It was a fun discussion about physical limits and what features future success must have (I did link this [previously](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2021/08/crazy-town-podcast/) on Do the Math). **Update 2023.02.21**: In the initial posting, I forgot to include [this podcast episode (51)](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/1403161/9157157) from Breaking Down: Collapse from September of 2021.

Early in 2022, Nate Hagens included me on his new podcast called [The Great Simplification](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episodes), as [episode 18](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/18-tom-murphy). I am pleased to be in such good company: the other guests on the podcast have been insightful and thought-provoking. In episode 18, Nate and I explore physical limits to growth—echoing some of the foundational posts of the Do the Math blog.

**Update 2023.02.21**: Hart Hagan recently did a second podcast interview with me:

The next video is a relatively high production-value interview by the UC San Diego Division of Physical Sciences about my free [textbook](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m). (I put this up [before](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2021/05/put-on-a-video/), but also include here for completeness.)

This next pair relates to my involvement in the formation of the Planetary Limits Academic Network ([PLAN](https://planetarylimits.net); see [post about it here](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2021/11/finally-a-plan/)). First I’ll point to a [radio interview](https://kkfi.org/program-episodes/resource-usage-today-impacts-our-future-quality-of-life/) of myself and PLAN co-founder Melody LeHew, in which we discuss the predicament, and what PLAN might do in this context. Next is a video interview for Scientists’ Warning along with PLAN instigator Ben McCall, in which we address the challenges associated with radical change in our academic trajectories:

So I think that’s all I want to point out here. Anyway, I hope at least some of these provide value.
