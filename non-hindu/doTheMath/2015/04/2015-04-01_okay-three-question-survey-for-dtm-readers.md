Okay: Three Question Survey for DtM Readers

I should have done it right the first time. I now realize that Iâ€™m hungry for a *tiny* bit more information in relation to personality type. I have had almost 500 responses to the previous query (see [previous post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2015/03/one-question-survey-for-dtm-readers/ "One-question Survey for DtM Readers"), below). The results are fascinating. I have added two quick questions that will give me a fair bit of insight into some key systematic issues.

Even if you have answered the poll already, I would appreciate a quick moment of your time to answer two additional questions ([click here](http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/survey/mb_survey2.html "Myers-Briggs survey, take 2")).
It requires *very little* time: especially if you responded to the first survey request.

If you did not respond to the first survey, please do [this one](http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/survey/mb_survey2.html "Myers-Briggs survey, take 2").

Instructions appear on the survey page for how to determine your Myers-Briggs type, if you do not already know it. Thanks for your patience, and look for a post in mid-April with the jaw-dropping results.
