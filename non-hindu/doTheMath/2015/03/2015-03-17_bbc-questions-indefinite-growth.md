BBC Questions Indefinite Growth

Theo Leggett of the BBC interviewed me in late January as part of a program asking: “[Can the World Get Richer Forever?](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31868506 "Write-up on Can the World Get Richer Forever")”
You can [listen to the show here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02ljc20 "BBC Audio via Flash").
My part begins about eleven minutes in.

I was also asked to contribute some short text for the [write-up](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31868506 "Write-up on Can the World Get Richer Forever") (same as first link above), but apparently Theo was unable to get contributions from all participants, so wrote the piece himself. But here is what I sent him. I was asked to answer the question:

### Can the World Get Richer Forever?

Shame on you for even asking. Of course not. At present population levels, we are putting unprecedented pressure on finite resources. We are conducting a grand-scale, unauthorized experiment on the 4.5 billion-year-old planet. The fact that we have not hit the bounds in a few generations of outrageous growth should not be taken as evidence for our long-haul prospects. We live like kings today, on the backs of roughly 100 energy slaves each (human metabolism is 100 Watts, but Americans enjoy 10,000 W of continuous power). Our richness is very much tied to surplus energy availability, and **that** so far has been a story of finite fossil fuels. But even under solar power, we [can’t continue](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/ "Galactic-Scale Energy") our track record of 3% energy growth per year for even several hundred years! Global physical limits—thermodynamic, energy return on energy invested, finite arable land, water, fisheries, climate change, etc.—are all asserting themselves to remind us that *nature doesn’t care about our dreams*. The other point to make is that even if we capped physical growth due to finite resources, we [cannot expect to continue getting richer indefinitely](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/can-economic-growth-last/ "Can Economic Growth Last?").
This would necessarily take the form of non-physical exchanges of utility/worth, but to keep growing these activities would have to eventually utterly dominate the economy—rendering the finite and essential resources [effectively free](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2012/04/economist-meets-physicist/ "Exponential Economist Meets Finite Physicist").
And tell me how **that** makes sense.
