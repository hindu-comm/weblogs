One-question Survey for DtM Readers

I have a new post written up, but thought that before I release it I should get some delicious new data.

To that end, please take this single-question bare-bones survey (link decommissioned; see [this post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2015/04/okay-three-question-survey-for-dtm-readers/ "Okay: Three Question Survey for DtM Readers")) about your personality type. There are sixteen choices in a drop-down menu according to the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator. If you do not already know your type, you can find free online versions. While I have no particular affinity for this specific one, it may be good for the sake of uniformity that you go take [this one](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp "Free Myers-Briggs test").
It’s 72 yes/no questions (should take 5–10 minutes).

Just remember to be honest and answer for the person you *are*, rather than the person you may aspire to be (if different).

And don’t forget in your excitement to indicate the outcome on my lighting-fast survey (link decommissioned; new survey [here](http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/survey/mb_survey2.html "Myers-Briggs survey, take 2")).

I’ll let you know what it’s all about shortly.
