Peak Power Video

I’m on a video kick lately, finding that it’s a good way to capture key points and reach people who never would have stumbled onto Do the Math. Here is a video to accompany the [latest post on peak power](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/06/brace-for-peak-impact/).

I also added a playlist to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRX9ZS1z6ZUtr3ryq03WtHA) that has other appearances I’ve done (podcasts and the like). While I was at it (as I learn this space), I added chapters to my channel videos to make it easier to find key content. Enjoy! I think I’m also supposed to say: please like and subscribe—but I don’t know if I’m doing this right, yet.
