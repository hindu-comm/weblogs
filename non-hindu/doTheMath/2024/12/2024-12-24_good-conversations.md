Good Conversations

It’s Tuesday morning and I didn’t prepare a new post, having been busy helping birds and bats. Maybe, though, the holidays have given you more free time than usual, so that you can afford to take in a podcast episode or two. If so, this post introduces two conversations I’ve had that do a decent job of capturing my recent perspectives. Below, I provide links and overviews of the content of each, in the form of the questions I was asked. Do you already know how I’ll answer each one?

# Human Nature Odyssey: Astrophysics for a New Stone Age

About a year ago, I [recommended](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/01/recommended-podcasts/) a fantastic podcast called [Human Nature Odyssey](https://sites.libsyn.com/505433), by Alex Leff. If you haven’t listened to it, the previous link allows you to get up to speed on past episodes. Alex reluctantly read an assigned book at age 14 that changed his life, as the book has a tendency to do. That book is *[Ishmael](https://www.ishmael.org/books/)*, by Daniel Quinn, which I have touted in a number of posts. It was a key part of the [Reading Journey](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2023/07/a-reading-journey/) I laid out a while back, further expounded in a [dedicated post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2023/08/call-me-ishmael/), and formed a large part of the inspiration behind my proposed [Religion of Life](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/01/a-religion-of-life/).

Alex and I have had a few exchanges over the last year, and he honored me with [a spot](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/astrophysics-for-a-new-stone-age-with-tom-murphy/id1682310706?i=1000680945770) in his season 2 lineup of Human Nature Odyssey, titled [Astrophysics for a New Stone Age](https://sites.libsyn.com/505433/astrophysics-for-a-new-stone-age-with-tom-murphy). Alex edited the conversation into a tight dialog, adding his customary soundscapes to create a podcast having a higher-than-normal production quality. Paraphrasing Alex’s questions, here is how the flow went:

-   What initially drew you to astrophysics?
-   Why do you call yourself a “recovering” astrophysicist?
-   How do you view science, now from the outside?
-   What inspired you to start Do the Math?
-   Wait: we’re not going to colonize space?
-   How can you say that your “space laser” is **far** less impressive
    than a simple amoeba?
-   How were you influenced by Daniel Quinn’s writings?
-   Could you describe your cancer diagnosis for modernity?
-   Why use the vague term “modernity?”
-   The modernity cancer has *perks*: can’t we keep those?
-   Are you suggesting that we go back to the Stone Age?
-   Do you still lament losing astrophysics if modernity collapses?
-   Are you using a map and compass on your journey?
-   What aspects of science are valuable in a post-modernity world?

I like the conversation that emerged, and hope you do as well. It should be available through most podcast apps, including this [Apple link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/astrophysics-for-a-new-stone-age-with-tom-murphy/id1682310706?i=1000680945770), and also [via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtnR1kPz9cs) (audio only).

# Marriage Proposal (Teaser)

<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>

The second conversation was with Josh Kearns on [Doomer Optimism](https://www.youtube.com/@doomeroptimism/videos) ([episode 246](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MqBFR8HIE)). And, yes, a marriage proposal pops up. This is a longer conversation than the previous one, happening to cover some similar ground (astrophysics, lunar ranging). But it also delves into religion, which I’m not sure I’ve discussed in other podcasts. It then touches on the fertility decline story and demographic modeling. Near the end, I think Josh implies that I’m fat, or will soon become so. Here is a paraphrased list of questions Josh put to me:

-   What does it mean to be a recovering astrophysicist?
-   How could you do lunar ranging if the landings were *faked*?
-   What’s at stake in the potential collapse of modernity?
-   What’s it like to shed the mythology of progress, and does that make
    you an outsider now?
-   You define modernity as starting with agriculture: is that going too
    far?
-   Could you summarize the [Metastatic
    Modernity](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/metastatic-modernity-video-series/)
    arc and messages?
-   What’s your plan? Can this be a curriculum? Who’s your audience?
    Youth salvation?
-   Are we preparing today’s students for yesterday’s world?
-   What are your triage priorities: institutional or individual?
-   Can you explain what [human
    supremacy](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/08/mm-12-human-supremacy/)
    is and why you focus on it?
-   What is your religious background and journey?
-   You seem to have arrived at a new religion of sorts: can you
    describe this?
-   Are there inroads to transform religions by carrying forward their
    best parts?
-   Big shift: why is fertility rate falling rapidly and globally?
-   How many completely wrong predictions can experts make before they
    give up?
-   How can global energy use peak before global population peaks?
-   What is the economic impact of declining energy use?
-   If facing near-term demand-driven decline, should we start prepping
    now?
-   Is there anything people fret over that they really don’t need to
    worry about?

As it happens, I speak slowly enough that playback at 1.5x speed is well-tolerated.

# Two Others Coming Soon

Two other recent interviews are in production, and I might decide to append them here if they’re out soon. I’ll send an e-mail note to subscribers if/when that happens. If you have not yet subscribed, you can do so on the right-hand panel (or at bottom on some interfaces). I don’t share your e-mail address with anyone, and send an alert every time I put new content on the site (may need to check spam or “promotions” and instruct your client to accept them).
