MM #6: Accidental Tourists

This is the sixth of 18 installments in the [Metastatic Modernity video series](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/metastatic-modernity-video-series/) (see [launch announcement](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/metastatic-modernity-launch/)), putting the meta-crisis in perspective as a cancerous disease afflicting humanity and the greater community of life on Earth. This episode makes the point that humans were not inevitable as a culmination of evolution. We are not the purpose or goal of the Earth or universe.

As is the custom for the series, I provide a stand-alone companion piece in written form (not a transcript) so that the key ideas may be absorbed by a different channel. The write-up that follows is arranged according to “chapters” in the video, navigable via links in the YouTube description field.

# Introduction

This is the usual short naming of the series, of myself, and the topic of this episode (we didn’t *have* to be here) as part of the process for putting modernity into context.

# Here by Accident

None of this was planned. This universe we find ourselves in…this planet and the life upon it…this situation we find ourselves in…wasn’t planned. It happened **because it could**.

Think about rolling a six-sided dice 20 times and recording the sequence of numbers. After-the fact, it is clear that the result had a chance of materializing, even if its particular odds happened to be less than one in a quadrillion. *Something* had to happen.

Not everything that *can* happen *will* happen. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won’t. The path is a very unpredictable, twisted, braided, meandering set of interacting paths unfolding in parallel. It’s not a linear timeline of the sort we like to imagine. It’s many stories at once that interconnect and influence each other. We can’t draw such a thing in a textbook, so tend to simplify to a cleaner linear narrative.

Now, I personally don’t have cause or standing (authority) to [deny determinism](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/05/whats-the-point/) (spiced by quantum behaviors, of course), but even a fully deterministic system can be hopelessly **unpredictable** ([see simple example](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/03/the-game-of-life/)). Therefore, we can’t possibly predict how the future will unfold in any detail. We can’t know where things are going, in detail.

Because of the unpredictability involved, we didn’t *have* to be here as a species—or as individuals, of course. You’ve likely heard stories about circumstances that easily would have prevented your mother from meeting your father. As one easy-to-conceive example at the species scale, the Chicxulub asteroid impact 66 million years ago killed off the dinosaurs and opened the door for mammals to become Earth’s megafauna. If that effectively random (unpredictable) event had not happened, it is hard to imagine that humans would have been around by now.

# Tree of Life

One way to see the degree of convolution is in depictions of trees of life, as in the example below.

![From Spang & Ettema (2016) in [Nature Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201656).](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tree-life-2-1024x679.png)

Eukaryotes (which includes plants and animals) are on the right-hand side. Every species alive today is one of many temporary twig-ends in this ever-growing tree of life. We are all here now, but in no way constitute a permanent set. Humans are one of about 10 million species (twig ends), and are not guaranteed to even have a successor species descended from us. That outcome does not always emerge.

The tree of life shows our *ancestral* connectedness, and the support provided by the trunk and branches (our entire heritage). But it *does not* depict the countless interactions and complex inter-dependencies between all the species, which would render the diagram an impenetrable mess—one we would not even know how to draw in its full complexity.

# Lots of Dead Ends

I like this depiction from [Evogeneao](https://www.evogeneao.com/en/learn/tree-of-life).

![From [Evogeneao](https://www.evogeneao.com/en/learn/tree-of-life).](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tree-of-life_2000-1024x483.png)

While it is not representative in terms of species numbers (over-emphasizes eukaryotes), it does depict the time-evolution a bit better (albeit non-linearly) as a set of concentric ellipses. We see the Cambrian Explosion of biodiversity among eukaryotes, followed by five mass extinctions. Looking closely, one can see many terminating twigs along the way, often ending at a mass extinction event (but not always so). Our dense shrub indeed looks more like this, having lots of terminal twigs deep within it.

The diagram puts us, artificially, at the far lower right at one extreme. This arbitrary and misleading choice implies some sort of privileged status as an extreme or superlative species. It’s better to consider all current twig ends as on more equal footing in terms of evolutionary heritage.

# Evolution has Terrible Aim!

The main point I want to make from these diagrams is that we (humans) were not the purpose. Evolution was not aiming to make us. And if it *was*, for some reason, **it sure had terrible aim**! I mean, it made ten million other species at the same time! There was nothing purposeful about the trajectory that led to humans. The path to humans just *could* happen, and was simply one of ten million simultaneous, intertwined trajectories all manifesting at once.

We’re not the best species on the planet. We’re not the pinnacle. We’re not what Earth has been waiting for.

To be sure, humans have a number of incredible traits (though no monopoly!). But we also happen to be the species causing the most harm to other species, and appear to be initiating a sixth mass extinction. So, we need to be careful about labeling ourselves as “the best” in some way. The least controversial superlative is our brain-power, but it’s a superficial, flashy sort of power that might prove to be maladaptive, in ecological terms (the only ones that matter in the long term).

# The Club of Life

I like to think in terms of the existence of a Club of Life. We’re relatively new members—only recently inducted into the club. Now, 99% of our dues have been paid by our ancestor species—a hefty portion from the microbes, in fact. That’s our biological heritage, as covered in [Episodes 3](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/mm-3-early-life/) and [5](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/mm-5-our-biological-inheritance/). We only got here on the backs of all that tireless innovation and problem solving.

Our membership may be revoked at any time. No guarantees. Failure to work within the ecological context ([Episode 4](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/07/mm-4-evolution/)) is the most common transgression, and is not tolerated by the merciless arbiter of evolution.

We’re on notice, as we’re going around unilaterally terminating the memberships of many innocent species who did not themselves violate ecological norms, but proved to be incompatible with modernity. They did nothing wrong, but [didn’t stand a chance](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/03/they-didnt-stand-a-chance/). Modernity is to blame: that’s where the [true incompatibility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621003327) lies.

Like it or not, humans are not a keystone species upon which countless other members of ecological communities depend for their survival. We are not necessary for the whole thing to work—which it managed to do quite well for hundreds of millions of years (billions, really) without a human presence that only materialized over the last 3 million years. Earth was not suffering for all those eons before humans came along and eventually (just 10,000 years ago, wrongly) assumed ownership.

We are latecomers who are really just **lucky** to be in the club. My instinct is to respect the rules of this venerable club—rules that have allowed the club to work for so long, and which indeed allowed us to come into existence. We should try to find ways to become good citizens—indispensable members. Until now, all species basically played by the same rules in a co-evolving arrangement that tracked each others’ developments.

# Unsustainable Trajectory

This next bit may seem like an unsubstantiated leap. It makes total sense to me, and if it doesn’t to you at present, then I hope it will by the end of this series when all the various perspectives have been covered. For now, you can simply view this as exemplifying the perils of not playing by the club’s rules (which include the analog of gravity).

![Image from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/mountain-biking-sports-leaping-95032/).](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bike-jump-1024x531.jpg)

We in modern society imagine ourselves as having transcended the mundane constraints of life on Earth. We have launched ourselves onto this new and exciting trajectory. However, the contraption we have launched for this fun and exhilarating thrill-ride is not built on principles of sustainable flight (principles of ecological sustainability). It will not somehow magically be able to hold a steady altitude, let alone keep climbing. For all our smarts, no one has even sketched out a credible plan for how modernity could continue indefinitely given its utter dependence on non-renewable material resources.

Granted, our current state of being momentarily airborne feels indistinguishable from flying—temporarily. It is indeed exhilarating.

**But**…this mode is not vetted on ecological or evolutionary grounds as being *sustainable*. It hasn’t demonstrated that it can play by the club’s rules and thus stay within the club. In fact, nothing indicates that it *possibly would be* ecologically sustainable, as we witness our initiation of what sure looks like a sixth mass extinction, which is extremely troubling. Mountains of evidence point to a **grossly unsustainable** mode of life, on almost every front.

Thus, I want to be very careful about our tendency toward hubris. Yes, we’re in mid-air right now and it’s really amazing and we can point to a lot of associated perks (for humans alone, in the short term, importantly). But, if it’s unsustainable then it is by definition going to fail. What evidence might possibly bolster the case that our current path is at all ecologically sustainable?

# Closing & Do the Math

The next installment will chronicle the ecological nosedive resulting from our madcap trajectory as the consequence for violating Club rules.

As always, I encourage viewers to find the more polished, thoughtful, complete written version—which you have clearly already done!
