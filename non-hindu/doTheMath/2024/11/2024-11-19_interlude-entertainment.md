Interlude Entertainment

My apologies for abandoning a regular posting cadence. I helped my mother move across the country and have been distracted by a number of other worthy activities, like building all manner of nest boxes from on-site materials. Several ideas for posts are brewing, so I am unlikely to remain silent for much longer.

In the meantime, some may be interested in checking out a few of my latest media appearances. The most recent is an interview by Derrick Jensen for [Resistance Radio](https://resistanceradioprn.podbean.com/).

The second plug is an appearance on Nate Hagens’ [The Great Simplification](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episodes), in a [joint discussion](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/reality-roundtable-11) with DJ White—whose heterodox insights I have long appreciated.

I am doing another podcast interview later today, and will post it here (rather than making a new dedicated post) when it’s out. \[Update: ended up making a [dedicated post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2024/12/good-conversations/) after all.\] I’ll test the new subscribe feature to alert folks when it’s available. So, consider subscribing to get e-mail alerts about new Do the Math content (information absolutely not shared):

<div class="tnp tnp-subscription">

<div class="tnp-field tnp-field-firstname">

First name

</div>

<div class="tnp-field tnp-field-surname">

Last name

</div>

<div class="tnp-field tnp-field-email">

Email

</div>

<div class="tnp-field tnp-field-button" style="text-align: left">

</div>

</div>

I would appreciate some feedback as to whether e-mails from the subscription service are working from this site (i.e., not blocked). Please use the comments to let me know if you did or did not receive an e-mail (by mid-day Tuesday). I will delete these housekeeping comments, once they serve their purpose. Thanks!
