Let's Put on a Video, Shall We?

Most of us have seen it happen. An exhausted school teacher, sometimes suffering from what we recognize in hindsight as a hangover, announces to the class that instead of the usual lesson plan, we’re all going to watch a video.

That’s what I’m doing today, in effect. Last week’s [post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2021/05/why-worry-about-collapse/) about factors facilitating collapse was of beastly proportions. This week, I’m taking a breather and pointing you to a five-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fbOWhJy7So) and a [write-up of an interview](https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/a-textbook-case-for-heeding-planetary-limits) relating to my recent [book](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m).

The pieces were put together by the UC San Diego [Division of Physical Sciences](https://physicalsciences.ucsd.edu/) (Mario Aguilera and Sherry Seethaler coordinating the interview and Debbie Meyer constructing a quality video). I’m sporting the outgrown late-COVID haircut that lopped off my ponytail of 28 years (performed by my terrified wife). It also appears that I failed to prioritize shaving for the interview day, which was scheduled weeks in advance, so did not exactly catch me by surprise. Oh well. Appearances only count for so much.

And since this video is short, I would hate for you to feel ripped off. I might, therefore, recommend another [recent video by Nate Hagens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYeZwUVx5MY) that has a slightly longer run time (approaching three hours; I suggest taking it in doses). In an approach somewhat similar to the [collapse post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2021/05/why-worry-about-collapse/), Nate has put together a long list of factors, cast as societal myths, that contribute to our collective miscalibration about how we might expect the future to go. Many of the themes will be familiar to and resonant with Do the Math readers, but from a usefully alternate angle.
