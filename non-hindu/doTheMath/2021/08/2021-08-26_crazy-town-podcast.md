Crazy Town Podcast

![Crazy Town Podcast Logo](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/crazy-town-logo.jpg)

If you’ve enjoyed *Do the Math* even just a little bit over the years, you have Asher Miller to thank, in part. Asher is the Executive Director of the [Post Carbon Institute](https://www.postcarbon.org/), whose work I had been following for a few years when I reached out in 2011. I reported that I was going to be passing through their neighborhood, and asked if they would be up for a meeting. I spent a few hours with Asher, and he encouraged me to commit some of my ideas and analyses to writing, suggesting a blog format that could be re-posted to the *Energy Bulletin*, which is now [Resilience.org](https://www.resilience.org/).

So I took his advice. Within a month, I created *Do the Math*, and the *Energy Bulletin* promptly picked up my first post on [Galactic Scale Energy](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/galactic-scale-energy/), which then found its way to reddit. Thus, within a few days of publishing my first blog post, I had hit the 100,000 page view mark. That strong start—and even the fact that it started at all—is due in no small measure to Asher’s encouragement, suggestion, and the close connection between PCI and the *Energy Bulletin*.

Fast-forward a decade, and I again was set to pass through PCI’s (relocated) haunt. I again reached out to Asher, who suggested that I stop in for a podcast recording of [Crazy Town](https://www.postcarbon.org/crazytown/), which he does with Jason Bradford (PCI Board President; on his farm) and Rob Dietz (PCI Program Director). We had a fun time together, and an enjoyable conversation, which you can listen to on your podcast app of choice by clicking [this link](https://link.chtbl.com/ListenCrazyTown), or you could try [this semi-permanent link](https://www.buzzsprout.com/244372/9074968) to the “bonus” episode in question.
