Limits to Economic Growth

Readers of Do the Math will be familiar with my line of argument that economic growth as we know it is destined to end. It was the [second post](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/07/can-economic-growth-last/) of the whole series, and the basis for one of the more popular posts recounting a [conversation I had with an economist](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2012/04/economist-meets-physicist/). I also adapted the same reasoning into [Chapter 2 of my recent textbook](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m#chapter.2). Already, I sound like a broken record. Yet I write this update to announce the publication of this idea in a “real” article in *[Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01652-6)*. Unfortunately, *Nature Physics* does not allow open access for Comments, but [this Share link](https://rdcu.be/cR8Pp) should allow you to read the content without a subscription. If the link does not work, here is a [link to the PDF](https://tmurphy.physics.ucsd.edu/papers/limits-econ-final.pdf). Anyway, that’s all. Please share with anyone you think may be interested.
