*Thanks for [subscribing](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?) to
**[Razib Khan’s Unsupervised Learning](https://razib.substack.com/)**.
October and early November brought paid subscribers two major pieces.
Here are a couple of excerpts for free subscribers. Paid subscribers
will find follow-up notes throughout.*

### [The eternal wanderers: Sephardic Jewish genetics and culture](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-eternal-wanderers-sephardic-jewish)

The history and culture of Sephardic Jews, those who were expelled from
Spain in 1492, are more complex than those of Ashkenazi Jews. But the
past decade has seen the mysteries of their genetics and history
unraveled, thread by thread:

> Unlike the history of the Ashkenazim, the story of their Sephardic
> cousins is not a tight narrative. Both groups emerged from a synthesis
> of native Europeans and Levantine migrants, but after their early
> similarities, their paths diverged. After 1000 AD, the Ashkenazim exit
> the world stage before their grand cultural entrance in the 19th
> century. In contrast, the Jews of Iberia operated within a
> multi-religious landscape for centuries, engaging with and defining
> the broader public culture. One of these medieval Sephardic Jews,
> Maimonides, deployed a synthesis of Greek Aristotelianism with the
> ancient tradition of Jewish learning to construct a system of belief
> and practice that now serves as the benchmark of orthodoxy for Jews
> the world over, Ashkenazim and Sephardim both.
>
> The drama of the 1492 expulsion, the persistence of crypto-Jews, and
> the Sephardic adventures across the Mediterranean inspired Benjamin
> Netanyahu’s father, himself Ashkenazi, to devote his academic career

> in Fifteenth-Century
> Spain](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679410651/geneexpressio-20).
> While Ashkenazi Jews grew in number through natural increase, the
> Sephardim assimilated and influenced Jews in every corner of the
> world, leaving their mark on history through the attractiveness of
> their culture to others. Once limited to Spain, today the Sephardic
> tradition in the form of religious ritual and Hebrew pronunciation
> colors the daily life of populations from Morocco to Yemen to Iran,
> and of course Israel itself. The genius of the Sephardim transcends
> their genes and lives on in a patchwork legacy of customs, practices
> and traditions embraced in lands from the Atlantic to the Hindu Kush.

### [Heritability of height: the long and the short of it](https://razib.substack.com/p/heritability-of-height-the-long-and)

Height is a socially and scientifically important trait. Tall men tend
to be type-cast as leaders, and height clearly has benefits on the male
side of the mating market. But for a geneticist, height is important
because it’s a critical test case for how evolution can shape a trait
over time given underlying genetic variation. Though we’ve always known
that you inherit your height from your parents, today we understand it
genomically due to the combination of sequencing and modern
computational biology:

> From the perspective of a geneticist, human height has long been known
> to be one of the most heritable of characteristics. There is clearly
> variation between families and populations, and being tall or short
> runs in particular lineages. Today we are finally arriving at a good

> [genomic
> differences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-018-1902-3)
> which account for this variation. As a trait that is subject to
> natural selection (albeit weak and variable), the average height of
> human populations has shifted upward and downward several times over
> the course of our species’ evolutionary history. There’s also a reason
> that men exaggerate their

I had a couple of main goals with this piece. The first was to trace the
complexity behind a heritable trait with a profile like height. Think
the complete inverse of the type of trait conventionally used to
illustrate simple genetic concepts like recessive and dominant: say eye
color or Gregor Mendel’s pea plant characteristics. There is a gene for
the extreme stature of dwarfism, but otherwise, there’s no one simple
“height gene.” And second was to tell the story of how the conundrum of
height itself, and particularly its smooth (not disjoint) distribution
of values in human populations… drove the genesis of an entire field we
all take for granted today: statistics. We owe so many ubiquitous
statistical methods to the early 20th-century drive to understand height
specifically.

### **Podcasts**

On the *Unsupervised Learning* podcast, my guests and I have drilled
down on a broad variety of topics over the last month:

-   [Kat Rosenfield: how did culture become
    middle-school?](https://razib.substack.com/p/kat-rosenfield-how-did-culture-become)

-   [Joshua Lipson: on Jewish genetic
    genealogy](https://razib.substack.com/p/joshua-lipson-on-jewish-genetic-genealogy)

-   [Alexander Young: everything you want to know about cognitive
    genomics](https://razib.substack.com/p/alexander-young-everything-you-want)

-   [Trent Colbert: standing athwart the
    mob](https://razib.substack.com/p/trent-colbert-standing-athwart-the)

-   [Carole Hooven: let's talk about
    testosterone](https://razib.substack.com/p/carole-hooven-lets-talk-about-testosterone)

-   [Eric Berger: SpaceX and Elon
    Musk](https://razib.substack.com/p/eric-berger-spacex-and-elon-musk)

-   And here are the [currently ungated
    podcasts](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) all in one
    place.

First, [Kat Rosenfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kat_Rosenfield)
and Trent Colbert are very different people. Kat is a millennial woman
who writes
[fiction](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08SMFSLVQ/geneexpressio-20)
and [cultural commentary](https://unherd.com/author/kat-rosenfield/).
Trent is a zoomer man attending Yale Law School. But we live in a common
American culture and are subject to universal tensions, no matter our
gender, age or race. Over the last decade, Kat has gotten caught up in
the culture wars, and become a commentator on them from the perspective
of a liberal who has resisted woke excesses. Trent recently became the
[target](http://persuasion.community/p/why-i-didnt-apologize-for-that-yale)
of a campaign at Yale Law School over an innocent email. Exactly the
type of thing Kat might write about in one of her columns.

My conversations with Kat and Trent are attempts to explore where we
are, and how we got here, as a culture. You may or may not be aligned
with the changes in American politics and society, but they are going to
impact you. Trent’s experience is a cautionary tale that even the most
harmless and casual wording choices can explode into controversy, while
Kat’s trajectory illustrates that an objectively mild rejection of
objectively radical changes to norms and traditions can get you expelled
from the “club.”

I don’t have any plans to turn *Unsupervised Learning* into a “Culture
Wars” podcast, but now and then it’s useful to hear from guests who
confront the constant stream of controversies that now define American
public discourse.

Speaking of which, Josh Lipson and Alex Young touch on some of these
controversies, in particular those relating to ethnicity, race and
religion. Josh comes out of the world of amateur Jewish genetic
genealogy, a description that belies the depth and richness of the
knowledge of enthusiasts within the community. Josh and I talk about all
the details of Jewish genetic history, with a focus on the Ashkenazim,
what the science tells us now, and what it might be able to tell us in
the future. This episode is a perfect complement to my post, [Ashkenazi
Jewish genetics: a match made in the
Mediterranean](https://razib.substack.com/p/ashkenazi-jewish-genetics-a-match).
Josh knows his stuff, so we dive pretty deep.

Meanwhile, if you read my piece [Should we get "woke" on genetics and
behavior?](https://razib.substack.com/p/should-we-get-woke-on-genetics-and)
or Dr. Kathryn Paige Harden’s [The Genetic
Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20),
I can recommend my conversation with Alex Young. He’s a young
statistical geneticist working on traits like educational attainment. If
you are a geneticist outside of this space, I highly recommend listening
to Alex, because we get into the details of why and how he does what he
does. It’s not [junk
science](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/why-dna-is-no-key-to-social-equality-on-kathryn-paige-hardens-the-genetic-lottery/),
it’s serious science, and if you insist on
[dismissing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06784-5) it, at
least do yourself the favor of grappling with the actual ideas coming
straight out of labs like these.

Then, I had Carole Hooven on to talk about sex and testosterone,
evolution and biology, but we ended up spending a lot of time on the
climate of intolerance for dissenting opinions in modern academia.
Highly recommend [T: The Story of Testosterone, the Hormone that
Dominates and Divides
Us](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08HKX6GWH/geneexpressio-20)
itself, but I still maintain that the lengthy digression of the podcast
is well worth a listen. We don’t have time to pretend people like Carole
aren’t actively being purged right now on the flimsiest pretenses. Least
of all those subscribers also still in academia.

Finally, I talked to Eric Berger about this book, [Liftoff: Elon Musk
and the Desperate Early Days that Launched
SpaceX](https://razib.substack.com/p/eric-berger-spacex-and-elon-musk).
In a wide-ranging conversation that begins with the private space
industry and Elon Musk, and touches on mining in the asteroid belt and
O’Neill Cylinder Space Settlements, the closest fly-by we make with
politics consists of discussing NASA’s prospects for the future. Eric’s
passion for space and the technological frontier is infectious, and he
reminds us that humanity can still do great things when we set our minds
to it.

### **Reader comment**

In [The eternal wanderers: Sephardic Jewish genetics and
culture](https://razib.substack.com/p/the-eternal-wanderers-sephardic-jewish)
a reader talks about the beliefs of the early-modern philosopher
Spinoza, and how it related to his Jewish background:

*The language Spinoza uses sounds pantheist because the Jewish community
he was from had a panentheist conception of God. The name Yahweh is the
causative form of the Hebrew verb for “to be”. Therefore, it can be
interpreted as “causes to be”, “that which causes to be”, or causality
itself. Keep that in mind, when you read Spinoza writing “That eternal
and infinite being we call God, or Nature, acts from the same necessity
from which he exists”. In the Kabbalistic conception of God, the Ein Sof
is the one aspect of God that is not in some way synonymous with the
universe. The Ein Sof is the infinite.*

*There are many correspondences between Spinoza thought and the writings
of the kabbalist Abraham Cohen de Herrera. For example: “This oneness is
described by Herrera as the nature of the Ein Sof, which would entail
the view that everything is one in God and moreover that God is one
inasmuch as he is infinite and many inasmuch as he manifests himself in
being. In this view, the essence of the world is nothing other than the
revealed aspect of God. As Spinoza would later argue in his Ethics, this
God, i.e., the Ein Sof, therefore remains the immanent cause of all
things. Assuming this pan(en)theistic view of the Ein Sof in the Puerta,
Dunin-Borkowski adds that what the Kabbalists teach concerning the
one-and-all is an age-old philosophical heritage. This is what Spinoza
would have recognized in Kabbalah and referred to in a letter to Henry
Oldenburg as a tradition of the ancient Hebrews that he acknowledges.”*

*The big difference between Spinoza and his community wasn’t regarding
this conception, it was that Spinoza believed that which is called God
doesn’t want anything, it just is.*

### **Perhaps not that light…**

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbc387f1-d4ec-4f3c-9b44-263e1bb9609d_400x515.jpeg)

People often ask me how they can develop a bit of intuition in relation
to population genetics. If they want a gentle introduction, I point them
to John Gillespie’s [Population Genetics: A Concise
Guide](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0801880092/geneexpressio-20).
For 2021 “best practices,” Matt Hahn’s [Molecular Population
Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878939652/geneexpressio-20)
might be best. Finally, for masochists who also want books that can give
them a workout, Lynch & Walsh’s two volumes, [Genetics and Analysis of
Quantitative
Traits](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878934812/geneexpressio-20)
and [Evolution and Selection of Quantitative
Traits](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198830874/geneexpressio-20),
fit the bill.

But for me, the Platonic ideal of a population genetics text remains
Hartl & Clark, [Principles of Population
Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20).
I learned population genetics from the 3rd edition in the early 2000’s,
and also have a copy of the 4th edition. It’s far more extensive than
the Gillespie book, isn’t as intimidating as Walsh & Lynch, and probably
is more relevant for the non-scientist than Hahn’s book.

To get utility out of [Principles of Population
Genetics](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878933085/geneexpressio-20)
you don’t really need to know much more than algebra, and it will
provide you with the theoretical scaffold you need to really understand
population genomics and its gusher of data.

### **Genomics Survey Time!**

If you have a bit of time, I have [15 question
survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FWQNZZ6) for **people in
genomics**. Trying to collect some information about the field in the
beginning of the 2020’s.

### **Over to you**

As always, I welcome paid-subscriber comments and your reading
recommendations and suggestions. They never disappoint.
