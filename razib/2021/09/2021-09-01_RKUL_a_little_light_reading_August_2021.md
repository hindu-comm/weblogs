*Thanks for **[subscribing](https://razib.substack.com/subscribe?)** to
**[Razib Khan’s Unsupervised Learning](https://razib.substack.com/)**.
August brought paid subscribers three major pieces. Here’s a sampler of
them for those of you who are not paid subscribers. If you are, you will
find some follow-up notes throughout.*

### **[Steppe 2.0: would you swipe right on a steppe brother?](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe) (part 4 in the continuing “steppe series,” following on [Steppe 1.0, Going Nomad](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-10-going-nomad), [Steppe 1.1a: A nowhere man's world](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11a-a-nowhere-mans-world), and [Steppe 1.1b: culture vultures descend](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11b-culture-vultures-descend), with [Entering Steppelandia: pop. 7.7 billion](https://razib.substack.com/p/entering-steppelandia-pop-77-billion) as a prologue)**

Here is my perhaps ominous conclusion:

> To the early European farmers to the west or the villagers in the
> Indus Valley far to the southeast, the Yamnaya and their descendants
> must have seemed like barbarous monsters. They arrived as packs of
> young men, gluttons for meat, living precariously out of wagons and
> ephemerally in yurts, while worshipping violent and arrogant sky-gods.
> But the Yamnaya also had to adapt their society to the new conditions
> of existence they’d unleashed, developing new folkways and inculcating
> traditions and customs in their youth that would stand the test of
> time. They continued to adapt and change to survive and push forward,
> beyond the horizon as their forefathers had. They had to become a new
> cultural superorganism, fit to inherit the future.

### **[Under the skin: The genetics and natural history of human pigmentation](https://razib.substack.com/p/under-the-skin)**

Instead of just applying genetics to history, this post emphasizes the
functional variation and evolutionary history of a particular
characteristic, skin color, and how it may play out into the future:

> And yet despite its social significance, an air of evolutionary
> mystery still clouds the origins of variation in skin color in humans.
> The scientific literature on why humans became dark-skinned is far
> thinner than the dozens of methods to predict blue eye color. This
> situation is partially a function of the forensic utility of
> predicting eye color, but it is also due to the fact that the origins
> of dark and light skin color in human populations are poorly
> understood. Current theories cannot explain the origins of much of the
> variation we see, though current genomic methods can tell us that
> natural selection was extremely strong around genes associated with
> pigmentation.

### [Should we get "woke" on genetics and behavior?](https://razib.substack.com/p/should-we-get-woke-on-genetics-and)

A much longer review of [The Genetic
Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20),
which I already wrote about for
[UnHerd](https://unherd.com/2021/07/do-genes-determine-intelligence/).
Here’s the conclusion:

> We also know that biology is not everything, but*[The Genetic
> Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20)*
> reminds us that biology is a factor we ignore at our own peril when we
> craft social policy. On the grounds of equality, one might argue that
> gender segregation in sports is unjust. But the standard retort would
> be based on the reality that men and women differ substantially on
> average when it comes to their physical characteristics. In 2021, we
> now have the technology to plumb the depths of our human nature. The
> results may not always be to our liking, but the facts preceded us,
> and ultimately they are unchangeable. The quest for justice always has
> to be conceived of as the art of the possible, and genetic differences
> have always been part of those possibilities.

### **[Hungarians as the ghost of the Magyar confederacy](https://razib.substack.com/p/hungarians-as-the-ghost-of-the-magyar)**

This is a free post, but I wanted to resurface it since it is written in
the long-form discursive style more common in my paid posts:

> But despite the extinction of their genes, the Magyars live on in
> posterity. Árpád and Stephen I are immortal in the memory of a whole
> nation whose sons still commonly bear the name Attila. Genetically,
> the Magyars are but a ghost, but culturally they remain with us,
> vibrant and vigorous, the most numerous and assertive of the Uralic
> people. We all know that historical memory and ethnic identity can be
> protean, but the Magyars of today illustrate this starkly. The
> descendants of Slavic peasants, German knights and Walloon artisans
> have repopulated the land they call Magyarország, and cherish the
> memory of Magyar hillfolk who transformed themselves into nomadic
> warriors and terrorized Europe for a century before it was their turn
> to defend what had become their civilization against the Mongols and
> Turks. Sometimes language, myth and legend live on long after flesh
> and blood have been washed away.

There is now a [new
preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.458211v1.full.pdf)
that puts Hungarians in their proper historical context (though the work
is mostly about ancient Serb/proto-Serb populations).

### **Podcasts**

On the *Unsupervised Learning* podcast, my guests and I have dipped into
a huge variety of topics over the last few months:

-   [Jared Rubin: Christianity and
    Capitalism](https://razib.substack.com/p/jared-rubin-christianity-and-capitalism)

-   [Ruben Arslan: sex, intelligence &
    fitness](https://razib.substack.com/p/ruben-arslan-sex-intelligence-and)

-   [Myra MacDonald: the shadow wars in the Indian
    subcontinent](https://razib.substack.com/p/myra-macdonald-the-shadow-wars-in)

-   [Maximilian Larena: the most Denisovan
    ones](https://razib.substack.com/p/maximilian-larena-the-most-denisovan)

-   And here are the [currently ungated
    podcasts](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) all in one
    place.

[Jared
Rubin](https://razib.substack.com/p/jared-rubin-christianity-and-capitalism)
is the author of [Rulers, Religion, and Riches: Why the West Got Rich
and the Middle East Did
Not](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N0Y8DGK/geneexpressio-20),
a title that is clearly calculated to get attention. But in my
discussion with him, you note how serious scholarship can be applied to
topics that may seem sensationalist. If you were a skeptic of Max Weber,
I would suggest you listen to this podcast, because Rubin makes one of
the best cases for why ideas matter for material outcomes.

If Rubin is focused on the big picture of the past, [Myra
MacDonald](https://razib.substack.com/p/myra-macdonald-the-shadow-wars-in)
shines the light on a very specific area of the present, the Indian
subcontinent. The author of [Defeat is an Orphan: How Pakistan Lost the
Great South Asian
War](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06X9CS9SW/geneexpressio-20),
and a journalist with 30 years of experience in India, MacDonald offers
her perspective on the latest geopolitical shifts in the region, and
what it portends for our future.

The month’s other two podcasts dealt with different ways to study human
variation using genomic data. [Ruben
Arslan](https://razib.substack.com/p/ruben-arslan-sex-intelligence-and)
is by training a psychologist, but uses genomic methods to answer
evolutionary questions. In our podcast we begin by talking about his
test of an evolutionary psychological hypothesis proposed by Geoffrey
Miller in [The Mating
Mind](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038549517X/geneexpressio-20),
and discuss the application of genomics to understanding variation in
psychometric traits. [Maximilian
Larena](https://razib.substack.com/p/maximilian-larena-the-most-denisovan),
in contrast, uses genomics to answer questions relating to the “deep
history” of our species. In my conversation with Max we discuss his
recent finding that the indigenous people of the Philippines may have
had the greatest proportion of Denisovan ancestry of any human group,
and a major revision to Peter Bellwood’s “first farmer” hypothesis for
the peopling of Southeast Asia due to the latest genetics work.

### **You Make Me Want To Read**

In [Steppe
2.0](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe),
[Ashwin](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe/comments#comment-2711886)
references [Cannibals and Kings: Origins of
Culture](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00570A3GE/geneexpressio-20),
an excellent book:

> Excellent as always. On pastoralism and patrilineality, this reminds
> me of a discussion in Marvin Harris' 'Cannibals and Kings' which
> argues that pastoralists were patrilineal because although they
> engaged in "external warfare", their home followed right along with
> them.
>
> To quote: "Pastoralists usually go to war in order to lead their stock
> to better pasture, so “home” follows right along behind them. Hence
> the expansionist warfare of pre-state pastoral peoples is
> characterized not by seasonal long-distance raiding from a home base,
> as is the case among many agricultural matrilineal societies, but by
> the migration of whole communities—men, women, children, and
> livestock."
>
> The quintessential example of a non-pastoral matrilineal society are
> the Nayars, a militaristic matrilineal caste from my home state of
> Kerala. Although, as Harris also discusses, of course matrilineal
> doesn't really mean that men have less power etc
>
> There's a lot more in the book on the differences between external and
> internal warfare and its relationship with patrilineality etc.

In [Should we get "woke" on genetics and
behavior?](https://razib.substack.com/p/should-we-get-woke-on-genetics-and),
[FdB](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/) responds:

> 1\. There's a lot of this, in terms of public response to these
> arguments, that I know about from personal experience.
>
> 2\. There's a big piece from a very prominent mainstream publication
> coming out about this book next Monday which is going to force all
> this out into the public debate (and onto Twitter) and I suspect that
> Paige will get cancelled again. Which is a shame but I know she was
> expecting as such.

### **A Facebook Page for Razib Khan’s Unsupervised Learning**

Recently a European subscriber asked me where she could find the type of
people who are interested in the content she reads here, in real life.
There are many places where you can find people, but I decided to create
a [Facebook
Page](https://www.facebook.com/RazibKhansUnsupervisedLearning) for the
Substack to make things convenient for readers. I just set this up, but
this is probably the best way to eventually find “like-minded” folks
both online and in person.

### **Over to you**

As always, I welcome paid-subscriber comments and your reading
recommendations and suggestions. They never disappoint.
