In the mid-1990’s a 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered in Kennewick,
Washington. The finding triggered a massive cultural, political and
scientific storm that would take two decades to dissipate. This was the
now infamous [Kennewick
Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man), one of the few human
paleontological remains that might elicit recognition in the average
person on the street, like the *Australopithecus*
[Lucy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(Australopithecus)). Though
the original
[reconstruction](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33170655)
of Kennewick Man looked suspiciously like Patrick Stewart, Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of *Star Trek The Next Generation* fame, the physical
anthropologists working on the skull later concluded that Kennewick
Man’s morphology was [most similar](https://web.archive.org/web/20061210135223/http://www.tri-cityherald.com/tch/local/story/7997434p-7890471c.html)
to that of the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan. But Kennewick Man
was not fated to remain just a scientific curiosity. Controversy soon
swirled over whether the native people of the region, like the Umatilla
Indians, should have a veto over access to the remains as per the
“[Native American Grave Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_Graves_Protection_and_Repatriation_Act) .”
Bizarrely, [Norse Neo-Pagans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/09/10/pagans-tribes-scientists-battle-over-ancient-bones/b69c5214-aa3a-4e47-bad2-e28eb6ea9882/)
asserted a rival claim to Kennewick Man as an ancestor, due to the
forensic reconstruction, which implied to them that this individual may
have been related to European peoples. Though the debate died down over
time, in 2015
[DNA](https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2015/01/first_dna_tests_say_kennewick.html)
from the remains confirmed that Kennewick man was of Native-American
genetic heritage. After this analysis was done, in 2017 he was finally
reinterred, as per the wishes of the native tribes of the region.

For me, as a teen in the Pacific Northwest at the time, Kennewick Man
was the only real North American archaeology story I was aware of. The
news media loved it, reveling in the bizarre controversies and
highlighting the numerous political and scientific conflicts, as well as
the hijinks of the eccentric Neo-Pagans. What I did not know then was
that away from the media circus, a revolution in our understanding of
the origins and spread of humans across North America was coming to a
simmer. A model called “[Clovis
First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture) ” was being
overturned by new results, and awareness was dawning among
paleoanthropologists that their longstanding framework no longer
adequately explained the data coming in. By 2020, the generation-long
transition from the old orthodoxy has finally been completed. We are now
in a more nuanced, and yet still uncertain, understanding of the human
arrival in North America.

Archaeology now tells us with a high degree of confidence that humans
were in North America more than 20,000 years ago.+++(5)+++ And genetics now
suggests those first peoples may not have been the ancestors of
contemporary Native Americans.+++(5)+++ In the last few years, new data and
methods have uncovered tantalizing and previously hidden strands of
ancestry connecting tribes and ethnicities in the Amazon rainforest to
the indigenous people of Australia and Papua New Guinea, ancestry
totally lacking in modern indigenous North Americans or Siberians.+++(4)+++

### **The Pleistocene Blitzkrieg**

The Clovis First model was attractive because it was simple, elegant and
explained much of the data. The arrival of modern humans at the end of
the last Ice Age, around 13,000 years ago, coincided with the rapid
extinction of many large land animals in the New World. It is at this
time that human remains and artifacts begin to appear all over North
America in significant numbers. Some sites appeared more ancient, but
most researchers believed that there were problems with the radiometric
estimates that produced those inconveniently older dates for them.

Archaeological sites associated with the Clovis Culture appear in the
record 13,000 years ago. The view was that Siberian hunters crossed over
from Eurasia to North America via Beringia, the “lost continent”
subsequently inundated by sea-level rise after the melting of the ice
sheets.+++(4)+++

These Siberians brought with them spears with distinctive bifacial
points, first discovered in Clovis, New Mexico, in 1929.+++(4)+++ They were
big-game hunters, and in three hundred years, they expanded across the
virgin territory of North America, which was rich in mammoths, bison,
sloths and horses. Not coincidentally, these animals soon went extinct.
They came, they hunted and they extirpated the native fauna, contrary to
the recent stereotype of the continent’s indigenous people as
natural-born conservationists.

Humans were an invasive species in the Clovis First framework. Their
rapid sweep across the continent can be analogized to the spread of
rabbits across Australia. North and South America were assumed to have
been free of humans until the end of the last Ice Age, so megafauna
presumably had no fear of the humans when they first arrived. And, just
like the arrival of an invasive species, the massive human population
growth fueled by seemingly unlimited resources in big game was followed
by resource exhaustion, as the prey animals became scarce or went
extinct, and the Clovis Culture disappeared. The collapse of the Clovis
Culture then ushered in the numerous subsequent cultures and societies
of North and South America.

There are many points where the Clovis First hypothesis still delivers
insights. Early human remains in the New World only begin showing up
around Clovis and after. The only DNA
[extracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzick-1) from a Clovis site
indicates that modern indigenous people in the New World share broad
genetic similarities with the Clovis hunters. They are their descendants
or at minimum descended from closely related early people. The Clovis
people and modern Native Americans are both genetically branches of
Siberians. When it comes to their archaeological impact, Clovis was like
nothing else that came before in the New World. Their spears exhibited
more craftsmanship and were produced in such large volume the wasted
tips began to litter the landscape. And their skill at hunting seems to
have had no parallel before in the New World, judging by the extinctions
they precipitated. While ground sloths went extinct more than 10,000
years ago on mainland North America, they persisted for another 6,000
years on Cuba. It was the arrival of humans that triggered this island
extinction.

But now, we know that the Clovis people were not the first humans in the
New World. The earlier sites researchers have long had to explain away
as dating mistakes, were probably not as it turns out aberrations, but
the true legacies of long pre-Clovis human occupation.



![Paisley
Caves](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa16c0e5c-45a6-4298-afeb-bc6b4e854d73_2048x1386.jpeg)

### **Before Clovis**

Sites older than Clovis have been under excavation for decades. But no
human skeletons have been discovered [much earlier than
Clovis](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/four-of-north-americas-oldest-human-skulls-dont-look-much-alike).
The general consensus in the late 20th century was the ‘tools’
discovered at these locations might actually be dismissed as naturally
occurring wear and tear generating flint flakes. But over time, the
evidence that these locations were valid sites of human occupation that
predated Clovis became difficult to rebut. Even though Clovis was
indubitably a turning point in the impact of human habitation in North
America, the scientific community now broadly agrees there must have
been modern humans in North and South America before Clovis.

Oregon’s [Paisley Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_Caves#Recent_finds) show
evidence of human occupation around \~15,000 years ago, thousands of
years before Clovis. These caves have also yielded human coprolites:
fossilized feces. In 2008, mitochondrial DNA, the maternal lineage,
extracted from these coprolites at the site indicated genetic
connections to Siberia and East Asia. Meanwhile, far to the south, in
southern Chile, the [Monte
Verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verde) site yielded grinding
stones and burned charcoal that date to a similar era.

In 2002’s *[The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America
and Its
Peoples](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00THMCCM6/geneexpressio-20)*
archaeologist Tim Flannery admits that the Clovis First model was no
longer tenable, but also acknowledges that since there wasn’t a
replacement theory or model he was going to write much of the narrative
as if it still held. But by 2021, too much evidence has accumulated for
anyone to just pretend as if Clovis First is the only fully fleshed-out
option. Paisley Caves and Monte Verde were already important sites
twenty years ago which needed to be at least noted, but two new
discoveries in 2020 and 2021 have further bolstered the inevitability of
the conclusions they were pointing us to, sealing the fate of the
hobbled old paradigm.

First, in 2020 the
[publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2509-0) of
results from Chiquihuite Cave in Central Mexico pushed back the human
occupation of North America to at least 19,000 years ago (and perhaps
33,000 years ago).+++(5)+++ That team found nearly 2,000 primitive tools from an
unknown culture at the site. In the year since the publication of the
paper, the consensus among archaeologists has grown that this much
earlier range is correct dating and so humans did indeed occupy the New
World prior to 19,000 years ago. The Chiquihuite Cave does not just
smash Clovis First, it is also far older than the more conservative
dates in Paisley Caves and Monte Verde.

And now, in September of 2021, another publication confirms the very
early human occupation of the New World. Ancient footprints in New
Mexico have now been dated to [23,000 years
ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/science/ancient-footprints-ice-age.html),
using carbon-dating of the plant detritus in corresponding soil layers.
Archaeologists seem to agree that there is not much dispute that this is
a solid finding. Carl Zimmer in *The New York Times* quotes
archaeologist Ben Potter, who is skeptical of sites much older than
Clovis in North America. Potter says, “I’d like to see stronger data,
and I don’t know if it’s possible to get stronger data from this
particular site...If it’s true, then it really has some profound
implications.” This is a rather gentle objection, and for my money,
points to the reality that these results are quite convincing on their
face.

But archaeology is not the only discipline that’s been unsettling our
previously tidy narrative of the origins of the native people of the New
World: genetics has begun revealing strange connections to the
populations of Australia and Papua New Guinea in South America in the
last five years. Combined with archaeology, these wildly unexpected
results open up unforeseen new possibilities, though without any tidy
new successor certainties.

### **Out of Siberia**

Despite the Australian [genetic
connections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26196601/) of some native
peoples in the New World, physical anthropologists have long observed
that the indigenous people of the New World are most similar to the
populations of East Asia, in particular Siberia, when it comes to their
morphology. All these populations have high frequencies of
[shovel-shaped
incisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel-shaped_incisors#Genetics),
as well as other characteristics like relative hairlessness and high
cheekbones.+++(4)+++

Genetics broadly confirms this pattern. The closest modern relatives of
Native Americans are the peoples of eastern Siberia. And yet there have
always been some stubborn wrinkles in this story. New World populations
also show connections to Europeans, West Asians and South Asians on many
genetic markers, while genetic-clustering algorithms find them shifted
away from East Asians toward these other groups. The evidence from
maternal and paternal lineages: the mtDNA and Y-chromosome respectively,
is the clearest. Haplogroup
[X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_X_(mtDNA)#:~:text=Haplogroup%20X%20is%20a%20human,and%20the%20Horn%20of%20Africa.)
on the mtDNA is found across West Eurasia and in North America. More
than 90% of the paternal lineages in the New World are haplogroup
[Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_Q-M242). Q is a “brother”
lineage to haplogroup R, famously found from India to Ireland.+++(5)+++ The two
main branches of R1: R1a and R1b are associated with Indo-Europeans,
while R2 is mostly found in Iran and India. Q itself is also found in
low but significant fractions across Central, West and South Asia, as
well as Siberia.



![Native American populations are closest to East Asians, but shifted
toward
Europeans](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4301b06-d028-4914-a773-d3a1ace68c1d_1380x879.png)

These patterns do not fit a neat model where Native Americans descend
solely from the ancestors of modern East Asians. But we know now that
the human family tree does not actually resemble a branching tree so
much as a complex network anyway. In
[2013](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25020958), the DNA
of a boy buried on the shores of Lake Baikal an estimated 24,000 years
ago was analyzed using new techniques in paleogenetics ushered in by the
[sequencing of the
Neanderthal](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/genome-projects/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/Science_Green.pdf)
three years earlier. Named for the site, he is known as the Mal'ta boy,
and his overall genetic makeup is unlike any human alive today.

The distant Siberian ancestors of the Mal'ta boy separated from the last
common ancestors of Europeans and West Asians some 38,000 years ago. But
they were clearly of the same branch of ancestral humans that migrated
north out of the Middle East 50,000 years ago, as opposed to those that
swept eastward through India, and into East Asia and Australia. The
population to which the Ma’ta boy belonged is called “Ancient North
Eurasian” (ANE), and it left many descendents. ANE ancestry can be found
across Europe, in West Asia and South Asia, as well as in some parts of
East Asia and Siberia. But, perhaps the most surprising result was that
20-40% of the ancestry of modern Native Americans derives from the ANE.+++(4)+++
Meanwhile, 10-20% of the ancestry of Northern Europeans, from England to
Russia, ultimately comes from the ANE, explaining the suggestive and
mysterious connections between the two populations. The Mal’ta boy
himself seemed to be Y-chromosomal haplogroup R, the ancestral lineage
that exploded in the last 5,000 years with the Indo-Europeans (the
prehistoric
[Yamnaya](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe)
were 30-40% ANE in ancestry).+++(5)+++

Subjecting ancient and modern DNA results to advanced computational
models, we now see that the vast majority of the ancestry of
contemporary Native Americans derives from an admixture between ANE
tribes and early East-Asian Paleo-Siberians over 20,000 years ago. Out
of the fusion of these two populations emerged the group that followed
big game eastward, onto the tundra of Beringia, that vast subcontinent
between North America and Siberia. Eventually, these ancient Native
Americans moved southward as the ice sheets retreated, opening a path
into the Americas proper, and brought with them the seeds of the
catalytic Clovis Culture that would transform North America.

But that still leaves us with the question of who the earlier people
were that left their footprints in New Mexico and tools in the caves of
Mexico more than 20,000 years ago. They were a different kind
altogether.

### **They come from a land down under?**

Just as with the Mal'ta boy, it took new technology to uncover one of
the most surprising, and still most mysterious, results to come out of
New-World archaeology and genetics. Using much denser marker sets
(hundreds of thousands as opposed to dozens of genetic variants) that
allowed for exploration of statistical associations between hundreds of
world populations, researchers uncovered a previously [unidentified
affinity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982469/) between
some native populations in the Amazon and the aboriginal peoples of
Australia and Papua New Guinea.+++(5)+++ The lab had set up an open-ended model
to compare populations against each other, and test for evidence of gene
flow across them. In the vast majority of cases, the data charted no
special connection. But to the researchers’ surprise, a few groups in
the Amazon seemed to have gene flow from Australians and Papuans.

The sensational find of a connection between Oceanian populations that
everyone believed diverged from the ancestors of Native Americans 50,000
years ago, and populations deep in the Amazon nearly 10,000 miles away,
was greeted with skepticism, even internally within the lab. But the
researchers checked and cross-checked the result for months, and it
held. They concluded that earlier and more primitive techniques had
simply not been powerful enough to pick up statistically robust
signatures. It is hard to imagine Papuans or Australians migrating
across the Pacific to South America. Rather, it seems likely that an
ancient population more closely related to aboriginal Oceanians than to
East Asians was present in Siberia more than 20,000 years ago.+++(4)+++ In
[2018](https://www.science.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aav2621),
ancient DNA from a skull in Brazil dated to more than 10,000 years ago
also exhibited a detectable genetic connection to Australians and
Papuans. Other remains from that period, including the DNA from the
Clovis site, did not. This means that the Australian/Papuan-related
population did not mix evenly into ancient indigenous populations, and
may have arrived earlier and been absorbed.

In 2021, a [consortium assembled 
DNA](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2025739118) from indigenous
people from the Pacific to the Atlantic in South America, compared the
individuals to ancient and modern DNA from across the world, and
discovered that low levels of Australian/Papuan-related ancestry were
far more widespread than had earlier been thought. The faint affinity to
Australo-Papuan populations extended across much of South America. They
also found variation of the proportion of this ancestral component even
within tribes, with some individuals carrying far more than others. This
suggests that the admixture may have been relatively recent, and may not
have been well-mixed across the population.

All of these genetic results were surprising, and do not fit neatly into
the standard models and expectations. But what’s exciting is how they
are perhaps less amazing now that archaeologists have confirmed that
modern humans were almost certainly present in the New World 20-30,000
years ago.

### **Along the ocean’s shore**

We are now beyond Clovis First, but the path forward is still unclear.
The certainty that some humans were present in the New World before
20,000 years ago will require reevaluation of many sites whose findings
were considered implausible. Archaeologists digging in Mexico will be
working at Chiquihuite cave, discovered only in 2012.

And geneticists have also contributed novel results in the last few
years. The people of the New World are relatively genetically
homogeneous, likely due to the bottleneck of Beringia. The big game
hunters who occupied Beringia between 20,000 to 15,000 years ago were
clearly descended from known Siberian populations, and the vast majority
of modern indigenous American ancestry derives from this stock. But now
genetics also adds the twist that a small but detectable fraction of
ancestry in South America comes from an unknown population distantly
related to today’s aboriginal Australians and Papuans.

So with all this, are we equipped to say who the first Americans were? I
think when all is said and done, we will find that the earliest humans
in the New World were more closely related to the Australians and
Papuans, rather than modern East Asians. In other words, the first
modern humans who were present in the New World did not contribute much
ancestry to today’s Native Americans at all. Only the ancestors of
today’s indigenous South Americans genetically absorbed these earlier
people who preceded the Beringians. This must have occurred more
recently than 15,000 years ago when the Beringians arrived, and if the
evidence for variation in ancestry in contemporary Amazonians is
replicated, pockets of these earliest Americans may have persisted down
to the relatively recent past.

The fact that we can say these people are related in some way to today’s
Australians and Papuans draws our modern eyes to the tropical western
Pacific. But it is more likely that these relatives of the
Australo-Papuans were ancient Siberians. The world 30,000-40,000 years
ago was different enough that we have to tread very carefully as we wend
our way, mostly blindly, back to these forks in the family tree. The
geographical connotations of modern terminology can mislead more than
they illuminate. A [great deal of circumstantial
evidence](https://www.gnxp.com/WordPress/2020/03/30/the-deep-origins-of-east-eurasians/)
indicates an ancient bifurcation between populations ancestral to modern
East Asians and another group with closer connections to Australians.
Today Y-chromosomal haplogroup D is found in Japan, Tibet, and the
Andaman Islands. This is a clue to the likelihood of an ancient
population in East Asia that was absorbed by expansionist millet and
rice farmers widening their range outward over the last 10,000 years.
The Australo-Papuan ancestry in modern indigenous South Americans likely
derives from a northern branch of these long-lost ancient East
Eurasians.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49e5fdf7-6733-4cba-bb13-b4f3eb2ce9ba_919x650.png)

But how did these people arrive on the shores of America when vast ice
sheets spanned North America and Siberia, blocking movement eastward?
Long before the revolution in dating and genetics, archaeologists in the
American West were developing a theory that the peopling of the New
World [could have occurred through a coastal
migration](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15138-0_5).
This model appeals because a fully [ice-free
corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_of_the_Americas#Emergence_and_submergence_of_Beringia)
in the interior of North America does not seem to have opened up until
13,000 years ago when the Clovis people began to expand. Today the
theory is necessary because it is quite clear modern humans arrived in
North America more than 20,000 years ago, when we know glaciation
blocked conventional landward migration out of Beringia into North
America. So how does the theory run? The earliest Americans were related
to a now-extinct group in coastal Siberia, distantly related to today’s
Australo-Papuan populations. They were ocean-oriented and likely had
small boats that they used to move along the shore. Many researchers
believe that they exploited North-Pacific kelp forests, which can
support maritime foragers. As they migrated eastward, they found
isolated refugia surrounded by glaciated territory in western North
America. Eventually, these earliest Americans arrived in America’s
Pacific Northwest, south of the ice sheets, and settled in places like
Oregon’s Paisley Caves.

The paucity of material remains, and the minimal impact on megafauna
from these putative earliest arrivals leads us to suspect that these
early humans existed at low population densities. The tools in
Chiquihuite, Mexico are quite primitive and exhibit little change over
time. Eventually, these earliest Americans moved southward and were the
first occupants of the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. Here their
population was larger, and the arrival of Beringians 13,000 years ago
did not totally overwhelm them in the southern continent as it did in
North America. Nevertheless, these unknown people who occupied the New
World for nearly 10,000 years before the arrival of the ancestors of
modern indigenous people remain like ghosts to us, leaving faint traces
in the genetics of local populations, and only the most tenuous of
material legacies. Their ecological footprint was light enough not only
to allow for the flourishing of Pleistocene megafauna until the arrival
of the Beringians, but it was also minimal enough that archaeologists
denied their existence for decades, and geneticists failed to pick up
their trace scent. But now? Both archaeologically and genetically, it’s
a whole New World.
