Your time is finite. Your phone and the internet stand ready to help you
squander it. Here are my latest picks for spending it well instead. Feel
free to add more in the comments.

### **Books, what else?**

Steven Pinker’s newest book, [Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems
Scarce, Why It
Matters](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08WK3JNLT/geneexpressio-20),
is out at the end of the month. It’s Pinker, so it’s buzzy, to put it
mildly. All I’ll say at this point is that Pinker of course makes topics
like Bayesian reasoning accessible and engaging.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175c965c-cf32-47d5-aea4-e8276bfa9795_1868x404.png)

Perhaps a counterpoint to Pinker’s new book is [Thinking, Fast and
Slow](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00555X8OA/geneexpressio-20).
This book by Danny Kahneman came out about ten years ago, at the peak of
the “we’re actually irrational” boom triggered by the irrational
exuberance that led up to the financial crisis in 2008. I think we’re
looking back at that period with some regrets now due to the replication
crisis. There was perhaps excess, shall we say irrational, exuberance,
about irrationality itself. Books like Pinker’s are a corrective, but it
is useful to look back to where we began.

That being said, sometimes we do think fast, due to instincts and
intuitions. Carole Hooven’s [T: The Story of Testosterone, the Hormone
that Dominates and Divides
Us](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08HKX6GWH/geneexpressio-20)
is still an excellent read if you want to know about that. The last
decade has seen a few books which turn out to be propaganda that
testosterone doesn’t matter for cognition and behavior. It does. And
it’s not always proximately rational (“hold my beer”).

When it comes to reasoning and rationality, Hugo Mercier’s [The Enigma
of
Reason](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XWFM3PP/geneexpressio-20)
is well worth reading if you want to know the likely evolutionary
origins of our faculties. The answer to the enigma is more Cicero than
Sextus Empiricus, persuasion rather than illumination.

Twenty years ago Gerd Gigerenzer was making the argument that we’re
actually not that irrational in [Adaptive Thinking: Rationality in the
Real
World](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000SBEBME/geneexpressio-20).
Kahneman and Amos Tversky got famous, but Gigerenzer might have been
closer to being right.

If you didn’t read Richard J. Haier’s [The Neuroscience of
Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/110746143X/geneexpressio-20)
when it came out, I’d recommend you see to that. It mixes cognitive
neuroscience and psychometrics to unusually satisfying effect.

Finally, [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human
Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us
Smarter](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00WY4OXAS/geneexpressio-20)
is an excellent argument that individual intelligence isn’t enough to
explain our social complexity. Our “social brain” is the critical part
of the puzzle people often miss when they talk about “rationality.”
We’re more than the sum of our parts.

### **Thought**

[Can Progressives Be Convinced That Genetics
Matters?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/can-progressives-be-convinced-that-genetics-matters)
This is a breathless 9,000-word profile of Dr. Kathryn Paige Harden. I’d
recommend just reading [The Genetic
Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20),
but the reaction to the piece underscores that it’s going to be a hard
slog to convince progressives that genetics matters.

Freddie deBoer, everyone’s favorite heredity-aware communist has been on
fire, [Why Resist Blank Slate Thinking? For One, Look to No Child Left
Behind](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/why-resist-blank-slate-thinking-for)
and [Genes Believe in
You](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/genes-believe-in-you). NCLB
probably started a chain reaction of toxic policies that echo down to
the present. It was one of the worst things that George W. Bush enacted,
though we let others loom larger.

Also, a YouTube for Zoomers with Harden and DeBoer, [Genes, education
and society round table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2CRlUW9grs).

[COVID-1889](https://www.slowboring.com/p/covid-1889). Persuasive that
yes, it was a coronavirus pandemic that hit us in the late 19th century.
We know that there has been [natural selection around coronavirus
epidemics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221007946)
in East Asians 20,000 years ago.

[Why have there been so few COVID deaths in
Japan?](https://noahcarl.substack.com/p/why-have-there-been-so-few-covid)
One thing about COVID-19 is that it’s a natural experiment run in a lot
of places. There’ll be a lot of retrospective analysis in the next
decade based on the gusher of data being generated.

[Towards the abolition of animal
farming](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/towards-the-abolition-of-animal-farming).
I think it won’t be abolished, but it will become a niche, and much more
humane.

[The Other Afghan
Women](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-other-afghan-women)
and [In US Drone Strike, Evidence Suggests No ISIS
Bomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html).
Basically, the US abetted and aided human rights horrors, and inflicted
them upon the Afghans as well, for the whole period of US intervention.
It’s weird in some ways that the media is reporting it now, but I’ve
heard from friends and acquaintances in the military for twenty years
that we don’t know half a percent of the horrors that our military
inflicted in Iraq and Afghanistan (both nations have had more than
200,000 civilian deaths confirmed due to civil war since 2001).

### **Data**

[Effective population size for culturally evolving
traits](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.09.459561v1).
Cultural evolution is a field that’s exploded in the last decade. Keep
an eye on it.

[Human generation times across the past 250,000
years](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.07.459333v1) and
[Different historical generation intervals in human populations inferred
from Neanderthal fragment lengths and mutation
signatures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25524-4).
Generation times have fluctuated historically. Males have longer
generation times than females and East Asians seem to have longer
generation times than Europeans.

[Evolution of cytokine production capacity in ancient and modern
European populations](https://elifesciences.org/articles/64971). The
evolution of immune systems is a big deal. Disease has always been with
us, and we’ve always been adapting to it.

[Population differentiation of polygenic score predictions under
stabilizing
selection](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.459833v1).
This looks like a major result, and relates to the traits in [The
Genetic
Lottery](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B091MQ771M/geneexpressio-20).

[Comparing Heritability Estimators under Alternative Structures of
Linkage
Disequilibrium](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.08.459523v1).
Related to the topics in the previous paper. Heritability matters
because we care about our risk for schizophrenia or type 2 diabetes.
These are heritable traits.

[Multiple hominin dispersals into Southwest Asia over the past 400,000
years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03863-y).
Paleoanthropological results are essential to understanding the
inferences derived from ancient DNA and human evolutionary genomics, and
this group is starting to publish its monumental results.

### **My Two Cents**

There’s still no free lunch, free subscribers; my most in-depth pieces
for this Substack are beyond the paywall.

I’ve continued my series (part
[1](https://razib.substack.com/p/entering-steppelandia-pop-77-billion),
[2](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-10-going-nomad),
[3](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11a-a-nowhere-mans-world) and
[4](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-11b-culture-vultures-descend))
on the Eurasian grasslands, [Steppe 2.0: would you swipe right on a
steppe brother? - The biological and social consequences of Yamnaya
nomadism](https://razib.substack.com/p/steppe-20-swipe-right-on-a-steppe):

> The Yamnaya-powered transformation of Europe and Asia more than 5,000
> years ago was a social and economic revolution, with the explosion of
> nomadic pastoralism across the Eurasian steppe. Its downstream
> linguistic and cultural consequences are with us to this very day:
> billions of us speak Indo-European languages, and we preserve those
> ancestral religious beliefs both in the shared mythology of the West
> and in the living religious traditions of India. To premodern minds
> untouched by science, **the rise of obscure tribes to world conquest
> would have been evidence of divine providence and fate**. Theirs was a
> world of miracles, and the gods always chose favorites. By the 20th
> century, supernatural explanations had foundered on the shoals of
> scientific materialism. But unless you were a Marxist, history was a
> matter of narrow description of particular places and times, rather
> than general theoretical narratives that explained the arc and ebb of
> societies and cultures. It was one damn thing after another, with
> broader patterns attributed to the vague laws of probability.

Also, my extended review of Harden’s book, [Should we get "woke" on
genetics and behavior? - The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social
Equality, a progressive behavior geneticist weighs
in](https://razib.substack.com/p/should-we-get-woke-on-genetics-and).
There was a lot of stuff relating to human population genetics that
didn’t make the final cut in the UnHerd
[review](https://unherd.com/2021/07/do-genes-determine-intelligence/),
and I put it all in the Substack post:

> Three years ago David Reich, a human population geneticist at Harvard,
> wrote an op-ed for The New York Times where he asserted that “since
> all traits influenced by genetics are expected to differ across
> populations... the genetic influences on behavior and cognition will
> differ across populations, too.” Harden disagrees with this position,
> saying that she is “skeptical more generally of anyone who claims
> clairvoyance about what the science of human genetics will tell us.”
> **But Reich’s argument comes out of his mastery of a century of
> evolutionary genetics, not some magical crystal ball.**

### **Discussion**

Here are the [currently ungated
podcasts](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) all in one place.
All my podcasts go [ungated](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/)
two weeks after their Substack release. So I encourage subscribers on
the free plan who’d like to automatically get them to
[subscribe](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/) to that podcast
stream

Again, I talk most Fridays on
[Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@razibkhan) about some genetic
or historical topic. Join my
[club](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/RazibKhansUnsupervisedLearning)
for notifications. These conversations are more unscripted and free-form
than podcasts. I can report that I have been hailed for my assertive use
of the mute option. It’s best for everyone, I swear. I also heckle my
friends. Not a fan of the “this is more of a comment than question...”
contributions, but I do always take legit questions!
