I'm counting down to the new year here by re-releasing favorite past episodes from the archives of my other podcast homes each day until 2021. Hope you'll discover a memorable voice or two you might have missed before. These episodes are free for all; next on the docket are new episodes for paying subscribers only, including conversations with [Armand Leroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Marie_Leroi) and [Alina Chan](https://twitter.com/Ayjchan).

[Alexander Ioannidis](https://profiles.stanford.edu/alexander-ioannidis) is not the most famous Ioannidis at Stanford. But perhaps he should be!

In the summer of 2020, [he led a study](http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/177265/Native-American-gene.pdf?sequence=1) that seems to confirm gene flow of Native American ancestry into Polynesia long before Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue. On some level, we always knew and suspected this. How could people who crossed the whole Pacific not have arrived on the American mainland? Also, the existence of the American sweet potato in Polynesia indicates some contact.

But we had always assumed it was cultural. Using the “best-of-breed” genetic methods Alex found that there were clear signs of ancient Native American ancestry in the people of the Marquesas. Over 45 minutes in May of 2020, we discuss technical details, the archaeological and anthropological relevance to contacts between Pacific and American peoples, and future directions for his research.
