Life comes at you fast. Sometimes faster than others. Given the events that have upended assumptions about international relations, shaken the financial system and riveted the world since Razib pre-recorded this week’s paid-subscriber podcast with [Samo Burja](http://samoburja.com), founder of political risk consultancy [Bismarck Analysis](https://www.bismarckanalysis.com/#/), we recorded a bonus mini-episode for all subscribers. On this extra episode of *Unsupervised Learning* Razib talks with Burja again, focusing solely on current geopolitical events.

Are things going according to the Russian plan? How long will the Russians stay, and how will this impact Europe? And what are the long-term consequences of the Western economic response to Russia’s incursion for the world’s geopolitical balance? Samo addresses head-on what he believes are the likely ramifications for the US, Europe, Russia and Asia.

Welcome back to the multipolar world, dominated by Keynes’ old animal spirits (paying subscribers, I highly recommend [the week’s premium podcast](https://razib.substack.com/p/samo-burja-bismarck-analysis-and?s=w) with Samo where he talks about his firm [Bismarck Analysis](https://www.bismarckanalysis.com/#/), and how they see the world). If you are among the many struck by the irrationality of Putin’s behavior, Samo’s approach to breaking it down without cant or emotion should be required listening.
