# Cyber Monday 50% discount, plus who I read and why

### Substack savings, reading lists and my must-read newsletters

The best things in life are free, and/or at the library. For me, that set overlaps slightly with a handful of things also worth investing in. In a separate post, [I detailed](https://razib.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-test-your-dna) why I think everyone who can afford to, should own a Whole Genome Sequence for themselves and all their loved ones. Now, I have three more favorite categories of picks for you.

1.  ~~Best for the early bird: Annual subscriptions to this newsletter
    are discounted 50% starting now. That discount lessens by 1% per
    hour until 11:59 pm EST Monday, Nov. 28.~~ Two notes: 1. Cyber
    Monday is the one day each year I give a steep discount. And 2. I
    set this as a forever discount, so if you’d like to lock the rate in
    long-term, today’s the day.

2.  Book lists for my 10 must-read book subjects follow below.

3.  My 10 favorite Substack reads (many with Cyber Monday discounts)
    follow below.

### **Books, what else?**

1.  [Population

### **With friends like these**

Indispensable reads from a handful of my favorite thought-criminal friends and other assorted original thinkers

1.  [Erik
    Hoel](https://erikhoel.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    of [The Intrinsic
    Perspective](https://erikhoel.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    is either a writer who swallowed a scientist, or a scientist who
    swallowed a writer. Whichever it is, he’s become a must-read for me,
    and I encourage you to
    [subscribe](https://erikhoel.substack.com/subscribe) now as he has
    just left academia and gone paid (here’s our recent
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/erik-hoel-neuroscience-is-dead-long-live-neuroscience)).

2.  [Chad Orzel](https://chadorzel.substack.com/)’s [Counting
    Atoms](https://chadorzel.substack.com/). Chad’s a physicist, so you
    can expect posts on that topic, but also commentary on science in
    general, culture and science fiction. He’s been on my podcast
    [two](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/chad-orzel-quantum-jumps-across-science-and-writing)
    [times](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/chad-orzel-a-brief-history-of-timekeeping),
    and I’ve enjoyed his output from our parallel posts in the “science
    blogosphere” for over fifteen years.

3.  [Full Stack
    Economics](https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    by [Tim
    Lee](https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page).
    I trust Tim to keep me up to date on the economic scene because he
    doesn’t bring his agenda to the table (here’s my
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/timothy-b-lee-reporting-on-the-intersection-between-policy-and-economics)
    with him).

4.  [Leighton Akira Woodhouse](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/)
    of [Social Studies](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/). An
    erstwhile academic sociologist and current writer and documentarian,
    Leighton has excellent commentary on broader social issues like the
    rise of the [New
    Class](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/p/the-new-clerisy) as
    well deep-dives into the chaos engulfing [San
    Francisco](https://leightonwoodhouse.substack.com/p/sf-supervisor-gordon-mars-quiet-ties)
    (here’s our
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/leighton-woodhouse-from-the-labor-left-to-the-radical-center))

5.  [Sarah
    Haider’s](https://sarahhaider.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    [Hold that
    Thought](https://sarahhaider.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    consistently puts quality over quantity. She’s one of the few people
    who came out of New Atheism who seems to have avoided being sucked
    up into the woke-memeplex or the anti-woke memeplex (here’s our
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/sarah-haider-from-ex-muslim-to-gender-atheist);
    Sarah holds the memorable distinction of having cost me a subscriber
    who huffed that they wouldn’t give me another cent because I
    platformed Sarah, who dared admit being among the millions who
    listen to Joe Rogan).

6.  [Stuart
    Ritchie’s](https://stuartritchie.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    [Science
    Fictions](https://stuartritchie.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    has nothing to do with speculative fiction, but brings a healthy
    skepticism to the world of “I f\*\*king love science.” It should be
    noted that Ritchie also looks like a hedgehog, but he’s just
    Scottish (I don’t know which is worse, and also, here’s our
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/stuart-ritchie-bad-science-good-science-and-behavior-genetics)).

7.  [Katherine Brodsy’s](https://randomminds.substack.com/) [Random
    Minds](https://randomminds.substack.com/) isn’t exactly random. I
    admire her voice because she says what she thinks and doesn’t seem
    to “read the room” before doing so. Far too often contemporary
    public intellectuals are cagey or engage in ass-covering
    qualifications of the form “I don’t agree with everything
    \[fill-in-the-blank-human\] says, but…” Katherine doesn’t do that,
    which makes her an even more refreshing read (here is our
    [podcast](https://unsupervisedlearning.libsyn.com/katherine-brodsky-from-internet-entrepreneur-to-cultural-commentator)).

8.  [Richard Hanania’s
    Newsletter](https://richardhanania.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page).
    Dick is probably most widely known for his [legend-level
    trolling](https://twitter.com/RichardHanania), but he is going to
    shift his newsletter to
    [paid](https://richardhanania.substack.com/subscribe), and I presume
    produce more content like [his magisterial
    review](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/how-monogamy-and-incest-taboos-made)
    of Joe Henrich’s [The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West
    Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly
    Prosperous](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08KWM6CCS/geneexpressio-20).

9.  [Democracy and Other
    Problems](https://shadihamid.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    is [Shadi
    Hamid’s](https://shadihamid.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    new project, and relates to his recent book, [The Problem of
    Democracy: America, the Middle East, and the Rise and Fall of an
    Idea](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0197579469/geneexpressio-20).
    Unlike some prominent public intellectuals, Shadi has always seemed
    less interested in whether you are one of the “cool kids” than
    whether you have something interesting to say (he for one,
    consistently does, in my opinion).

10. [Glenn Loury’s
    Substack](https://glennloury.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=profile_page)
    (with very frequent appearances by John McWhorter) is a must-read
    because very few academics with tenure are as candid as Glenn about
    the state of the American intellectual scene in this decade. Tenured
    academics, especially outside of the hardest of sciences, are
    [extremely
    conformist](https://sarahhaider.substack.com/p/how-tenure-fosters-conformity),
    so I’m very happy to support Glenn (here is a [podcast I
    recorded](https://razib.substack.com/p/glenn-loury-heterodox-academy-of#details)
    with him).

Have a good Monday. Thank you, sincerely, for supporting my writing and conversations.
