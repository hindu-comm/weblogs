Happy 2023! An old friend recently asked me to help her make a reading list for the new year. She reflected on how easy it is to spend hours reading daily, especially online, only to get to the end of the day and realize almost every word of it was ephemeral. She wondered, what if she just read 20 pages of something worthy every day? By the end of the year, no matter how much time she wasted online, she’d have at least finished a couple of dozen books she’d always meant to read.

It reminded me of an eccentric History adjunct I had in college. Ken had no patience for anything conventional, including enduring undergrads’ tortured history papers. At the beginning of each seminar, he gave us a simple schedule. Every day (including weekends) of the term, we were to read the next 50 pages in a book on that seminar’s theme. And every class meeting, we answered a few quick quiz questions from deep in that week’s hundreds of pages, small details you’d probably miss if you only skimmed. Letter grades were assigned solely based on the quizzes (and solely at the department’s behest). Other than that, we just discussed and debated the texts. By the end of the term, you’d have absorbed a dozen texts, start to finish, on a single theme.

Ken’s classes were cake for me. That pace was slower than the rate at which I usually consumed narrative history. But I watched plenty of friends go into the term confident of an easy A only to promptly crash and burn.

Fifty pages a day is a nice average for a year. You finish a solid 18,000 pages in twelve months. But most of us are pulled in so many more directions than a 1990’s undergrad, so what about my friend’s more modest daily twenty? It still nets you 7,300 pages over the course of a year and is light enough that even if you have a brutal week, you can easily catch up on a quiet Friday night in, or a weekend afternoon.

I know a lot of you, like me, think in terms of titles, not pages. Your 2023 reading lists, or highlights thereof, are welcome in the comments. But if anyone wants to jump into a preset 2023 reading list like the ones Ken used to pass out, below you’ll find three themed lists that by my rough count, each run close to 7300 pages of text. Page counts exclude indexes and end notes. I’m happy to help with alternate recommendations in the comments, since many will have already read some of the core texts in each and want to swap out certain titles.

### **Humans, who else?**

If you’ve been reading my book recommendations for long, you can probably close your eyes and recite half of these titles. What can I say? They’re canonical for a reason. I’m happy to propose good alternatives to swap in if you want to share in the comments which books you need to switch out.

### **A Golden Age Dawns: genomics’ early decades and paleoanthropology’s maturity**

At the heart of this Substack project is my awe at everything the 21st century’s genomics revolution can now tell us with precision about our species’ past. Those rough drafts and updates to conventional wisdom constantly emerge as peer-reviewed papers from the world’s foremost labs. It’s still early days for genomics as a field, so actual books taking into account the latest findings are few and far between. But this list includes the young domain’s few popular must-reads, plus my pick of the pre-genomic texts that set the scene for the age of miracles we’re living through. In contrast, books on human evolution date back decades, and there are now many gems that we can reread almost like prequels we’ve already spoiled with lately revealed facts and updated frameworks.

### **Don’t say they didn’t warn you**

I’ve read every book (some multiple times) on the first two lists, but among all the books I can personally vouch for in this set are some I have yet to get to that people I trust have been insistently recommending. It’s probably nice to live in a time when you can look back over your lifetime and laugh at how overblown prior decades’ most alarmist predictions have proven. Unfortunately, that time is not ours. The Cassandra-like critiques and warnings in some of the more recent books that follow are often so much less dystopian than our actual intellectual climate today, you’d be forgiven for yearning for their feared scenarios.
