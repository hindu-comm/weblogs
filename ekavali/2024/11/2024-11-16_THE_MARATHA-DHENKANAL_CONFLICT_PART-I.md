</div>

In the heart of Odisha, lies Dhenkanal, a place where history and nature dance in harmonious cadence. With its regal palace adorned in timeless splendor and lush forests whispering ancient secrets, Dhenkanal weaves a tapestry of resplendent wonder. The blue, waters reflecting the blue sky and the towering hills, and morning mist rising from the valley are unforgettable. According to one version of a local folklore of Dhenkanal, a savara tribal named Dhenka was ruling over that territory in ancient time .He was defeated by a ruler of the nearby region and was put to death. Before his death, he had requested that the place be named after him .Thus, this is perhaps how Dhenkanal got its name.

#### Brief history of Dhenkanal till 16th century

Dhenkanal was ruled by many empires including the Mauryas,the Mahameghavahanas and the Guptas.The history of the Dhenkanal can be properly studied from the time of the rule of the Bhaumakaras who started their rule in Odisha in the 8th century. Dhenkanal was a part of the kingdom and was under the direct administration of the feudatory chiefs of the Bhaumakara monarchs,who ruled from Guhadevapataka (near Jajpur).Sulkis were the feudatory chiefs who ruled over a territory known as Kodalaka mandala(comprising of the Dhenkanal region) As Sulkis grew too powerful ,Bhaumakaras extirpated the rule of the Sulkis and divided the Kodalaka mandala into two feudaory groups-the Tungas(who ruled Yamagritta mandal) and Nandodbhavas(Airavatta mandala). Afterwards, Dhenkanal came under the rule of the Somavamsi/Keshari rulers from 9th-12th century, Eastern Ganga kings from 12th-15th century and then followed by the illustrious Suryavamsa Gajapati kings (from 1435 AD till 1540 AD).Gajapati Kapilendra deva was the famous ruler of the Suryavamsas,stretching his empire from the Ganga river till the southernmost point of the country) .He was succeded by his son Gajapati Purushottamdeva and then by Purushottamadeva’s son Gajapati Prataparudra deva-the last great king of the Suryavamsa Gajapati dyansty. According to the genealogy of the Dhenkanal royals,Prataparudra had an able general named Hari Vidyadhara,who helped him in war in the Deccan region(most likely against the army of famous Krsnadevaraya of Vijayanagara or any prior campaign in Deccan).Hari was awarded a jagir in Karamole Patna(which is around 30 km north of Dhenkanal) by Prataparudra for his bravery. Hari occupied many nearby areas of his jagir and later established his capital at Dhenkanal. He was the founder of the line of Dhenkanal royal family, whose descendants are still around.(this is a short version of the account of how Hari became the king)

#### **The advent of the Marathas**

After the Mughal occupation of Odisha in 1592 AD, most of the feudatory states(who were under the Gajapati of Odisha, ruling from Cuttack)of Odisha submitted to the Mughal Subedar. The Subedar didn’t interfere with the affairs of native chiefs in exchange of tribute. Dhenkanal was more or less independent under the descendants of Hari Vidyadhara. The Dhenkanal royals had good relations with the Gajapatis of Khordha.who were the main ruling house in Odisha from 1592 AD and were in charge of the daily affairs of the famous Jagannath Temple of Puri.From 18th century, the Nawab of Bengal(who swore allegiance to the Mughal Crown) was in charge of Odisha and his deputy Naib Nazim was based in Cuttack.  
  
The Marathas rose as a major power under the Bhatt Peshwas of Pune(although the Chhattrapati was the nominal head of the kingdom/confederacy) in the subcontinent, challenging the Mughal Supremacy .They had captured a huge portion of India and took over the administration in the name of the Mughal Crown.Their eyes fell on Odisha from early 1740s.The campaign against Odisha and Bengal was led by the army of a Maratha general Raghuji Bhonsle,who had become quite powerful by then. Raghuji’s family was related to Chhatrapati Shivaji and his descendant, Chhatrapati Shahu, and afterwards Raghuji became the founder of the Nagpur state of Bhonsles.

The Marathas made in roads to Odisha repeatedly and clashed with the Nawab of Bengal,Alivardi Khan.The local rebels against the Nawab had joined hands with the Marathas.The Marathas were pushed back from Odisha by the forces of the Nawab of Bengal repeatedly(the Nawab made a few tactical alliances for this cause).After the repeated plummeting of Marathas, the Nawab was tired of the conflict and signed a treaty with the Marathas in 1751, handing them the territories of Odisha that were south of the Subarnarekha river and north of Ganjam district of Odisha (Ganjam and regions of South Odisha were ruled by independent kings,who weren’t under the Nawab) and ending the 10 yr conflict. Some native kingdoms of Odisha changed hands quite often, during the tussle between Marathas and Alivardi Khan.

#### **Marathas attack Dhenkanal and Kalkala’s revenge**

Dhenkanal was ruled by Raja Damodar Bhramarabar in 1741 AD. There were many feudatories of Dhenkanal and one was the chief of Kalkala, which lied to the east of Dhenkanal.The chief of Kalkala was upset with Raja Damodar as the Raja had rejected the marriage proposal of his daughter. Kalkala revolted against Dhenkanal,but the latter subdued the former. With the entry of Marathas ,the Kalkala chief found an opportunity for revenge. The Kalkala chief invited the Marathas to invade Dhenkanal.Marathas were also supported by a general who rebelled against the Nawab-Mian Marzan.  
  
The combined army of Marathas and their allies clashed with that of Raja Damodar.Damodar lost the battle and also lost his life.It’s believed that Marzan killed him in the battle.  
  

#### The Revolt of Jainarayan and his attempt for revenge

<div id="§" class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top">

</div>

</div>

</div>

There’s a debate whether Damodar had any so.He was succeeded by Jagannath Brhmarabar or better known as Jainarayan in 1743 AD(some assume that Trilochana Singh succeeded Damodar but later evidences show that it was Jagannath).There are two theories about Jagannath’s relation with Raja Damodar-(a) he was Damodar’s son (b)he was his nephew ie Damodar’s brother Benudhar’s son.Whatever be the case,he was chosen by the nobles to be Damodar’s succesor. Marathas had almost entire control of Dhenkanal .Waiting for his revenge,Jainarayan saw an opportunity when Sheo Bhatt,the first governor of the Marathas at Odisha, was dismissed for his inability to collect revenue for Nagpurkar Bhonsles in 1764. Jainarayan rebelled and murdered Bhatt’s adopted son Bulli Khan and took over Bulli’s jagir and seized his cavalry. Bhawani Pandit,the next governor of Odisha, had to rush and subdue Jainarayan’s revolt.  
  
Jainarayan wasn’t done yet. Sambhaji Ganesh was the governor of Odisha in 1769.He didnt get along with the head of Nagpur State-Janoji Bhonsle(successor of Raghuji Bhonsle) .Capitalzing on this hostility among the Maratha chiefs ,Jainarayan wrote a letter to the British appointed Nawab of Bengal, Muhammad Reza Khan, to invade Odisha and also complained about how Marathas were looting Dhenkanal.He stated in his letter:

> *"His country has been plundered by the Marhattas.Sambhuji Ganesh who
> is staying at Jaipur has rebelled against Raja Januji. Consequently
> the Raja's people have come from the Deccan to summon him to . Nagpur.
> The whole country from Balasore to Cuttack is undefended and Sambhuji
> has designed to loot it. Should a letter of encouragement be sent to
> the writer, he will stay in the country with a satisfied heart. Sends
> to Murshidabad his brother, who will relate all particulars to the
> Khan".*

Well,we can’t be sure whether Reza replied to Jainarayan’s letter but it seems Reza stuck to the previous treaty with the Marathas and chose not to cross Subarnarekha.The second attempt of Jainarayan for revenge, turned futile.

In 1771,Jainarayan was succeded by a young enterprising person, who was a distant member of the Dhenkanal royal family .He was Raja Trilochana Singh , who would become the face of resistance against Marathas in Odia history and would etch his name in the history of Dhenkanal and Odisha.
