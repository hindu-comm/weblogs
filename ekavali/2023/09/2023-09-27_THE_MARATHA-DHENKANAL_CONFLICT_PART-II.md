In [Part-I](https://ekavali.substack.com/p/the-maratha-dhenkanal-conflict-part) ,events that occurred in Dhenkanal till 1771 have been discussed. Trilochana Singh or Trilochana deva had just ascended the throne. Trilochana deva’s predecessor Jainarayan had no sons. So,what could be the relationship of Trilochana with the Dhenkanal royals? Trilochana Singh was a native of Bhimnagari Dandapata (modern Motagan) and is mentioned to be a distant relative of the Dhenkanal kings, as per some sources. He was most likely chosen by the nobles as the next ruler  
  
Sudhakara Patnayak(the editor of Shri Brajanath Badajena’s works) makes a conjectural analysis and assumes Trilochana to be an usurper. However, there is no concrete evidence for that.

#### **THE SAMARA KABI/POET**

Before delving deep into Raja Trilochana’s career, it’s important to know about poet & writer Brajanath Badajena,who served as a court-poet of Raja Trilochana. Brajanath Patnaik was born to Balukeswar Patnaik, in a family of poets and administrators, in 1730AD. He was an expert in many languages and received the patronage of rulers of Keonjhar,Dhenkanal and Khordha.He spent his last days at the court of Gajapati Divyasingha deva-II of Khordha. Badajena wrote many prose, poems and ballads. The most famous of his works is the Odia poem Samara Taranga(War waves),which describes the war between Raja Trilochana and the Maratha army. Badajena was a direct witness to the events. According to historian BC Ray(who has written a book about the period of Maratha rule in Odisha)- ‘*Samara Taranga has less of eulogical expressions and exaggerations. Most of the facts mentioned when verified with whatever materials available from contemporary Marathi, British and Persian sources are found to be quite reliable and true. As a literary work ,the poem reveals some historical events which weren’t known so far”*

#### THE UNYIELDING TRILOCHANA

After ascension, Raja Trilochana Singh stopped paying *peshkash (*tribute) of 60000 *kahanas* to the Maratha governor of Odisha, as the tension between the two parties had increased over time.A letter to the Raja of Nagpur by a Sena Bahadur, hints that Marathas were suspicious that the British influenced Raja Trilochana to not pay the tribute to the Maratha governor Rajaram Pandit. The suspicion was on the ground that the Raja of Dhenkanal had stationed few hundred British soldiers and sepoys in his fort. But according to Badajena, the peshkash was stopped due to some ‘unfortunate hostility’, which provides further evidence of the heightened hostility between Dhenkanal and the Marathas. Rajaram pressed hard for tribute but still Trilochana didn’t reply.

#### THE WAVES OF WAR BEGINS

Rajaram advanced towards Dhenkanal with a huge army to chastise Raja Trilochana.He was assisted by Manju Chaudhary, a famous banker from Cuttack. Trilochana’s army consisted of 10000 paikas or infantrymen,1000 Telangas(who used a pointed weapon named Dhankuna) , 500 fierce Nagas and some western soldiers. The Maratha army reached till Motari, which was was 8-10 miles from the Dhenkanal fort and served as an entry to the kingdom .Trilochana sent his army to restrict the Marathas. The messenger of the Dhenkanal army warned the Marathas to back off but the latter didn’t pay any heed. What followed was a furious assault by the Dhenkanal forces that scattered the Maratha army. The Marathas under Rajaram fell into utter confusion and were forced to retreat with most of the soldiers either injured or dead. While retreating, they dropped a lot of baggage, which fell into the hands of the soldiers of Trilochana  
  

#### DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO THE LOSS

A British officer sent a letter(dated 22nd Jan,1781) to the Gov. General of Bengal,Warren Hastings mentioning about the battle- “*a considerable force which was sent to Dhenkanal from Cuttack was forced to return.*” Maratha general of Nagpur State Chimnaji Bapu Bhonsle (who played a role in the next campaign against Dhenkanal) briefly mentioned in a letter a year later- “ *The Zamindar of Dhenkanal troubled the Subah of Cuttack last year*”

Badajena writes that the rout of the Marathas by Dhenkanal was such a humilation ,that the Marathas made a show of pre-planned retreat to hide their defeat and started carrying out a propaganda that Trilochana’s men treacherously attacked them while they were returning.

#### REVENGE AND SIEGE BY THE MARATHAS

Rajram and Manju were fuming for revenge after the debacle. Fortunately the Maratha general from the Nagpur ,Khandoji Bhonsle or also known as Chimnaji Bapu Bhonsle ,or just Chimnaji was passing through Odisha and was planning to invade Bengal for *chauth*.On hearing about the Maratha defeat,Chimnaji turned back his army to Cuttack.Rajaram & Manju met Chimnaji and urged him to take on Dhenkanal,stating that Dhenkanal has set a bad example forthe native feudatory chiefs of Haraharpur,Kujang and Medinipur and if these rulers rise in similar rebellion against the Marathas,then the Maratha control of Odisha would be in danger.Chimnaji realized the gravity of the situation,and took a huge force of 30000-40000 men against Dhenkanal.Chimnaji had to wait for sometime and planned to attack once the monsoon was over.Given the difficulty in terrain, Chimnaji took the help of Chaitan Das of the Dhenkanal army , who had by then switched allegiance to Marathas over some differences and a Maratha sardar Kishtemaraja who knew the routes of Dhenkanal very well  
  
The Maratha army advanced and camped at Sathiabatabila, which was not far from the Dhenkanal fort.Trilochana prepared his defences and sent a vanguard to attack the Maratha camp.There are two versions of what followed. Historian BC Ray quotes from the letter of Bhavani Kaiu of 1780 AD and says that the vanguard couldnt gather strength after seeing the huge number of Maratha soldiers.Trilochana had to come & himself encourage them and sent some extra men from the fort.This attempt turned futile as the Marathas strongly repulsed Trilochana’s men ,who had to retreat inside the fort.Historian R.P Mohapatra quotes from Samara Taranga and mentions that Trilochana had knowledge of the Maratha plan for assault.He came down with a force, annhilated the vanguard troops of Marathas that were led by Chaitan Das and Kishtemraja and returned to the fort. With such contradiction,a proper analysis can be done when new evidences are available  
  
Things weren’t easy for Chimanji’s army,as to face bombardment and fire from Dhenkanal fort continously. There was shortage of food in the camp. On top of that,a local hill tribe Chuars harassed and raided the Maratha camp frequently. Chimnaji had to appeal to his ally,the Raja of Keonjhar for help. The king of Keonjhar sent an army of 20000,for the assistance of the Marathas. The raid of the Chuars was completely halted with this extra force.

#### THE BRITISH MOVE

The British were closely observing this siege from Calcutta.Warren Hastings,the then Governor general of Bengal,wanted to isolate the Nagpurakar Bhonsles from the possible four power anti-British alliance.(the Marathas under Nana Phadnavis,the Nizam of Hyderbad,Hyder Ali of Mysore and Nagpurkar Bhonsles) which could be detrimental to British interest in India. He wanted to be in friendly terms with Nagpur and thus sent them grains during the siege.  
  
With a renewed food supply and additional troops, Chimnaji concentrated his full strength on assaulting the Dhenkanal fort. But still the Dhenkanal forces stubbornly defended the fort for 18 days.  

#### TREATY AND AFTERMATH

  
Things after that are a bit unclear.Badajena mentions that Raja Trilochana had to retreat from the the fort considering the safety of his citizens and keeping other factors in mind.R.P Mohapatra opines that it was a show of retreat to maintain tactical goodwill with the Marathas.At the same time, Samara Taranga describes the distress, despair and gloom in the Maratha camp under Chimnaji and Rajaram .The chiefs made a treaty with Trilochana,where the terms included that the tribute of Dhenkanal would be halved and rights,priviliges and titles of Raja Trilochana would be recognized.The treaty was made sometime in Jan-Feb,1781 AD.

However in this state of things there could not exist any loyal submission to the power of the Maratha sovereign. After the Maratha withdrawal from Dhenkanal,Trilochana sent his troops against Keonjhar for revenge.He soundly defeated the Keonjhar king and captured many of his generals.He also clashed with the kings of Tigiria, Athagarh, Pallahara and took possession of a part of their lands.  
  
After a successful and stormy career, Raja Trilochana passed away in 1785.there were no serious conflicts between Marathas & Dhenkanal kings after that.  
  
The Gajapati of Khordha,Dibyasingha deva-II ,whom most of the native chiefs of Odisha respected and considered themselves as symbolically subordinate to him, conferred the title of Mahindra Bahadur to Raja Trilochana for his heroic resistance against Marathas.The title is still used by the royal family of Dhenkanal.  
  
Rosita Forbes,a British lady traveller who visited the Dhenkanal Princely state in the 20th century wrote the following about Raja Trilochana Mahendra Bahadur:

> *Unlike the other Eastern chiefs, who sought peace by paying tribute > to the fierce Maratha, Trilochan would never acknowledge the > suzerainty of the marauders, on the contrary, he wrested considerable > territory from them and his successors continued to enforce their > supermacy over neighbouring chiefs, one of whom was the chief of > Hindol. He used to make an annual present of sweets as a mark of > tribute".
