The Tiger and the Dragon: the great Indo-China divergence

When one thinks of ‘ancient civilisation’, five names usually come to mind: Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, India and China. There were other ancient civilisations, like the Olmecs in Mesoamerica, one of the founding ‘New World’ riverine civilisations independent of the Eurasian transcultural network, but these five names invoke the mental picture that we associate with the first men who tamed the wilderness of nature, became the first farmers and built the first cities. This picture is not entirely correct, for there were farmers in Anatolia thousands of years before Babylon and Egypt, but mental pictures are often about perceptions and not technical realities. Out of these five, only four go back to the 3^(rd) millennium BCE; the perception of Greece as ancient is a testament to the dominance of occidental civilisation in recent years. Of those four, only two survive today in any meaningful form related to their polytheistic past: India and China. These two ancient civilisations started on vast alluvial planes with rivers rich in sediment carrying the silt necessary for agriculture to flourish. For millennia, the river systems of the Indus, the Ganga, Yellow and Yangtze rivers fed two great nations, and the agrarian surplus gained from this land became the backbone of urban civilisation and occupational differentiation in the two civilisations; it also led to thriving and densely populated cities, with Pāṭaliputra, the Mauryan capital, having almost half a million residents at its peak, and Chang’an, the Imperial Tang capital, at over a million.

**Pre-Modern GDP and the Indo-China picture**

When people speak of economic growth or discuss the vast populations of India and China, which have created massive consumer markets and the largest urban middle class in the world, they forget that the historical reason for this vast population is that India and China are simply the oldest civilisations in the world and have *always* had the most people. India had more people than Sweden, even in *10,000 BCE.*

<div class="captioned-image-container">

This certainly comes down to a combination of geography and extensive state formation for multiple millennia, leading to various waves of urbanisation. This article will discuss the economic histories of the two countries and the great divergence between the two that started more than fifty years ago now, but what has to be kept in context before we even begin is that economic might and GDP in the modern, post-industrial world are not as much of a function of population as they were in the ancient world. Whenever these two countries are compared, we see infamous charts talking about India contributing to more than 30% of the world’s GDP , with the usual historical GDP data taken from Angus Maddison. This is all well and great, but it always leaves the most important point unsaid in favor of brass jingoism: India and China together make up more than half of the world’s population. Such charts comparing the two countries seem to lead to the unspoken assumption that it is India’s ‘rightful’ place in the sun to be a global economic giant, just like China. India will eventually get there on its own, just like before.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

This is not true, and it obscures something very important: there was no guarantee China would ever become the industrial giant it is today; no arc of history or Han manifest destiny guaranteed such a future. It happened with careful planning, decades of correct industrial policy measures, and ever-increasing state-capacity to govern such a large nation. There was a playbook to follow, and China consciously followed it to the dot.

*By 2016 they will account for around 40% of world trade, compared with 15% in 2006. That’s roughly the position they occupied about 200 years ago. Economist Angus Maddison has calculated that in the 1800s, China and India together accounted for 50% of global trade. It is impossible to make predictions about the integration of these countries into the global economy, because past events, such as Germany’s reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain, don’t compare. After those occurrences in 1990, a large number of people entered the global economy, but the numbers pale in significance when compared with the China–India double whammy. Like it or not, the world’s future is tied to China and India.*

It is 2025 today; forget 40% of global trade combined; India does not even clock 5% of international trade. This article by the Harvard Business Review, quite mild in its praise of the ‘India Story’ in the early 2000s, was and is emblematic of a lost sense of ephemeral optimism that burnt out all in a decade when the twilight of the global economic boom led to double-digit real growth in India, fueling the belief that it might become another China. No attention was ever given to the structural reasons that India never became the first China to begin with, and no attempt was made to understand what the blueprint to successful industrialization was, despite there being live examples of countries that had just finished the journey: Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Japan.

What China did, and what India did not, was nothing very novel, and it did not just involve “economic liberalization” or “opening the free-markets” and “cutting red-tape” as is popular perception. The purpose of this article is manifold, it briefly aims to go over the origins of modern capitalism, and understand how the first ‘rich countries’ got rich, how these policies were replicated by some poorer countries and what were the exact reasons for the Indo-China divergence that happened less than two living generations ago. It is clear that Fabian Socialism and Maoism, the dominant economic ideologies of the older Indian and Chinese elite, failed tremendously, but why these ideologies even took a hold, how exactly did they fail, and how China buckled the trend by succeeding, is what we want to look at here. We also want to look into the post-war years, leading up to the 1980s, and the period after that. We can use many countries for such a case study, and in subsequent articles, we will look at all of them individually. Still, we begin the comparison with China due to the instant comparator it provides in terms of scale and population. Lee Kwan Yee’s record in Singapore is extremely impressive. Still, a small *dirigiste* city-state whose economy runs on a combination of financial services, corporate tax haven and concentrated human capital is not very analogous with India.

**The Great Divergence and the Infant Industry Model**

We have already highlighted how GDP data from the ancient and medieval world was a function of population, geography, and the duration of civilisation. This trend only started changing after productivity differences in populations grew to such an extent that more economic value could be created by tiny Switzerland than half of Asia, and these productivity differences came about due to a combination of intellectual, cultural, institutional and policy differences. This is the famous ‘Great Divergence’ between Europe, especially North-Western Europe, and the rest of the world, and while Economic historians disagree on when it exactly begins, mostly people agree that it was completely over by the beginning of the 20^(th) century, with Japan being the only Asian nation that managed to semi-industrialize and compete with the European powers on its own terms. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5^(th) century saw the end of European centralization and the rise of feudalism with the overbearing hand of the Roman Catholic Church in all walks of European life, the ‘Dark Ages’ had begun. It was not until *1936* that Rome had a population of 1.5 million inhabitants, a number it had actually achieved two thousand years ago at the peak of the Roman Empire. There was complete intellectual decline in Europe for almost a millenia, even the ability to read Ancient Greek had been lost. To highlight the absolute poverty of Western Europe in the sciences in the middle ages, we can look at private correspondence letters from 1020 CE of two Catholic scholars – *Raoul of Liège and Ragimbold of Cologne*. These two lacked basic knowledge of geometry and were unaware the angles of a triangle make up 180 degrees, unaware of what an exterior or interior angle was. The two were unaware of the square root of two, as it wasn’t a rational number. Just five centuries later, a few parts of Europe such as England, the Low Countries and regions of Northern Italy had already surged well ahead of the rest of the world, reaching an adjusted GDP per capita of almost $1500 (1990 Intl.)

In comparison, India sees complete stagnation and a slow decline from the Mughal Period onwards, and by the 1500s, Northwestern Europe is already thrice times as rich as India and China, even before the Industrial Revolution takes off. The divergence begins around the 1100s-1200s, coinciding with the ‘12^(th) century Renaissance’ when Europe began re-interacting with the Hellenic intellectual tradition that it had lost access to during the Dark Ages. The Abbasid Caliphs like Harun Al-Rashid had preserved a lot of Greek philosophy and translated it into Arabic via their newly conquered Byzantine subjects. The Spanish reconquista of Al-Andalus led to a lot of this knowledge falling back into European hands, spurring a translation movement in centers like Toledo of the entirety of Aristotle and Plato into Latin. This intellectual spurt coincided with the development of educational institutions of higher learning, the establishment of Europe's first universities: Bologna in 1088, focusing on law; Paris in 1150, emphasizing theology; and Oxford by 1167. Scholasticism, a method of critical thought, reached its zenith with Peter Abelard's "Sic et Non" (c. 1122) and later Thomas Aquinas' "Summa Theologica" (1265-1274). The rediscovery of Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis (compiled 529-534 CE) in the late 11th century revolutionized legal studies, influencing secular governance as seen in Frederick Barbarossa's Roncaglian Decrees of 1158. Technological innovations manifested in Gothic architecture, these were the years when Europe built the Notre Dame and Chartres Cathedral.

In England, these changes in intellectual traditions were accompanied with constant institutional changes such as Henry II’s strengthening of land rights and the Baron’s revolt leading to the Magna Carta in 1215. The issue of the powers of taxation was the central dividing line between the English barons and their liege-lord, and parliament was ironically created as the means for a recalcitrant aristocracy in ensuring its protection from the absolute despotism of a monarch. By the end of the English Civil War in the 17^(th) century, the move to a constitutional monarchy had been complete, similarly Holland had established a Republic a century before after overthrowing the Habsburgs in the Dutch Revolt. England witnessed a relatively stable transition to parliamentarianism and had a strong national identity in the form of a centralised nation-state quite early on, unlike the splintered principalities and states of Germany. The highly commercialized and trade-driven economy of the merchant Republics of Italy saw the most rapid growth in the High Middle Ages. Rates of urbanization (20%) were double that of Northern Europe (10%) and Milan had a higher population than London. Innovations in accounting like double-entry book-keeping also came about first in Florence, and the entire Mediterranean trade was controlled by Italian city-states. All these changes had made this part of Europe ripe for rapid transformations, which came about with the Black Death and the Renaissance.

The Black Death was the deadliest plague in history and wiped out as much as \~40% of the European populaton, but the economic effects on the peasant who survived were largely positive. Scarcity of labor and abundance of land led to higher wages, and the loss of bargaining power in the Manorial system. The quality of life in England and Holland went up while it stayed relatively constant outside the North Sea region. In England, GDP per capita went from 714 dollars before the Black Death to 993 dollars in the period of 1348-1500. In Holland, this was from 876 dollars to 1301 afterwards. For a lot of reasons, the North Sea countries had reacted like pseudo ‘market-economies’ after the Black Death, that is, they followed supply-demand cycles as wages rose due to high demand, and cost of capital and land went down, all of which increased labor productivity and GDP per capita. They were not perfect market economies, for example, the Peasant’s Revolt in 1381 had started from a series of laws Edward III had passed to to freeze prices of wage labour to pre-1348 levels, circumventing market value increases in wages. Laws (Apparel Acts of 1363) even had to be passed to prevent the peasants from buying fashion erstwhile worn by the elite. These were all eventually squashed, leading to the weakening of serfdom, abolishment of poll taxes and continuation in the erosion of royal power but highlight the pre-modern and feudal nature of England at the time.

By the 17th century, the divergence in institutions and human capital (literacy) had grown due to the Protestant Reformation splitting most of the North Sea countries away from the Catholic Church and due to the investment in human capital in Northern Europe, even before the spread of the printing press. During the Middle Ages, rates of book consumption per capita were highest in Flanders and Italy, however, by the start of the 1500s, the Netherlands and Germany had caught up to them. The average years of schooling for every citizen was 0.5 in England and 1.0 in Holland in the 1500s going up to 1.2 and 1.5 by the 1700s. Literacy rates in England and Holland were more than 40% in the mid-17th century and numeracy rates were much higher than the rest of Europe due to high rates of commercialization and the mercantilist economy. By the 1700s, the systems of capitalism and the liberal governmental institutions that accompanied them in the Anglosphere were also being penned down. The Scottish Enlightenment in the mid 18th and early 19th century had led to thinkers like Adam Smith creating the first treatises that had formalized capitalism as an economic ‘science’, and the Anglo-Dutch transcontinental empires were characterized by a lot of the elements we associate with a modern free-market economy; the East India Companies were Joint-Stock corporations you go buy shares in, and the South Sea or Tulip Bubbles were one of the first example of overinflated pricing of stocks due to market speculaton leading to a market wide financial crash.

By the 1800s, the industrial revolution had come about due to a combination of these factors: high human capital, plenty of deposits of coal, rapid technological innovation, parliamentary democray, enclosure acts. This lead to annual growth rates of around \~1.3% for the UK from 1822-1900 (which was astronomical for the time, since Holland was growing at only 0.7%). What is important for us to understand for the purpose of this article is that the *laissez-faire* economics advocated by Adam Smith was not some social reality in England at this time, and it was not accepted economic wisdom that was used by the United States or other industrial giants like Germany to industrialize. In fact, England and the United States had a long history of using protectionist policies like tariffs and import substitution combined with export-led growth to industrialize. The best example for this, and one which our readers can instantly relate with, is the rise of the English textile industry. In the middle ages, England was mostly an exporter of raw wool and cotton, chiefly to the advanced Low Countries of Belgium and Holland. Over a few centuries, it had systematically begun transforming itself into a textile exporter using protectionist policies by Edward III and the later Tudor monarchs, and then used it’s colonial empire to gain captive markets for it’s exports (the Thirteen Colonies, later India).

Robert Walpole, Prime Minister under George I summarized his ideas on trade as follows ‘*it is evident that nothing so much contributes to promote the public well-being as the exportation of manufactured goods and the importation of foreign raw material*’ and this was followed by a series of legislation such as the Calico Acts of 1700, 1721 that banned the import of manufactured cotton textiles into England, the Wool Act of 1699 also banned the import of finished woolen textiles into the country, other legislation reduced export tariffs on finished goods and on raw materials, while adding tariffs to the import of finished goods. By 1875, more than 50% of all English exported textiles went to India. This strategy, of promoting domestic manufacturing by importing cheaper raw materials and exporting expensive finished products was something all the East Asian countries would follow two centuries later. In fact, one of the main contentions between the American colonies and Britain was that Britain had laws such as the Hat Act, Navigation Acts which forced the colonists to buy hats, tea, tobacco, sugar only from England via English ships (which had gotten it from their colonies). England also had the famed Corn Laws from 1815-1846 that even banned the importation of of grain like corn to keep British farmers protected, the repeal of these laws generally seen as the end of British protectionism.

By the time the British had removed most protectionist measures, their economy was already so advanced and their technology so far ahead of everyone that their manufacturers would dominate global markets. One of the biggest criticisms of ‘free trade, open market’ policy is it does not account for the differential historical development of national industry and commerce. This fact was recognized by the Americans and the Germans back then as well. Alexander Hamilton was probably the first proponent of what is now called the ‘infant industry’ argument, the idea that domestic industry in it’s nascent stages is like an infant that must be protected and nurtured till it grows up to compete with the rest of the world. The argument was further developed by German economists such as Friedrich List who criticzed the British for promoting free-trade because they had already ‘climbed the ladder’ and wanted to kick it away.

*It is a very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations. The English tell the entire world to embrace free trade now, after they have raised their manufacturing power & navigation (by means of protectionism) to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with them.*

This infant industry argument is usually not a part of the traditional classical or neo-classical economic advice given on industrialisation that was followed seriously by the Prussians, Meiji Japan, and the later East Asian tigers of the post-war world. The East Asian (Japan, Korea, Taiwan) relied heavily on an export-led growth model in conjunction with infant industry policies (Singapore and Hong Kong focusing on exporting financial services). Now that we have briefed ourselves on this, we can delve into the Indo-China divergence and realise the policies followed were often very similar to the roadmap laid centuries ago.

**India and China after WWII, the rise and fall of Socialist ideology**

India and China were on a relatively bad footing in the immediate decades after WWII. While we saw how the British had decimated the indigenous textile sector of India with a combination of tariffs, colonialist market capture and protectionism, the British owed a war-debt of more than £1.3 billion (US$ 5.3 billion) to the Government of India, since they had made the Indian State finance all war expenditures in India, pay for half the cost of all capital acquisitions in defence related modernizations and even pay for a large portion of the cost of Indian troops stationed abroad. In fact, Britain’s total Sterling debt after the war was more than 60% of the money it had acquired from the United States under Lend-Lease, and India alone held \~40% of this debt. During the course of the war, from 1938-1946, almost 75% of total expenditure was on the military and the budget was completely imbalanced. Money supply went up 500% from 1939-1946 and inflation soared, the WPI (Wholesale Price Index) went up 200% - inflation was over 50% in 1942-1943. This ‘Sterling debt’ was never fully paid back to India, was not convertible to gold, and the Sterling lost it’s status as the reserve currency of the world after the Bretton-Woods agreement, when most of the world’s major economies barring the Soviet Union agreed to peg their currency to the US dollar, with the dollar being pegged to gold at a fixed exchange rate. If this was not enough, the newly partitioned India had suffered gruesome communal violence, especially in Punjab and Bengal, and was immediately plunged into a war with Pakistan over the Kashmir issue in 1947. Pashtun *lashkars* or militiamen supported by irregulars of the Pakistani Army had entered the 96% Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir, citing it’s demographics as the reason for making it a part of Pakistan.

Similarly, the Chinese people had witnessed the long and slow decline of the Qing Empire, the last ruling Imperial Dynasty of China, and faced a ‘century of humiliation’ at the hands of Western powers, as well as by the once subordinate Japanese, who had conquered Korea in 1910 and had launched an invasion of Manchuria, the homeland of the former Manchu-rulers of the Qing. Internally, the fall of the Qing had created a power vacuum and the nation was ravaged by a Civil War between the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, and the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-Shek. After a brief collaboration between the two during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, fierce war broke out again after the fall of Japan, and the Communists led by Mao emerged victorious. The Kuomingtang fled to a small island off the South China Sea, taking gold and silver reserves of hundreds of tons with them to stabilize the newly created Taiwan that was recognized as the successor state of China till 1971, and the CCP led by Mao was left to govern an internationally isolated mainland China.

Thus, in 1950, we find Nehru and Mao, the defacto rulers of the largest nations in the world given a relatively even hand. China did not have representative government, and could utilize it’s sociocultural & ethnic homogeneity to push policy easily without domestic dissent, something which we will see they made ample use of later on. India was mired by internal conflict along many axes: religion, caste, language, ethnicity and ideology but had inherited Asia’s most powerful military with millions of battle hardened veterans from the Great Wars and the strongest Navy and Air Force in Asia. India also had much better relations with the West than China, and could leverage this to great extent as a leader of the ‘Third World’.

India got it’s first aircraft carrier in 1961 from the British, the *INS Vikrant (HMS Hercules)*, while China would not have one till as late as 2012 (!). To highlight the poverty of the Chinese in advanced military tech, they had to pretend to buy the *HMS Melbourne* from Australia in 1985 to ‘scrap it’, and then tried to reverse-engineer the tech to no success, while India was simply sold a carrier straight by the British. Even in areas like Nuclear Technology, the Nehruvian state benefited immensely from civilian technology transfer from the Anglosphere, the CIRUS reactor, built in 1954 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, was a Canadian project to give civilian nuclear energy to India, but was later on used to produce weapons grade-Plutonium for ‘the bomb’. India could very well have had a functioning atomic weapon in the 1960s if the political climate was in favor of it. Still, successive generations of leaders from Lal Bahadur Shastri to Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi displayed extreme hesitation in weaponizing India’s nuclear program. China had likewise acquired atomic technology from outside, from the Soviet Union and had tested their first device in the mid 1960s, after the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The fact that the Nehruvian state lost the 1962 war to a decisively less modern PRC, was a testament to bad leadership and inaction rather than genuine deficiencies in the Indian military compared to the PRC at the time.

What was common to both India and China was an intellectual ruling elite (Nehru, Mao) that was educated on Western classics and sought for solutions from the politico-economic ideologies of post-French Revolution Europe. Nehru and Mao were two wealthy sons of regional elites who were raised on Rousseau, Darwin, Huxley, Kant and Marx, who had grown up reading the exploits of Bonaparte and Washington, and who had decided to fix the rot in their respective countries by latching to the dominant ideology of one or the other European great power in their midst. After WWI, the excesses of crony capitalism and the Industrial Revolution in Europe had created a very fertile atmosphere for socialist and egalitarian thought. Marxism was borne out of this crucible of falling living standards, smot-filled factories, stunted heights due to malnutrition, the senseless tragedy of the ‘Great War’, a complete exploitation of wage-labor at the hands of the owners of the modes of production and inexorablu linked to European Imperialism. In the United States, the ‘Gilded Age’ (1870s-1900s) had led to some of the same problems, and these were dealt by the rise of the Progressives, who wanted to create a centralized bureaucratic government with a welfare state that provided for everyone.

In Nazi Germany, the economic and political failures of Weimar had led to the centralization of power under the National *Socialists*, and every major country had in some way or the other co-oped parts of Marxist ideology to make sure that mass dissent from capitalist exploitation was kept under control. This was a time of increased pushback against the anti-egalitarian modes of government of the Old World, and the end of the aristocratic-feudal system as we know it today. When we keep all this in perspective, it makes a lot of sense that Nehru was a member of the Fabian Society of Democratic Socialists, and Mao was a Marxist-Lenninist revolutionary. In fact, one of the major reasons for the death of Marxist ideology in Europe was the fact that almost all of Europe had adopted the Democratic Socialist model of the welfare state after WWII, and thus taken away some of the biggest drawing point that the communists had held till then (the exploitation of the proletariat at the hands of the capitalist).

Stephen Kotkin, in his *Armageddon Averted (The Soviet Collapse: 1970-2000),* described the disillusionment that had set in even hardline communists by the 1970s when card-carrying members of the party would go to Europe on vacation and see that the modern post-Marshall plan Capitalist giants of West Germany, France or Italy have socialist policies like paid maternal leave, in addition to rapid consumerist growth that raised living standards.

*“In the inter-war period, during Stalin’s violent crusade to build socialism, capitalism had seemed for many people to be synonymous with world imperialism, the senseless slaughter of the First World War, goose-stepping militarism, and Great Depression unemployment. Against that background, the idea of a non-capitalist world—with the same modern machines but supposedly with social justice—held wide appeal. But in the Second World War fascism was defeated, and after the war the capitalist dictatorships embraced democracy. Instead of a final economic crisis anticipated by Stalin and others, capitalism experienced an unprecedented boom, which made the Depression a memory and homeownership a mass phenomenon. Economic growth in the United States, after a robust 1950s, hit a phenomenal 52.8 percent in the 1960s; more significantly, median family income rose 39.7 percent over the decade. In Japan and West Germany, losers in the Second World War, economic “miracles” led to revolutions in mass consumption. New media technologies, such as cinema and radio, which had seemed so convenient for inter-war dictatorships seeking to spread propaganda, turned out to be conduits of a commercial mass culture impervious to state borders. Finally, all leading capitalist countries embraced the ‘welfare state’ overflowing with inexpensive consumer goods, expanded health and retirement benefits, and increasingly democratic institutions were weapons altogether different from Nazi tanks”*

Nehru and Mao, both committed socialists, had simply bet on the wrong horse to win the race, enamored with glitz of revolutionary ideals in the interwar period, when the future of capitalism seemed the most bleak, they had decided to reshape the future of their country on the barely tested ivory-tower ideology of Marx that had grasped their mind. Nehru, who had converted to socialism sometime in the mid 1920s, had gone as far as saying Lenin was one of “history’s immortals” and the world only had a choice between “some form of communism and some form of fascism”

Both of them had embraced the state-led command economy of the Soviets with regular five or ten year plans, and Mao had gone on to collecticize agriculture as well, banning all private property and expropriating more than 200 million acres of land. Soviet industrialization had really kicked off in 1928 with the first FYP (five-year-plan) under Stalin, and by all metrics, it was a resounding success compared to China or India. After the first two FYPs, heavy industrial output had gone up by more than 300% in almost every sector in the Soviet Union, and the economy grew at roughly 5% every year. The Soviet model was extractive authoritarianism, and the cost of human suffering of labor was ignored by Stalin in the pursuit to rapidly industrialize. The Soviets also had many parts of the puzzle which others did not: they leached of Western technical know-how before the start of the Cold War: Albert Kahn, for example, was an American architect who had designed the Ford assembly line at River Rouge, and helped the Soviets build hundreds of their largest factories like the Stalingrad or Chelyabinsk Tractor Plants; he helped train thousands of Soviet engineers of the *Gostproekstroi* and gave them the technical know-how to build efficient assembly lines. Hugh L. Cooper, another American, helped the Soviets build the Dnieper Hydroelectric Dam, with turbines sourced from General Electric for the same, a pivotal event in the Soviet GOELRO plan to achieve total electrification of the country.

Soviets emphasized scientific and technical education in some fields, becoming pioneers in the Space Race, world leaders in mathematics, chess and most importantly, after the 1960s, they became the *largest petrostate in the world*: 80% of their export earnings coming from selling oil and natural gas. After OPEC cut production in 1973 after the Yom Kippur War to punish Western support of Israel, the astronomical increase in oil and gas prices poured billions into Soviet coffers, helping them maintain their rusted and lethargic industrial production economy, and finance unneccesary wars like the ones they fought in Afghanistan. One of the most important socialist ideas was the importance on self-reliance and independence from foreign trade, which is why agricultural and industrial production was focused on meeting demands of domestic consumption, not on exports, and which is why there was a lot of focus on heavy industry independence by both China and India from the 1950-1960s. However, both China and India failed in this initial push to build their heavy industry, and ended up draining their limited foreign exchange reserves.

Okay

**Mao’s China, Nehru’s India: 1950-1975**

The failure was especially stark in China, characterized by an extreme anti-intellectual atmosphere and rigid party culture that made it impossible to criticize Mao. This can perhaps be best demonstrated by Mao’s desire to double steel production annually from 1958 onwards, going up to 80 million tons by 1962 (up from just 5 million tons in 1957). After the Soviets expressed their skepticism at this target, and dismissed the traditional Chinese approach of smelting steel as inefficient and wrong, Mao doubled down on his target and took the whole thing on his ego. China would go on to encourage peasants to forego agricultural duties to start ‘backyard furnaces’ in their communes to smelt steel; even though these small furnaces could only produce pig iron, the fact that the peasants lacked the technical knowledge needed, and the fact that this was compromising agricultural output. There was also a shortage of raw materials and supply chains necessary in steel production were very limited.

To avoid displeasing Mao, a level of wilful ignorance was adopted by everyone who knew how unrealistic and incorrect his ideas were. Provincial secretaries had been issued orders of halting the ‘misuse’ of all resources that were not directly used to fulfil the steel production goals for the year. In other bouts of madness, Mao launched a campaign to eradicate sparrows, since they ate grain stores, and encouraged all Chinese to take part in this mass extermination. This ended up simply destroying an ecological feedback loop that kept locusts in check, destroying grain stores even more. Needless to say, China never met it’s steel production goals, and it’s grain output tanked so much that the Great Leap Forward saw one of the worst famines in Chinese history, with as many as 45 million perishing after crop yields went down by 30% in just two years. Anti-intellectualism was the norm in Maoist China, with the CCP often adopting quack theories like Lysenkoism, discarded even by the Soviets, and then implementing them brute force on the command of Mao without any research or thought in the policy proposals.

In India, the first FYP was relatively fine, the investment in agriculture (27%) was much higher than in heavy industry (12%) and India had a lot of foreign exchange reserves; Britain released a total of £815 million (US$ 3.2 billion) from 1947-1952 as repayment of the ‘war debt’ to India. Hence, the reliant on exports was not that high, and these Sterling releases were used to balance the budget, fund central and provisional government pensions and import machinery/defence equipment. Despite nearly a 25-30% investment in heavy industry from the second FYP onwards, in FY 1973 almost 50% of all imports (\~US$1 billion) were still of machinery and steel. There was no investment in the textile industry, which only grew 4% from 1952-1964 and India’s share of world exports declined from a peak of 2.5% in 1947 to 0.9% in 1966.

The problem started increasing when India’s foreign exchange reserves dried up after a decade, and exports grew anemically, at a CAGR of 2.4% from 1950-1970. Without a concret export-led model of growth that brought in a current account surplus, there was no way to import consumer goods or machinery and raw materials that was needed to industrialize. The problems here were multifold, firstly, these heavy industries were not globally competitive, and did not produce export-quality products (China’s ‘backyard furnace’ pig iron passed off as ‘steel’), secondly, heavy industry was too capital-intensive and created a misallocation of labor (in plenty supply) and funds (in short supply). Since little money was left to invest elsewhere, there was weak domestic demand for these finished products from downstream industries. For example, the Haldia plant of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFCL) that employed 1500 people did not even produce an ounce of fertilizer for over 20 years while all the employees got paid regularly, living in newly built townships for the plant. Systemic corruption and inefficiencies in PSUs characterized the better part of five decades in India.

Since there was no foreign investment, and no exports, the only way to create money was to print it out of thin air. This led to double digit inflation in starting in the 1960s, all the way till the 1990s. Since the rupee was still a pegged currency then, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the peg and the rupee was devalued in 1966, making imports even more expensive. Around the same time, India had also lost the Sino-Indian War in 1962, and fought another war with Pakistan in 1965, further putting strain on an already faltering economy.

The inflation was passed down to grain prices, though the government tried it’s best to issue price controls and severe droughts in 1965-1966 led to a grain crisis, though nothing as bad as the Great Famine in China. One of the biggest drawbacks of the Nehruvian system was the lack of resources spent in upgrading human capital: health and education. Since the state always had virtually no foreign reserves for the above reasons, there was very little left to invest in education and health.

The complete failure of the Nehruvian socialist state in investing and upgrading India’s human capital can be seen when we compare it to pre-reform (pre-1978) China. The Maoists had better health and education metrics despite the Cultural Revolution disaster. It is hard to put this into perspective: Mao was issuing insane decrees of ‘exterminating all sparrows’ and shutting down the national entrance exam for a decade, and China still managed to have better metrics in health and education than Nehru-Gandhi’s socialism.

If the 1960s was tumultuous for India, it was a nightmare for China. In India, the parliamentary representative mode of government ensured limited upheaval due to the slow-grinding wheels of democracy, but in China whatever lunatic policy Mao had was swiftly enacted without much opposition to it. This uni-party system worked very well if led by an enlightened leader, but was a disaster if led by someone who could not create good policy solutions. The Cultural Revolution remains the biggest blot in the history of the CCP, with the party publicly acknowledging its ‘greatest mistake’ and sentencing the ‘Gang of Four’ deemed responsible to death (later commuted to life sentences). The Sino-Soviet split in 1961 had isolated China from it’s largest trade and technology partner; stripped it of the technical assistance it needed in things like its nuclear weapons program. There was also fear that counter-revolutionary fervor in the country would dilute the core Marxist ideology of the party and led to a bourgeoise takeover, which is what Mao thought was happening in Russia with Nikita Khrushchev denouncing Stalin. It was also a way for Mao to consolidate power again after his failure in the Great Leap Forward. The cultural revolution led to a decade of complete cultural and intellectual rot, a purge of some of the smartest individuals in the country and destruction of the education system. Buddhist and Confucian temples were vandalized, including the cemetery of Confucius himself, missile engineers like Yao Tongban were beaten to death, millions of young urbanites were forced to move to the rural areas and Red Guards massacred suspected ‘counter-revolutionaries’ and their families all across the country. Upto two million people died, and thousands of China’s leading scientists were disgraced or persecuted.

Most universities in the country remained closed from 1966-1972, and a directive from Mao ended the university examination system and replaced it with a recommendation system, in which peasant-workers were recommended to university based on their political views and background, rather than a meritocratic examination system. The goal of university education was to give the technical skills necessary for modernization, and so Mao tolerated it just barely. The university was especially vilified as the home of the ‘bourgeoise intellectual’ and hence anyone with such a background was distrusted. On the other hand, Mao really wanted to give universal access to primary and secondary education to everyone across rhe country, especially to the masses of rural peasantry. This mandate did have some success, before 1966, less than half of Chinese children finished primary school, 15% completed middle school and 3% completed senior middle school. By the end of the revolution, all children finished primary school, ⅔ completed middle school and ⅓ completed senior middle school. The effects on high level university education were pretty disastrous, and the national examination system was not restored until 1977 by the great reformist Deng Xiaoping.

**Post-Mao China, the Rise of Deng Xiaoping**

Deng Xiaoping was the former CCP Secretary General and Vice-Premier who had been branded as a ‘capitalist roader’ and purged twice by Mao and his allies, eventually rehabilitated in an hour of need as a pragmatic reformer. He came back to power after Mao’s death in 1977 and had secured dominance by 1978 to become the defacto supreme leader of China. His economic and political reforms made put China on the track for world dominance by the 1990s, which is when they picked up escape velocity and road the wave of the 1990s-2000s global economic boom to become the world’s second largest economy and the largest producer. In the graphs below, we can see how it takes a period of roughly 12 years from 1978 (Deng’s ascension to power) to 1990 in which China roughly stays on parity with India on paper, while the internal chaos created by decades of Maoist extremes is cleaned up.

拨乱反正 (Boluan Fanzheng) was the phrase from the Chinese classics used to describe this period of reform by Deng himself, literally meaning “to repair chaos, and return to justice”. In multiple speeches in 1978, Deng clarified what he meant by this reform, often quoting Marxist-Lenninist literature and the Chinese classics at the same time, displaying ancestral pride in the old Chinese nation and beseeching his countrymen to admit their shortcomings and learn from the best in the world today. He invokes the concept of the ‘four big modernisations’ (agriculture, industry, defence and science). He says that the Chinese nation should aim to be a 小康社會 (Xiaokang Shehui) or a ‘moderately prosperous middle-class society’ as the CCP uses the term today. However, 小康 means ‘small tranquil’ and is a Confucian description of a prosperous and tranquil society.

Inspiration for reform was sought from Singapore, a small city-state in the Malay peninsula that had become a maritime and financial services hub. Singapore was a Chinese majority city-state ruled by a charismatic and brilliant statesman, Lee Kuan Yew. The PRC saw it as a model to become a rich nation without giving up complete government control. Singapore was a wealthy city-state run by a Chinese majority that had managed to turn a poor multiethnic city into one of the richest countries in the world, all the while still having an authoritarian uniparty state where the government even micromanaged racial demographics in housing neigborhoods to promote ethnic harmony. Between 1990 and 2011, more than 22,000 Chinese officials travelled to Singapore to study public administration and policy governance at Singaporean universities. Lee Kuan Yew made more than 30 visits to China, meeting Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Hu Jintao and even Xi Jinping, multiple generations of Chinese leaders.

Other visits were made to Japan, normalizing political relations and opening trade talks. Hong Kong and Macau (administered by the British then) were chosen as safe initial city-states to allow ‘foreign’ investment from in the neighboring province of Guangdong, which was given three SEZs (Special Economic Zones) in Shenzhen, Shantou and Zhuhai where the CCP could experiment with foreign direct investment and private ownership by ‘foreign’ individuals, who in most cases were ethnic Han that had deep older ties to the Communist Party or the former Imperial Chinese state and thus were much more trustworthy than Europeans or Americans. Within 7 months, the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian were given the authority to attract FDI from ethnic Chinese into the provinces, and start building factories using imported machinery and tools, with local labor, to export manufactured- assembled goods. FDI was necessary at this stage since the party did not have the cash to invest in the SEZs, but could provide the land and the authority to raise funds from foreign investors. At the same time, talks were also started to take Hong Kong and Macau back into China, a process that would be completed in 1997 and 1999 respectively, after Deng had passed away.

Since there was limited money to carry out most of the ambitious investments the pro-reform Chinese business leaders and officials wanted, it had to be allocated properly, based on what was prudent at the time. Chen Yun, one of the ‘Eight Elders’ and one of the most important members of the CCP at this time, summed up the issue they faced.

*We have 900 million people, over 80 percent of whom are farmers. We are very poor. There are still people begging for food. We all want to modernize, but the question is what can we achieve? We need balanced development. In considering basic construction, we must first consider agriculture. We want to produce lots of steel, but we cannot possibly produce 60 million metric tons by 1985. We lack electricity, we lack transport facilities. Supplies of coal and oil are inadequate to meet needs. Some people make fun of cautious people, making it seem as if cautious people believe that the less steel we produce the better. Ridiculous. Yes, we should borrow funds and technology from abroad. But how much can we be sure that we can repay from our People’s Bank? We need to ensure that we will be able to make the repayments. Officials have not done the calculations. Local industries are competing with our big national projects for materials. Five people want to eat when there is only food for three. We have made mistakes in our work; we still lack experience. I can only do my best*

Under Chen Yun’s direction, investment in Chinese heavy industry was shunned so light industry (consumer goods, textiles, electronics) could grow in these SEZ manufacturing clusters that were importing foreign technical know how, cutting all labor and industrial regulations, lowering taxes and rapidly absorbing rural agricultural labour into the factories. Chen and his gang of ‘fiscal hawks’ were crucial in moderating expectations and not overspending a tight budget, since there was the fear if China overextended itself it would take on too much debt it could not pay back in risky investments.

Chen famously saying “How much time have we wasted since the Opium Wars? 100 years? What is 3 more?” Thus, moderated expectations and slow but consistent reform was a key part of China’s growth strategy, completely avoiding the blunders made under Mao. One such incident was halting the construction of the Baoshan Steel Plant in 1981, which would have cost the PRC $2.7 billion in contracts to Japanese companies. After providing apologies to an angry Japanese business community, construction resumed later with aid from Japan’s OECF overseas fund, and the plant was completed in 1985; 30 years later it would become the world’s largest producer of steel. By 2006, the five SEZs accounted for over 22% of China’s exports and 5% of total GDP. All kinds of SEZs combined (including all industrial parks) accounted for 22% of GDP and 60% of exports in 2007, generating more than 30 million jobs and generating ⅓ of the country’s high-tech output. Some of the biggest Chinese companies like Huawei and BYD Automobile were founded in Shenzhen SEZ. American giants like Apple had sourced their assembly to Chinese SEZs entirely by the mid 2010s.

**Agricultural Reforms, Ansei Province, Wan Li**

The next main issue that the reformers tackled was the agriculture sector and it’s gradual de-collectivization so that grain output could go up, the import bill from food grains could go down, and the agrarian surplus could facilitate the transition of excess labor into the manufacturing sector. In China, the agricultural sector was in much worse shape than in India, which had improved yields enough with the Green Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s not to have to worry about starvation and famines. The Chinese had to go back to individual household farming and modernize their agricultural sector using chemical fertilizers, water pumps, and higher yielding variety seeds. Deng again picked the poor mountainous province of Anhei as an experiment to test out individual household farming, so that success here could then be used to convince the old guard of the CCP to ditch the ‘Dazhai’ model of collectivist farming and let all provinces or villages choose their model. Wan Li was the CCP secretary in charge of Anhei province, had created a successful ‘household responsibility’ model in which the farming households were free to sell their crops in the free-market at market prices after they had contributed to state quotas, while still having the option to sell to the government at government prices, all the while the land was owned by the state and leased out to the tenant farmers who were put in charge of production. This was combined with electric power and fertilizer supply doubling in the four years from 1978-1982, and by 1982, 98% of all rural households had ditched the Maoist-era collective farms. Rural peasant income also went up 100% from 1978-1982 and grain production went up to 400 million tons in 1984. In just 4 years, from 1981 to 1985, China went from being the 4th largest importer of cotton to being a cotton exporter, and Chinese farmers began diversifying into cash-crops from just grain.

While stabilizing the agrarian sector, the reformists were also expanding their intellectual base. More than a million Chinese students were sent abroad to study between 1978-2008, and more than a quarter of them returned to China. There was very close co-operation with the World Bank during this period. The paranoia of the CCP made sure that they did not hastily accept any advice which made them liberalize their market control overnight, or lessen the role of the state, for example, the World Bank wanted China to get rid of the dual-price system since they thought it was prone to corruption (a bureaucrat could buy at government prices and sell at market prices) but the Chinese refused to tinker with it, since they wanted to guarantee agricultural incomes to their farmers (who by this time were relying on the quota prices as a form of subsidy, since increased grain production had crashed prices). Regardless, the World Bank became one of the largest lenders to China, giving almost $25 billion by 1993

China was ending it’s isolation with the global financial system and its institutions, and gradually started participating in the World Bank, IAEA (joining in 1984) and IMF. China also co-operated extensively to train it’s bureaucrats in formal methods of Western economics using the World Bank’s contacts, sending it’s top economists to study at Oxford for a year; more than 70 such economists were trained at Oxford between 1985-1995 and later occupied key positions in the Chinese government. Co-operation was most extensive with Japan, which provided China with funding, technology transfers and technical know-how on industrialization via an export-led growth strategy. Okita Saburo had set up a Japanese advisory group for China that till 1992 gave the Chinese government advice on how to build stable institutions, allocate resources based on promoting domestic industry exports, and showed them the inner-workings of MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry).

The Chinese were impressed with how the Japanese state nurtured their key private industries and provided them with the technology and resources to compete globally: Mitsubishi, Honda, Toyota, and Casio. The 1980s were Japan's Golden Decade, and China was learning everything it could from them. The Chinese learned the technical know-how to operate advanced machinery and scale factories from small to mid-size firms to large corporations by working hands-on with people from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Europe, etc.

**Deng’s Blunder**

One of Deng's biggest mistakes was his premature liberalisation of price controls in 1988. As mentioned earlier, even the World Bank noted that the dual-price system was very susceptible to corruption. In his eagerness to stamp out corruption, Deng had decided to move to market prices and a market-led economy. Despite receiving advice against the opposite from officials concerned about a weak supply chain that could not handle inflationary pressures, Deng removed price controls starting with alcohol and tobacco in July, 1988. This proved to be short-lived, for the mass panic and more than 200% price increase shortly thereafter forced Deng to reverse party policy. This was his biggest mistake since 1978 and since he had gone against popular consensus within the party to do it, he paid the price for it by stepping away into a less active role. This encapsulates another trend we see in the CCP, which was generally missing in the nepotistic dynastic rule of the Indian National Congress. When leaders made mistakes, they paid the price for it.

Shortly before this, Premier Hua Guofeng had disagreed with agricultural reform, favoring the collective model, and had eventually been forced out of power by Deng when it was clear that the individual household farming model first run in Ansei had proven way more efficient at raising agricultural productivity. Mao had stepped down from power after the failure of the ‘Great Leap Forward’; all of this was in line with the older Maoist idea of doctrinal self-criticism, and this culture carried on even after Mao, though not always perfectly. The Chinese economy had rough years from 1988 to 1990; growth slowed to 3%, and the retail and consumer price index doubled in 1988 and 1989. However, by 1990, inflation had gone down dramatically, and the economy was recovering again. No doubt that faltering growth and high prices contributed to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which the CCP crushed with an iron-fist, while the failures of Perestroika (Soviet pro-market reforms) and Glasnost (pro social transparency reforms) led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. One thing that constantly characterised the CCP in the 1980s and 1990s was a cautious desire not to dilute state control on society and the economy unless deemed necessary for the nation's benefit. So political reforms paused after 1989, and so did economic reforms. It wasn’t until 1994 that a new scale of fiscal reforms was unleashed, especially targeting the bloat in PSUs (SOE), changing the tax codes for more centralization and finally ending the dual-price system during a period of low inflation so subsequent price increases would be more tolerable. Deng’s successors carried out these reforms — Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao and Jiang Remin;. However, Deng had officially retired, and he was still the de facto leader of China, even if not actively involved in day-to-day affairs.

**Zhu Rongji and the Rise of Chinese Industry**

Zhu Rongji reformed state-owned enterprises (SOEs/PSUs) by treating them like profitable companies, with the worst performers being shut down and the best performers growing. This was the policy of ‘Grasping the big, letting the small go’ (抓大放小). These SOEs were treated as corporates, and the most dominant ones were to become oligopolies in that sector, then compete with other state-owned oligopolies in cut-throat competition. This was formalized by Zhu with the creation of SASAC (State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission) in 2003, which was given the responsibility of managing the mergers, acquisitions and privatization of hundreds of 200 largest SOEs in China. All the firms were given profit targets, run like cutthroat corporations with executives being graded on performance, and used by the government to constantly keep weeding out the losers, with the 200 in 2003 falling to 150 in 2008 to just 97 today, and contributing to almost ¼ of China’s present GDP, with total assets of more than US$100 trillion, and yearly profits of more than $12 trillion. China also controlled the largest ‘upstream’ firms that supplied raw materials and controlled telecommunications with this strategy, so that the state was far more insulated to price shocks due to international supply chains, and hence the impact on the domestic consumer was much less. For example, when price of crude shot up in 2008 right before the GFC to $147/barrel, China ordered SinoPec and PetroChina not to raise the oil price, and they took on losses of $30 billion in just one year. This was, of course, the classic East-Asian developmental strategy followed by Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea before, and China followed it to the dot after the initial reforms of Deng and others cleared up the base for it.

The government funds these SOEs, and given subsidies when necessary (to promote export discipline, to control prices), usually by the Chinese Development Bank (CDB), also setup in 1994 by Rongji. The Chinese ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ is in part funded by state investment banks like these who use these investments as an opportunity to scale domestic firms (giving them the building contracts in China, or SE Asia, Africa etc) and also assist local manufacuters (who supply the machinery and hardware), and build softpower with the countries they do business with. This is similar to the policies pursued by Japan and Korea a few decades earlier (we saw the example with the Baoshan Steel plant itself). In some cases, the Chinese gain access to the asset they constructed if the foreign nation cannot payback the loan it took to build it; for example, the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka taken over by the Chinese in 2017 on a 99-year lease after cash-strapped Sri Lanka failed to pay back the loan on it (the port was built by China as well, with financing coming from China too)

If we can compare this to India, then we see that significant budget deficits combined with multiple wars, need for raw materials to support heavy industry and lack of foreign earnings had made India print so much money that inflation was close to 10% for the better part of two decades from the 1960s-1980s. The reason India was forced to open up it’s economy in 1991 was because it had drained all it’s foreign exchange reserves, was rocked by the loss of the Soviet Union (largest trade partner), the Gulf War had sent oil prices soaring. No one was willing to give India an emergency bailout till it agreed to fix it’s economy. Compare this to the slow, calculated but cautious approach of the Chinese in liaisoning with the World Bank, IMF, Japan and Europe, and in having multiple power centers within the CCP Politburo that could balance out policy, as well as the accountability when big leaders made bad policy choices. China had not only fixed Mao’s mistakes, it fixed any mistakes Deng made, and built upon that legacy with competent people all through the upper echelons of the Politburo, and competent regional administrators like Zhu Rongji being rewarded with power when they performed well in their regions or cities. After Rhongji’s reforms, China was primed to become the largest manufacturer in the world, with it’s combination of human capital, quick absorption of foreign trade norms and manufacturing standards, and good leadership that enacted the reforms without any red-tape. China also benefited from one of the most liberal times in the world to trade (the 1990s-2000s) and took full advantage of it, surpassing the Japanese economy in 2010, and using Beijing 2008 as it’s ‘coming out’ moment.

China had invested tremendously in public infrastructure using the export earnings it was getting from manufacturing, building a complete High Speed Rail network of more than 40,000 km by 2020, with inland waterways of more than 125,000 km (the largest inland water transport network in the world), and quadrupled it’s road network from 2008- 2020 to more than 5 million km today.

<div class="captioned-image-container">

</div>

Even the picture of China as a low-quality manufacturer of textiles or even just electronics (Apple) is today more than a decade outdated — with China leading in shipbuilding, telecommunications, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing. Chinese companies dominate the power production market, leding in solar, wind and thermal turbine manufacturing. In Solar, China produces about 90% of all the solar panels in the world, and has the second largest reserves of Lithium in the world, with 75% of Lithium-Ion battery manufacturing coming from China. Over 40% of all global shipbuilding comes from China, with state companies like China Shipbuilding dominating in production of Suezmax ships (largest possible vessels that can go through the Suez canal, with tonnage of 160,000 DWT). China also dominates the NEV (new energy vehicles) sector, with companies like BYD being multinational automobile giants, and China accounting for 60% of the global EV sales. BYD, a private Chinese company, started out as a battery manufacturer in the 1990s and soon went into making cars, reverse engineering Japanese cars to begin with and soon extending into electric vehicles as early as the 2010s. However, the company faltered by the mid 2010s due to a lack of cash flow, and did not have the money to learn to get good at making electric vehicles, since margins were already so thin in conventional vehicle sales. The Chinese government identified it during the same time. It pumped billions of dollars into it’s EV sector, with BYD receiving more than $4 billion in subsidies in 2023, up from just $200 million two years ago, when it’s yearly profits were just about a little less. BYD was given $500 million in foundational funding between 2010-2015. This year, BYD is on track to export more than half a million EVs to Europe, India, Latin America, and SE Asia. It had a market capitalization of $750 billion, up from $25 billion in 2010. This is classic infant industry approach combined with export discipline, and Chinese companies have succeeded tremendously. Favorable government policy combined with no cost lines of credit or interest free loans, grants are essential for companies to thrive and grow in technological capabilities. The state must only prevent rent-seeking, using government subsidies and funding while not focusing on raising competency.

**Final Takeaways**

As we had said at the beginning of this article, GDP in the modern world is not a function of people. Still, of productivity, market environment and government competence, and despite growing at more than 10% for three decades with controlled inflation and capturing most of the world’s manufacturing, China still has a GDP per capita (US$13,000) just about that of Mexico — the poorest OECD economy. Economic growth and industrialization do not scale with population. There is a reason Singapore can have a per capita GDP of US$50,000 by serving as a financial services hub and tax haven with no indigenous manufacturing. However, China had to slog for 30 years to become a world leader in producing everything and still barely managed to reach Mexico's levels of wealth.

This puts into perspective the challenge faced by India today, which started out reforms in 1991, and grew fast for a few years at the peak of free trade sentiments, and now has to grow in the post-COVID world with rising protectionism and a manufacturing market already taken over by other emerging markets like Vietnam. There are a few takeaways that India can gain from the Chinese experience. The Chinese invested heavily in human capital even during the idiosyncratic ruinations of the Mao era, health and education based metrics were higher even in Maoist China than Indira or Rajiv Gandhi’s India. The CCP had internal self-correcting mechanisms, ensuring that leaders had to take responsibility for these decisions. If they went wrong, they were usually put out of power (Mao, Gang of Four, Deng, Chen Yun, Hu Guaofeng). Leaders enjoyed sufficient power and control over decision-making as long as their decisions kept bringing results. When results failed, so did leadership. This ensured the party was never taken over by a cult of personality dictator that could not deliver results again (like Mao). The Chinese followed the same approach when it came to their state-owned corporations, following an infant industry approach with tight export discipline that created manufacturing giants and culled the worst performers, a situation like the Haldia plant running for 20 years and not producing anything while salaries were paid would be unimaginable in China. The pace of reforms was very gradual; there was no ‘big bang’ and China reacted slowly and cautiously to changes in the global economy to make sure its citizens did not have to suffer tremendously (stepping in price control via state organizations whenever needed). The Chinese state was very cautious in dealing with Western advice, especially in terms of liberalizing their market or giving up state control, and hence avoided the fate of post-Soviet Russia when it opened it’s economy up and privatized all state assets, which were taken over by oligarchs at dirt cheap prices. In contrast, Western consumer goods flooded the domestic market, increasing prices like anything. The Chinese did not hesitate to use military force to crush opposition to the CCP like in Tianamen 1989 and hence also avoided the fate of Soviet Glasnot, where Gorbachev dissolved the Soviet Union after forcing to use military action to quell rebellions. At the same time, China made sure to learn from the best (Singapore, Japan etc.) and actively tried to educate it’s best young talent abroad (Oxford, Cambridge, NUS Singapore) while still having them come back to take up senior positions in the Chinese government.

Not all of these can be followed exactly by any government that rules India due to the different modes of political organization. India is a multi-ethnic nation with many regional power centers, but much can be done. In the next article, we will look in detail at all the policies the Indian government took out from the beginning of Indian reforms, and try to look at the failure of Indian manufacturing compared to the East Asian tigers.
