The title of this post would be familiar to most theologically hip westerners as the infamous statement of the early church father [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) (c. 155 – c. 220CE), ***“Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis?”*** The tension that is transparent in this statement may be a very familiar feeling to the western christian but is almost certainly unknown to us. So some background is required. Here, we will discuss how early christianity dealt with the greco-roman philosophical & intellectual tradition.

Writing in the 2nd century CE in his *Against the Heretics*, a little over a hundred years after the birth of Christ according to the Gospels, Tertullian says:

> *Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis?quid academiae et ecclesiae? quid > haereticiset christianis? Nostra institutio de porticu Solomonis est > qui et ipse tradiderat Dominum in simplicitate cordis esse > quaerendum. Viderint qui Stoicum et Platonicumet dialecticum > christianismum protulerunt. Nobiscuriositate opus non est post > Christum Iesum necinquisitione post euangelium.  
>   
> What then hath Athens in common with Jerusalem ? What hath the Academy > in common with the Church ? What have heretics in common with > Christians ? Our principles are from the "Porch" of Solomon, who > himself handed down that the Lord must be sought in simplicity of > heart. **Away with those who bring forward Stoic or Platonic or > dialectic Christianity. We have no need of speculative inquiry after > we have known Christ Jesus;** nor of search for the Truth after we > have received the Gospel.*

We must pause to think what exactly is being said here. Tertullian is asking what does the tradition of the Hebrews have to do with the Greeks? Why should the Christians use Athenian philosophy at all? They must not he affirms. The truth of the Gospels needs to Platonic or Stoic intellectual boorishness. We must ask ourselves too, what does a Semitic-speaking monotheistic faith descendant from the tradition of the Jews (spiritually and physically) whose holy cities lie in the Levant have to do with a polytheistic and Indo-European Hellenic speaking one? They clearly are very closely related today. But they do not descend from a common ancestor or even share a common Weltanschauung ([the Mosaic distinction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2928707)). So how did this convergence of pagan greek philosophy and monotheistic christian theology come about? And why did it come about? How did the patristic tradition react to this?

The rapid rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire was accompanied by an uneasy silence as an impeding clash with the pagan world was foreseen. The silence gave way to insecurity, because the nascent christian faith was in no form the intellectual equal of the titan that is pagan greek philosophy. If the christians *{the most outspoken polemics of the polytheistic mediterranean horizon and the youngest religion on the bloc}* were dependent on the intellect of pagan philosophers like Plato or Aristotle to justify their own faith, then on what leg could they claim any superiority? They neither had the intellectual tradition nor the hoary antiquity of their tradition, which the Jews possessed to some degree but which the Greeks and Egyptians were undisputed masters of. How would this dilemma be solved? How could philosophy be “sanitized” for the biblical tradition? This problem was not exclusively christian but one inherited from the jews who had been living increasingly hellenized lives in the diaspora. (Why do you think the gospels are written in koine greek?)

Philo of Alexandria (20BCE - 50 CE) was the first Jew to attempt to marry Hellenistic thought with Hebrew theology. He was a Roman citizen, a Hellenized Jew who was more comfortable in Greek than in Hebrew. This attempted marriage would become very popular for the early Christians as they soon found themselves in control of Rome after three centuries of ignominy. The question of the century was: ***Should pagan philosophy be appropriated when it can be, then digested into biblical monotheistic thought or should it be completely discarded?*** Some of the church fathers like Tertullian were against this marriage, some like [John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom) went as far as cultivating a hatred of the pagan philosophers. [In his homily against the greek philosophers](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_Homilies_On_The_Epistle_Of_St_Paul_T/dNRYo_nGzgEC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=So+that+one+should+not+so+much+marvel+at+them+for+their+wisdom,+as+turn+away+from+them+indignant+and+hate+them,+because+through+this+very+thing+they+have+become+fools&pg=PT45&printsec=frontcover), he lists out many reasons as to why they are despicable and says God has cursed them because they rejected him in their intellectual arrogance, they stayed idolators and tried to bring God down to the status of a graven image or idol. The conclusion is clear though. Chrysostom says:

> *So that one should not so much marvel at them (greek philosophers) > for their wisdom, **as turn away from them indignant and hate them**, > because through this very thing (philosophy, argument, debate) they > have become fools. For had they not trusted what they have to > reasonings and syllogisms and sophistries, they would not have > suffered what they did suffer.*

On the other side of this argument were church fathers like [Augustine of Hippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) (c. 354 – c. 430CE), who were very eager to use pagan philosophy to whatever extent they could to try and justify the christian faith. There was however a hurdle to be crossed. The dilemma we spoke of above. This was a time in Greece when much like India, how old something was added worth to how true it was. The past was idealized and man lived with the Gods in the Golden Age. As Hesiod says, we live in the Iron Age – the worst age to be born in. A life of decadence awaits man, the Gods forsake us. In such a cultural horizon, ***how could Christianity be both new and true?*** Christianity had to assert itself in front of the Greek tradition before it even tried to digest their philosophy. They had to earn the legitimacy bestowed to tradition, by hook or crook. The Christians & Jews both put Moses in the witnessbox as their claim to possess authentic tradition. To be accurate, [the Jews did this first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artapanus_of_Alexandria) – claiming Moses to be the [oldest of all the lawgivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus), older than any of Greece or Egypt. The Christians, seeing themselves as inheritors of the Jewish tradition latched on to this claim.   
  
[Justin Martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Martyr), (100 – c. 165CE) the first christian apologist, would state that Plato got his knowledge from Moses who has greater in antiquity than all the greek philosophers. Hence, the Hebrew tradition was once again the springwell of all intellectual thought in pagan writing anyways. In *Ad Graecos*, (9-12) he tries to prove that Moses is older than the entire greek tradition, that Plato got his knowledge from him and then he lists verses that are taken out of context or mistranslated to prove that every great greek philosopher actually believed in only one unbegotten eternal god. He would go as far as to attribute monotheism to the Orphic hymns as well (a well known henotheistic document). He says:

> *And I think it necessary also to consider the times in which your > philosophers lived, that you may see that the time which produced them > for you is very recent, and also short. For thus you will be able > easily to recognise also the antiquity of Moses. **But Plato, though > he accepted, as is likely, the doctrine of Moses and the other > prophets regarding one only God, which he learned while in Egypt.***

Martyr would go on to say that Plato knew about the one true god but feared he would be executed like Socrates if he told his to the Greeks so he concealed his teaching in an esoteric manner. This doctrine becomes a beating-stick that would be used to claim that either all pagan philosophers who lived good lives in accordance with the logos were christians who were hiding their knowledge of the one true unbegotten god for fear of persecution or ***they were “unconscious christians” who had been inspired by the divine logos in their writing without even realizing it.*** This idea could be used by all christian platonists or aristotelians to anachronistically label Plato or Aristotle as “christians” or “monotheists”

In fact, Justin Martyr expresses this belief a bit brashly. He says in Apology:

> *We have been taught that Christ is the first-born of God, and we have > declared above that He is the logos of whom every race of men were > partakers; **and those who lived reasonably are Christians, even > though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates > and Heraclitus, and men like them**; and among the barbarians, > Abraham, and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, and Elias, and many > others*

The same line of argumentation is of course taken up by Eusebius, who systematically goes quotation by quotation of the Bible and the [Timaeus of Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)) to try and show how they are both concordantly reflecting one unbegotten creator god with creation ex nihilo. Eusebius would go on to of course quote Numenius and say:

> *What is Plato but Moses speaking Attic Greek?*

An important thing to note here is that while there were many Hellenists who responded to this christian apologetics (Celsus, Porphyry) they are out of the scope of this post. The stage was now set, the church fathers had developed their arguments as to why it was justifiable to study pagan philosophy at the same time exalting and justifying the position of christianity in the religious potluck of the mediterranean.

Let us summarize their key arguments.

1.  Moses predates all the Greek thinkers. Hellenistic philosophy hence
    owes itself to the biblical tradition.

2.  All the famous Greek philosophers or mystics were monotheists, their
    theology is in line with & is prescient of Christianity

3.  The Greek philosophers were either Christians in hiding or they were
    all “unconscious christians” and their intellect impelled by the
    divine logos. Hence it is suitable to use their works in
    [Christology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology).

The culmination of this entire belief-system cum apologetics is best seen in the works of Augustine of Hippo, whom we mentioned first as an example of someone who loved borrowing from pagan philosophy. Augustine was a smart and self-aware scholar, he hated any anti-intellectual quackery (such as literal readings of Genesis that conflict with the best of pagan science of the time) coming from Christians because he felt that it embarassed their whole religion in front of the pagans who were well-versed in science. He says in his *literal commentary on genesis:*

> *Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, > and the other parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the > stars and even their size and relative positions, about the > predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and > seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and > this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and experience. > **Now it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a > Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture,** > **talking nonsense on these topics, and we should take all means to > prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast > ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. If they find a > Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear > him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they > going to believe our books in matters concerning the resurrection of > the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven,** > **when they think their pages are full of falsehoods on facts which > they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason?** > Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold > trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren, to defend their utterly > foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call on Holy > Scripture, although they understand neither what they say nor the > things about which they make assertion."*

Augustine was utilitarian enough to understand that talking nonsense about scientific matters as a Christian was a sure sort way to discredit the Bible in matters of theology as well. This being the reason why he did not believe in always having literal interpretations.

Now that we understand the self-aware character of Augustine as a sort of pragmatist looking to augment the chances of his own religion as much as possible, we can understand why he was so keen to use Greek philosophy to justify his own theology. - As to why Augustine relied on Plato specifically, this is a separate conversation and not in the scope of this post - suffice to say he felt the idea of the Gods being wholly good for Plato was most easily reconcilable with Christian belief. It might be interesting to note that Augustine did not actually claim Plato was a monotheist; he said that he was a polytheist who believed one god had created the heavens and the earth. (c.f - Demiurge of Timaeus). Naturally, his reading of Timaeus as being compatible with Genesis is far-from accurate as modern secular scholarship on this confirms. Regardless, he says *in The City of God*:

> *Ex quibus sunt valde nobilitati Graeci Plotinus, Iamblichus, > Porphyrius; in utraque autem lingua, id est et Graeca et Latina, > Apuleius Afer extitit Platonicus nobilis. Sed hi omnes et ceteri eius > modi **et ipse Plato diis plurimis esse sacra facienda putaverunt**.  
>   
> The best known of them are Plotinus, Iamblichus and Porphyry, who were > Greeks; moreover, writing in both languages, Greek and Latin, the > African Apuleius gained fame as a Platonist. **But all these and > others of the same persuasion, as well as Plato himself, believed in > polytheistic worship.***

We must now look at what Augustine felt about the usage of Greek philosophy by Christians and why he felt so, with all the above discussed context (keeping in mind the church fathers who hated greek philosophy). He says *in The Christian Doctrine:*

> *Moreover, if those who are called philosophers, and especially the > Platonists, have said aught that is true and in harmony with our > faith, **we are not only not to shrink from it, but to claim it for > our own use from those who have unlawful possession of it.** For, as > the Egyptians had not only the idols and heavy burdens which the > people of Israel hated and fled from, but also vessels and ornaments > of gold and silver, and garments, **which the same people when going > out of Egypt appropriated to themselves, designing them for a better > use, not doing this on their own authority, but by the command of > God,** the Egyptians themselves, in their ignorance, providing them > with things which they themselves, **were not making a good use of; in > the same way all branches of heathen learning have not only false and > superstitious fancies and heavy burdens of unnecessary toil**, which > every one of us, when going out under the leadership of Christ from > the fellowship of the heathen, ought to abhor and avoid; **but they > contain also liberal instruction which is better adapted to the use of > the truth, and some most excellent precepts of morality; and some > truths in regard even to the worship of the One God are found among > them.** **Now these are, so to speak, their gold and silver, which > they did not create themselves, but dug out of the mines of God's > providence which are everywhere scattered abroad**, and are perversely > and unlawfully prostituting to the worship of devils. These, > therefore, the Christian, **when he separates himself in spirit from > the miserable fellowship of these men, ought to take away from them, > and to devote to their proper use in preaching the gospel**. Their > garments, also, -- that is, human institutions such as are adapted to > that intercourse with men which is indispensable in this life, -- we > must take and turn to a Christian use.*

A fairly harsh passage. Here, Augustine says that the intellect and knowledge of the pagans are like nuggets of gold and silver dug out of the mines of God’s providence and just like the Israelis stole the gold & silver of the Egyptians (who were using it for idolatry amongst other means) and put it to better use, so must the Christians appropriate the intellectual knowledge that the heathens have which might be useful to a Christian field of learning or which can be turned to a Christian use.

The Israeli & Egyptian claim refers to the Bible here, where Yahweh asks the Israelites to plunder the Egyptians of their wealth.

***Exodus 3:19-22 (NIV)***

> ***19**But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a > mighty hand compels him. **20**So I will stretch out my hand and > strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among > them. After that, he will let you go.* >
> ***21**“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this > people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. > **22**Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her > house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, **which you > will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the > Egyptians**.”*

Henceforth, Augustine gives a direct imperative to plunder whatever can be used from the pagans (appropriate as he says) and discard the rest, making sure to leave aside their miserable company. The crux of the argument is that the although the pagan philosophers produced intellectual works beyond anyone’s imagination, the works are contaminated with the sin of polytheism and idolatry amongst other forms of non-Christian depravity and hence are “unlawfully” resting in the hands of the pagans. This of course is part of the Augustinian synthesis which the Christian faith has tried to follow meticulously, indeed building upon both Plato and Aristotle. These arguments would be resurrected in the Renaissance with a similar essence but different external coating. That is however not in the scope of this post.

I conclude this post now with the hope the reader has learned insightful things about the interactions of the patristic tradition with greek philosophy. In a follow-up to this post, I will look at another important question (one almost not asked at all): ***What does Pataliputra have to do with Athens? What does Ancient India have to do with Ancient Greece?***
