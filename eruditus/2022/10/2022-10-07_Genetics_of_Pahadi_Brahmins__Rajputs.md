There’s a few interesting UP Brahmin and Rajasthani Rajput samples from the [2016 Mondal et al paper,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27455350/) they’re available on the [Reich dataset](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) as well, but they are very hard to model. This is because they are genetic outliers who were likely mislabelled.

When I checked their position on a PCA, I realized why this was so. These Brahmins and Rajputs are all shifted towards Sino-Tibetans, moreso than even Bengali Brahmins are. So what we have here are a bunch of Brahmins and Rajputs shifted more towards East Asians than even Bengali Brahmins (who have 1-5% EA ancestry).

However, the cluster isn’t homogenous, and some of these samples are far closer to the mainland Indian cluster, yet still significantly Tibetan shifted. So I decided to label these ones separately and model them on the Harvard Admixtools2 software by the geneticist [Robert Maier](https://www.google.com/search?q=robert+maier+genetics&sxsrf=ALiCzsZLHP6_9-H2G6fDAMjoE18_kJ6jhA%3A1665144893440&ei=PRhAY8ymGuGeseMP8aeh0As&oq=robert+maier+&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYBDIECCMQJzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyCwguEIAEEMcBEK8BMgYIABAeEBYyBggAEB4QFjIGCAAQHhAWMgYIABAeEBZKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQC1jnAWD-D2gAcAB4AYAB9AGIAbEGkgEFMC4yLjKYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz).

Notice how they are closer to Tibetans, but a few of them are on the Indian cline.

Here are the models I came up with. Now, do keep something in mind. Riang is the East Asian/Sino-Tibetan proxy, the best one for modern Indians. [Riang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reang) are a modern Tibeto-Burman tribe from the Indian state of Manipur. Irula is a proxy for Onge/AASI ancestry but Irula is not 100% AASI, rather it is only around 47% AASI, so I have accordingly calculated the Onge/AASI from the Irula score and made the piechart with the Onge/AASI figure for both Rajputs and Brahmins.

***Tibetan-mix UP Brahmin (UBR.SG)***

***Russia_MLBA_Sintashta: 24% ± 2.1  
Irula.DG: 18% ± 10.7  
Indus Valley: 44.8% ± 7.8  
Riang.SG: 13.1% ± 3.4***

***Tibetan-mix Rajasthani Rajput (RAJ.SG)***

***Russia_MLBA_Sintashta: 26.7% ± 2.7  
Irula.DG: 17.1% ± 14.2  
Indus Valley: 40.2% ± 10.9  
Riang.SG: 16% ± 4.1***

In my opinion, the fact that these people have such substantial Steppe ancestry rules out them not being Brahmins/Rajputs. However, they consistently have 13-16% Tibetan ancestry, which isn’t a coincidence.

Keep in mind, these are the Brahmin/Rajput samples with the lowest Tibetan like, the main cluster must be 25% Tibetan. I think the likely explanation is these are a bunch of Pahadi/Garhwali Brahmins and Rajputs who were mislabelled as being UP Brahmins/Rajasthani Rajputs, OR they are migrants from those states living in UP/Rajasthan. It is well known that Pahadi Indo-Aryans are mixed with Tibeto-Burmans, just like the Nepalese Indo-Aryans are.

Regardless, this gives us a look into the DNA of Indo-Aryans mixed with Tibetan ancestry.
