A summary of some recent genetic research and some of my own speculations. We now know that the early Corded Ware (\>2600 BCE) were essentially just Yamnaya with R1a. The fringe theory that the CWC spoke were Proto-Uralic speakers has been put to rest. The missing links connecting CWC and Yamnaya are closer to being solved *[with this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi6941)*. After Haak and Damgard et al, the elephant in the room was how did the predominantly R1b-Z2103 Yamnaya transform into the R1a-M417 Corded Ware? And what about the Bell-Beakers with their R1b-P312? Here are the key findings.

- Earliest CWC individuals till date, STD003 (northwestern Bohemia, 3010
  to 2889 calibrated (cal) BCE), VLI076 (central Bohemia, 3018 to 2901
  cal BCE), OBR003 (central Bohemia, 2911 to 2875 cal BCE), and PNL001
  (eastern Bohemia, 2914 to 2879 cal BCE), showing that CW was
  widespread across Bohemia by 2900 BCE.

&nbsp;

- The first genomic data from CW individuals without steppe ancestry,
  thereby elucidating the social processes of interaction between CW and
  pre-CW people. **Observing only females (four of four) among early CW
  individuals without steppe ancestry** (Figs. 2B and 3C) **suggests
  that the process of assimilating pre-CW people into early CW society
  was female-biased.** The CW non-steppe females were carrying
  significantly more HG ancestry than the Bohemian MNeolithic cluster.
    

- **A sharp reduction in Y-chromosomal diversity going from five
  different lineages in early CW (mean age \> 2600 BCE) to a dominant
  (single) lineage in late CW (Fig. 4A). R1a-M417 (xZ645) went from 27%
  of all lineages in early CWC to more than 91% of all lineages in late
  CWC. This was a nonrandom increase in frequency with these males
  having 16% more surviving offspring per generation relative to males
  of other Y-**haplogroups. Population bottleneck is ruled out as change
  in Y-frequency is extreme compared to changes in autosomal frequencies
  within the same males. The Y-lineage in early CWC males was supplanted
  by a nonrandom process.

This suggests a few things. Yamnaya or a Yamnaya-like culture founded the CWC (VL1076 dated to 3018 BCE shows nearly 95% Yamnaya-like ancestry). The founding lineage was likely already higher in R1a (20%~) than standard Yamnaya Samara (from which I know of zero published R1a samples). R1a and R1b were likely carried by different sub-clans with strict patrilocal ancestry & patrilineal descent. There was a conflict or struggle which wiped out the R1b lines (which was by far the most dominant line in Yamnaya proper) and the R1a males with high reproductive fitness & exogamous marriage secured their dominance. Further, the victorious R1a clan must have also taken european neolithic farmer & hunter-gatherer women for wives (as evident by the 4 Corded Ware women with zero steppe ancestry). This may sound gruesome but keep in mind the chance that paternal lineages in a war-like and deeply patriarchal bronze age horizon switched peacefully is far-fetched fantasy that best not belong here. The alternative is R1a clans were more successful at getting mates (due to wealth possibly?) and just eventually outcompeted the R1b clans. To what extent this can be separated from violence between the two, I'm not sure.   
  
David Anthony [has suggested](https://www.academia.edu/44892216/Anthony_2021_Migration_nomads_from_the_east_IEMA_SUNY_Buffalo) that R1a was present in Yamnaya all along but was not an elite lineage (hence not being buried in Kurgans). He seems to hint at some sort of social struggle perhaps to do with the relative inequality faced by the R1a plebians culminating in an "overthrown of the patricians" and supplantation of the lineages.

He says and I quote.

"*Later Corded Ware populations, although derived from Yamnaya ancestry, were largely Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a, which had been present in the steppes during the Eneolithic and could have remained present but been excluded from kurgans through the Yamnaya era, re-emerging as a dominant male lineage in in the Corded Ware population. This shifting of male lineages within a broadly related set of steppe-derived populations could indicate a succession ofrestricted male-defined clans gaining access to political power and to memorialization underprominentburialmoundswhileexcludingothermalesfromsuchpositions. Theregionally suppressed patrilines such as those that inherited the R1a haplotype would in this case havebecomealmostinvisiblearchaeologicallyinthesteppesbecauseoftheirexclusionfrom Yamnaya kurgan graves, but then emerged as migrants in central Europe. Social and politicalcompetition between patrilines could have encouraged migration to new regions. But if burial under a kurgan was restricted in this way, then aDNA is sampling only the dominant elite, notthe whole population*"

A counter to this argument may be that either Yamnaya lacked R1a completely (leading to another implication, discussed below) or they had it but it was a very small lineage that only gained steam during the CWC expansion of R1a lines. Hundreds of Yamnaya samples have been published and not all were in Kurgans but none have R1a. This would work against Anthony's hypothesis.

We now look at the Bell-Beakers.

- Bohemia_earlyBB (\>2400 BCE) and lateBB (\<2400 BCE). Late BB carry
  20% additional middle-eneolithic ancestry. **R1b-L151 is the most
  common Y-lineage among early CW males (6 of 11, 55%) and one branch
  ancestral to R1b-P312 (Fig. 4A), the dominant Y-lineage in BB (5)**.
  Although it is not possible to determine whether the P312 mutation(s)
  occurred in one of the early CW R1b-L151 males from Bohemia, we note
  that most Bohemian BB males are further derived at R1b-L2/S116
  (R1b1a1a2b1), in contrast to BB males from England whom are derived at
  R1b-L21(R1b1a1a2c1), showing that English and Bohemian BB males cannot
  be descendants of one another, but rather diversified in parallel.

The takeaway from this is that while we do not have R1b-P312 sampled in the CWC per se, the ancestral lineage to it is already found in the CWC. **One of the late CWC samples has R1b-Z2103** which pretty much confirms relation with the Yamnaya (among whom this is the dominant Y-lineage).

There is only one open ended question left here, that is where did the CWC come from? Were they actually descendants of the Yamnaya or perhaps close cousins that descend from a related (but presently unsampled) group between the forest & arid steppe?

Coming to the Ferghana Valley now, two interesting individuals from Uzbekistan are spotted in Narasimhan et al 2018. **Both of them (I4255, I4153) are carbon dated to 3050 ybp which puts them at around 1100 BCE**. **Both of them carry R1a but I4255 carries R1a-Z93**. The Z93 clade is by far the most supradominant one in the Indian subcontinent accounting for nearly all R1a lineages there. I4153 has mtDNA U5b2b and I4255 has mtDNA N1a1a1a1, both of which are mtDNA found in the Yamnaya and other WSH populations. What is remarkable is just how close to India these two men were buried. The Ferghana Valley lies right above the Pamir and the Hindu Kush. It is also just next to, in fact a few miles away from Alexandria Eschate (Alexandria the furthest), the furthest Greek settlement in Asia.

I ran these Ferghana Valley samples up on G25 to check their putative admix and here are the results. **Nearly 68% Yamnaya ancestry with a small bit of 2.2% Paniya (AASI-like) ancestry** in I4255. I4153 has negligible Paniya ancestry.

Finally, I'd like to look at the Greeks. We've known for a long time modern Greeks have a substantial Slavic contribution in their DNA but just how much, we don't know. I decided to model modern Greeks as a mix of GRC_Myceanean and Hun_Avar_Szolad (as proxy for Slavs who invaded Greece around the 6th century CE under the leadership of the Pannonian Avars). Here were the results.

Anatolian Greeks and Cypriots were very bad fits, this was expected as they had almost little no genetic influence from the Slavic invasions. **However, the rest of Greece, especially the Peloponnese saw a good chunk of Slavic ancestry rising up to 40% in Macedonian Greeks.**
