In this post, I will discuss some theories on the genetics of the Proto-Aryans or the Ancestral North Indians. Just before we begin, I must explain why I call the ANI the Proto-Aryans and my stance on the issue. I hold to the mainstream scholarly consensus, that is Proto-Indo-Anatolian originated in West Asia or NW Iran, and then split up into Anatolian and PIE. The latter moved to the Pontic Caspian Steppes, and began a long expansion from the end of the 4th millenia BCE onwards. Indo-Iranian came via the Andronovo cultural horizon. I think most evidence currently supports this, but I’m quite willing to change my mind if enough new evidence comes up that says something else (as I have in the past, for example - on the Dravidian character of the Indus Valley). Now, the ANI are the Proto-Indo-Aryans (Proto-Aryan) for short, since that is the language these people likely spoke (the predecessor of the various dialects of Rigvedic Sanskrit). These people likely lived in NW India and parts of Eastern Afghanistan, and were mixed with the Indus Valley, forming a hybrid population which would later create Vedic culture within India.

Having clarified my position, let us begin.  
  
So far we haven't gotten any samples from Ancient India that might plausibly have high enough Steppe ancestry to be identified as a proximal carrier of said ancestry into India. We know that most Iranians get modelled quite well with Turkmenistan_IA, an Iron Age sample from around 900 BCE Turkmenistan that is a mix of BMAC & Andronovo in a 47:53 ratio. Mountain Iranians like Pamiri Tajiks and Yaghnobis (who live quite close to the original homeland of these BMAC:Andronovo mixed pops) have as high as 85-93% TKM_IA ancestry (plus some Xiongnu/East Asian and some Peninsular Indian). This tells us that some Tajiks can essentially be thought of as Proto-Iranians in genetic admixture. What about Proto-Indo-Aryans? Surely, they would've initially mixed with the Harappans in a close to 50:50 ratio just like Steppe Iranics mixed with BMAC?

We do have more than a hundred samples radiocarbon dated to ~1000 BCE from the Swat Protohistoric Graves (SPGT), but most of them cluster with modern day NW Indians and show a reduced 20-25% Steppe ancestry. This tells us nothing of their ancestral population.

Recently, I looked closely at Narasimhan's supplement again. He called this bridge population formed through mixing of 100% Central Steppe MLBA with 100% Indus as "ANI" or Ancestral North Indian.

> *We found that we could jointly model all individuals on the Steppe > Cline as a mixture of two sources, albeit different from the two > sources in the earlier cline. One end is consistent with a point along > the Indus Periphery Cline. The other end is consistent with a mixture of ~41% Central_Steppe_MLBA ancestry and ~59% from a subgroup of the Indus Periphery Cline with relatively high Iranian farmer–related ancestry.*

> *However, the Kalash are confidently estimated to have non-negligible > AHG-related ancestry (4±1%), and thus while it is possible that they > had the same mixture of ancestries as the ANI, it is also possible that the ANI was an unsampled population that existed in the past that was the true source of the Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in the Modern Indian Cline and that had even less AHG-related ancestry*

So, according to Narasimhan et al, the Steppe ancestry in the Steppe cline is maximized at 41% (that's why he says the Kalash are 70% ANI in his 2018 paper). If the Kalash are 70% ANI with 30% Steppe_MLBA ancestry, then the ANI had approximately 40% Steppe_MLBA ancestry. When did this admixture happen approximately?

> *The published estimate of admixture in the Kalash is 110 ± 12 generations (55), suggesting a post-IVC date of formation of the ANI*

110 ± 12 generations gives us a time range of 1466 BCE - 906 BCE for the admixture in the Kalash and hence one estimate of the formation of the ANI. However, what about the 100+ SPGT samples? When did admixture happen in them?

> *Using this approach, we infer that the Steppe Pastoralist-related admixture in SPGT occurred 26 ± 3 generations before the average sampling time of our SPGT individuals (919 BCE, range: 1263 - 808 BCE), corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of 1815 - 1479 BCE*

This would mean Steppe ancestry had definitely entered the Indian subcontinent by 1500 BCE. Narasimhan suggests the dates from the SPGT individuals are more reliable than the hypothetical ANI ones obtained from the Kalash.

> *This is similar to, but more precise than, the dates we obtain for ANI ancestry in Kalash in our study (Table S 5) or reported in earlier work*

Of course, a good confirmation that Steppe ancestry existed in subcontinentals by the 16th century BCE is an outlier individual found in Bustan, Uzbekistan at an otherwise post-BMAC site. This site belongs to the latest period of the [Sappali Culture](http://www.tilla-bulak.de/E_Sapalli.html). Most of the individuals clustered with the main BMAC Gonur site, but there were some outliers. One such outlier was labelled Bustan_BA_o2. Here is the profile of the individual.

> *Bustan_BA_o2 (n=1): This individual has additional ancestry related > to the hunter-gatherers of South Asia. While the radiocarbon date of > this individual places it to 700 years prior to the Swat Proto Historic Grave complex, the genetic ancestry appears to lie along a cline established by these individuals. We assign this individual the Bustan_BA_o2 analysis label.* >
> *• UZ-BST-015, Site 4, Grave 4, 57-27 (I11520): Date of 1613-1509 calBCE (3280±20 BP, PSUAMS-4605). Genetically male.*

Let us run this sample on both a PCA and then do a qpAdm/G25 of him. Sure enough, this man from 16th century BCE Uzbekistan lies in the North-West Indian and Ancient South Asia cluster.

What about his genetic admixture? Does he have Steppe ancestry or IVC ancestry? Can he be modelled without BMAC ancestry? What about haplogroups?

> Y-haplogroup: R2a3a2, mtDNA haplogroup: HV2a2

R2a is autochthonous to the subcontinent, and HV2a can be West Asian/Harappan.

Here are qpAdm results for Bustan_BAo2, models highlighted in green were successful.

The model that gives the highest p-value uses Indus I8726 which has around 90% Iranian farmer like ancestry. For some reason, all Ancient Indian samples and NW pops like Kalash fit best with I8726. Bustan_BA1 is proxy for BMAC, being from the same site. Quite interestingly, we find not a single model with BMAC works. Only two models pass, and all models with BMAC ancestry in leftpops (source) fail.

Steppe + IVC + Andaman ancestry found in Uzbekistan in 1500 BCE! In almost the exact same mix it exists in 2000 years later. Let us check G25 distances.

***An individual with almost the same ancestry as modern North West Indians lived approximately 2500 years ago in Uzbekistan!*** This means this ancestry had been formed for the first time a bit before that.

Two scenarios come up. This individual likely was either a Harappan migrant in a BMAC site who interacted with Andronovo migrants, or he was part of a population that already had received an infusion of Steppe ancestry by 1500 BCE, and he migrated out to Sappali Culture after this Steppe infusion. The second makes more sense to me, for why wouldn’t this individual have BMAC ancestry if he was a migrant who had been living there for a while? And how would he get Steppe ancestry but not BMAC? This somewhat confirms the above dates given in Narasimhan et al that Andronovo ancestry reached the subcontinent in the first half of the 2nd millenium BCE.

Now, the most interesting part is that one outlier exists in the Loebanr Cemetery that has close to the theoretical maximum 42% Central_Steppe_MLBA ancestry. It’s a female sample so we get no Y-DNA but the mtDNA was T1a1a which is from the Steppes. Here’s the grave and sample description.

> *SPGT_o: Swat Protohistoric Grave Type outlier (n=1). This individual is a mild genetic outlier from the SPGT cluster in PCA, and hence we give them a separate analysis label.* >
> *• Grave 140, single burial, 547 (I12138): Context date of 1000-800 > BCE. Genetically female. Single burial with individual resting > (flexed) on the left side. The assemblage includes 20 vessels and > miniature vessels, beads of semi-precious stones, an iron pin and a spindle whorl (see pages 207-208 of ref. (180)). The chronology of the pottery is associated to the middle/late phase of the Swat Protohistoric Graves assemblages.*

Let us first see it’s position on a PCA. On the G25 West Eurasian PCA, Loebanr_o is clustered inbetween the Rors of India and Tajiks of Tajikistan. This makes sense, considering both these groups have Steppe_MLBA ancestry in the 40% range.

On the South Asian PCA, the outlier is slightly more shifted towards Tajiks (perhaps some BMAC ancestry?)

Let us see qpAdm models.

4/6 successful models. Prima facie, I am going to say the passing models without BMAC are less likely, the reason I say this is because Loebanr_o would cluster almost perfectly with Indian Rors or Hindu Jats if it had no BMAC. However, we see it is shifted towards Tajiks on both PCA and G25 distance plots.

Loebanr_o is shifted towards Iranic populations that have BMAC ancestry, and towards Indo-Aryan isolates like Kalash who also definitely have BMAC ancestry.

If it truly was 40% Steppe_MLBA, 55% Indus_West and 5% Andaman, it would be the closest to Indian Rors, who mostly have the exact same mixture. *Therefore, I think Loebanr_O is likely around 40% Steppe_MLBA, 10% BMAC, 43% IVCp_west and 6% Andamanese*. (I think 22% BMAC seems too much, so I’m ruling it out based on a pure hunch, this is not gospel). ***Please always keep in mind that IVCp_west is \*very different\* from IVCp_pool. The former is 80%~ Iranian farmer, while the latter is 60% Iranian farmer.***

I think this is amazing, because it shows us that individuals that were nearly 100% ANI-like existed approximately 6-7 centuries after the initial Steppe admixture into India (based on Narasimhan et al 2019).

At this point, I got a brilliant idea, why not try modelling the elusive Kalash (who are allegedly 70% ANI, 30% ASI) with this almost 100% ANI like population? I have tried a lot models on the Kalash, and most of them failed. Please keep in mind that Narasimhan was not able to model the Kalash successfully either (the 30% Steppe three way model does not pass on qpAdm as he himself notes in the supplementary)

Let’s see if Loebanr_o helps us in some way. I will bore you the details, but since I wrote the last sentence, it has taken dozens of failed models to finally come up with one that passes, and believe me –– Loebanr_o is the only population that has made Kalash pass successfully so far on qpAdm. So our hunch was right, the nearly 100% ANI type woman can be used as a source for 70% ANI Kalash.

After my first few models failed, the gendstats showed Kalash needs more BMAC type + WSHG. I already knew from G25 models that some type of BMAC ancestry (8-10%) will be needed. I tried adding BMAC + Tyumen just to have it fail, then I searched for ancient populations closest to Kalash and found KGZ_Aigryzhal to be very close on G25 distances. If you look up the admix of KGZ_Aigryzhal, it’s basically 70% BMAC + 30% WSHG, or 55% BMAC + 45% Kumsay. I also knew that Indus_Pool is a terrible choice for Kalash but I still tried it, it failed. Any model that had extra BMAC in the form of Gonur1/BustanBA also failed, once again confirming my own G25 models that Kalash don’t have a lot of BMAC. (For these old models, see this post)   
  
After a lot of more failed models, I decided that even Andamanese wasn’t working, so I replaced it with Irula (couldn’t find Paniya in the dataset). I noticed my model almost passed now, (p-value \> 0.05 = pass). Taking a look at the other models qpAdm rejected, I found the second most favored model had a p-value of 0.068 (chi sq = 14.572) but put the Indus_P_max as 0.000. Maybe Kalash simply doesn’t need that much excess Iranian farmer, so I removed it and voila, our model passed.

I have been trying to model the Kalash for a long time, and believe me, this is the only successful model I came up with. My original hunch based on the 100% ANI (Loebanr_o) used to model Kalash (70% ANI) was right.

Here are the models, the first one: https://pastebin.com/hDVHFSTQ

the successful one: https://pastebin.com/kYRRcLN8

Final admixture of the Kalash. For those curious, here is basal ancestry breakdown.

Steppe_MLBA: ~26%  
Iranian Farmer: ~25%  
Andamanese: ~15-20%  
WSHG: ~16%  
BMAC: ~13%

(BTW, just to check, I tried modelling Kalash with the Barikot or Udegram IA samples and found they failed quite miserably). ***The Steppe estimate of 26% is quite close to Narasimhan’s estimate of 27% (while using IVCp_west).***

***However, Narasimhan got a p-value of 0.0000.. while we have managed to get one around 0.0512***. ***Well, there is the mystery of the Kalash solved.*** How and where this Aigryzhal comes from, I don’t know. Maybe it was some type of admixture only pops in Chitral and Swat received? On that note, I wonder if we can model most Punjabis with Loebanr_o too? I have to test it out, and I eventually will. For now, this shall suffice.

To conclude, we found an outlier from 16th century BCE Uzbekistan that is similar to modern North Indians, we found a proximal source for ANI in the form of the Loebanr_o and we modelled the Kalash successfully.
