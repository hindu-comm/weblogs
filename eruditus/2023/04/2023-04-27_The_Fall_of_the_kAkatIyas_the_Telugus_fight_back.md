The Ruins of Warangal, the Kakatiya capital.

We should picture this. It is the second decade of the 14th century and the greatest Hindu Kingdoms of India have fallen like dominoes to the Turks. The Shāhī-s in our own native Gandhara fell the first to the Turkic Ghaznavids, the Cāhamāna-s were next, followed by the Gāhaḍavālas of Kannāuj. In one sweep, and a few decades put together, the campaigns of the Qarluk Turk, Mohammed Ghazni and his dynasty's usurper, the Tājīk Mohammed Ghori, had put an end to 1000 years of Hindu rule from Kabul to Kannāuj. These conquerors were not like the last Central Asians who invaded India; the polytheistic Kuṣāṇ-s who shared with us an Indo-Iranian syncretic pagan milieu; these conquerors were chiefly Turks, once Buddhist Central Asians, they were now the sword of Islam. Fearsome once-nomadic Steppe horselords with the latest siege warfare equipment, artillery and weaponry at their disposal; they were hard to beat. Of course, they were not all Turuṣka-s, some were Tājīk-s (Ghori, and Ghazni was maternally one) and their army was full of Paṭhān tribesmen (chiefly known as Afghan/Avagāṇ). The one thing they shared in common was that they were all recent converts to the Mohammedan faith: some tribes converted from Buddhism, some from Zoroastrianism, some from Turkic Paganism, some from Hinduism and some from a syncretic mix of all of the above. Estranged forever from their polytheistic Indo-Iranian brethren, their new religion was not one that would lead them to assimilate easily into India, as every other polytheist had before.

Down South, in the coasts of the Andhra country and the interior upland of modern Teliṅgāṇa, ruled the Kākatīya-s. Once vassals of the Imperial Kalyāṇī Cālukya-s, these Telugu warrior chiefs had overthrown their overlords and established their own dynasty. This part of the Indian country was unique, in the sense it had not seen foreign rule *ever* (ārya and drāviḍa being the two indigenous peoples of the country), unlike the North, which had been conquered before, albeit never for long.

This was about to change, in fact, it had already changed. The Seuṇa Devāgiri Yādav-s of the Marhatta country had started facing Turuṣka raids from the 1260s onwards. These initial raids were repelled successfully, as boastful inscriptions by local Princes tell us, but in 1296 they faced an unexpected raid by the 10,000 strong cavalry of the Khalaj Prince Garshāsp Malik, the nephew of Sultan Jalāl-ud-dīn Kḥaljī. The Turk prince wanted to seize booty from the rich and untapped Kingdoms of the South, to finance his own ambitions on the throne. The raid was successful, so much so that his uncle, the Sultan forgave him for not informing him about it.

The Kākatīya-s were probably not sitting idle, and there is evidence to show that Pratāparūdra had remodeled his army and the Nayaṅkara system of recruiting to make it more battle ready. The first few Sultanate armies sent in 1303-1304 CE to extract tribute from the Telugus were beaten back decisively at Upparapalli, as numerous inscriptions and the Velugōṭivārī Vaṃśāvalī of local Velama chiefs attest. The Telugu country was a heavily militarized society at that time (and we will see how this militarism will play a role later on) that offered a lot of social mobility to different pastoralist and agrarian Shūdrā peasants who could equip themselves and fight, becoming *Nāyaka-s* or warrior chiefs. These chiefs did not make much pretense of their humble origins, but were rather proud of it, just like the Kākatīya-s claim to be proud Shūdrā-s in almost all of their inscriptions. (some later inscriptions after the fall of the dynasty do call them Kṣatriya-s, but scholars mostly agree with the Shūdrā origins). An example of this social mobility is seen in the fact that by the reign of Pratāparūdra, 45% of the local chiefs pledging allegiance to the Telugu monarch were of non-aristocratic background, while just 12% were hereditary nobility.

The four-faced Brahma, having sprung from the center of Vishnu's navel-lotus, created the celestial beings. Then from his own mouth, arms, thighs and lotus-feet, he produced the Brahman, the King, the Vaishya, and the Sudra, respectively. The Kakatiya dynasty, praised by the entire world and belonging to the fourth varna, then came into existence. In it was born the King named Prola, who was renowned for being exceedingly judicious. (HAS 13.34)

The intense militarism of the Telugu lands can be seen in the martial heroism of their contemporary epics, such as the [Palnad epic cycles](https://www.amazon.in/Epic-Palnadu-Translation-Palnati-Tradition/dp/0198154569), which tell the story of local feuds between competing warrior clans over a succession dispute in the most gruesome and gory manner possible. The hero Baludu is often seen decapitating his enemies, and then cooking their heads in rice, tearing off their flesh and shouting like a maniac as he marches onwards. The Velama histories record how rice cooked with the blood and bones of their enemies was offered to the local Gods, and ankles were filled with effigies of defeated enemies. This martial spirit was celebrated in the Kannada and Telugu lands in the form of [“hero-stones”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_stone) as well, erected to glorify war and the noble death of a warrior. We will come back to the consequences of this militarism near the end of this post, for it helped the Telugu lands bounce back very quickly from their defeats.

After the first few Sultanate armies are beaten, Garshāsp Malik, now Sultan Alaud-Dīn Kḥaljī, sends his eunuch Abyssinian slave, and lover, Malik Kāfūr to subdue the stubborn Telugus in 1309 CE, six years after the first defeat at Upparapalli. It must be kept in mind the *Delhi Sultanate probably had one of the top two or three most formidable armies at the time*, and they had recently defeated the Mongols [battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Amroha) after [battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_India_(1306)), massacring tens of thousands of them, capturing their women, and selling them into slavery. Amīr Khusrau tells us that the captured Mongols were trampled under elephants, their skulls were taken to build towers around the city of Delhi, and their bones were used to fill the nearby fortifications.

*This is what the Kākatīya-s were up against.*

By the way, the 1309 expedition was led by Malik Kāfūr, the hero of the Mongol invasions, who had massacred the army of Kopek Khan. The Abyssinian conquered a local fort at Sarbar, the garrison commander and his trusted soldiers committed suicide, while their wives burnt themselves to avoid falling to the Mohammedans. Refugees from Sarbar flooded in to the Kākatīya capital at Warangal, and Pratāparūdra started preparing to fight back. Malik Kāfūr outmanoeuvred him and laid siege to his capital, forcing him to get inside the inner citadel and last it out. The outer citadel, made of mud and defended by the most loyal Nāyaka chiefs, fell within a month. The fleeing defenders retreated inside the inner fort, (both forts surrounded by mud ditches; the outer fort and its walls made of mud, the inner of stone). Pratāparūdra decided to sue for peace, giving up 23 elephants in tribute. In return, he was asked to bow in the direction of Delhi, showing his status as a tributary vassal of the Sultan and asked to send hefty annual tribute to the court. He was also given a parasol, a chatr, signifying his status as a subordinate ruler to the Sultan in the Indo-Islamic tradition.

It is probably during this expedition that the legendary Koh-i-noor diamond, that today lines the Crown of Elizabeth the Second, was taken as tribute from the Telugus by Malik Kāfur; it was probably mined in the great Golconda mine of Andhra, Kollur.

For 8 years, the Kākatīya-s kept sending exorbitant amounts of gold, horses and elephants as tribute. They even helped Malik Kāfur in his campaign against the Pāṇḍya-s at the behest of Khalji. The Kākatīya armies did a lot of the heavy lifting in these raids and managed to squash some of their own rebellions in Nellore; however, Kāfur could not subdue the Tamiḷ-s and returned back with the rains.

At this point, we must consider that India was not a good place to raise horses, and [native rulers had to import them at a very heavy cost](https://twitter.com/arya_amsha/status/1420773889668386816?s=20) (sometimes most of their disposable wealth) from the shipping routes that led back to Iran; the northern routes had been shut down by the Sultanate, [as they went out of their way to ensure the Hindus could not gain easy access to war-horses](https://twitter.com/arya_amsha/status/1454998137144180740?s=20). *(click the links to see my tweets on this).* Turkish armies at this time consisted of a heavy cavalry core with light cavalry archer flanks, while the Indian armies relied mostly on infantry archers and elephants. The trump card of the Hindus had been elephants, but if the war-horses of the Turks did not panic in front of elephants, then this trump card had absolutely no value left against such a mobile army, and worse, the elephants themselves could panic and turn against their own army, causing a stampede.

It is now 1318. Malik Kāfur and Ala-ud-dīn Kḥaljī are both dead. One of Kḥaljī-s adult sons, Mubārak Shah, ascends the throne (after removing his infant brother). The Deccan has broken out in rebellion under Harapāladeva, who is trying to restore the Seuṇa Dynasty back to power. Taking advantage of all this chaos, Pratāparūdra stops sending tribute. Mubārak Shah sends his favorite slave Kḥusrau Kḥān (with whom the Sultan was in a homosexual relationship with) from their base in Devagiri to have him submit and control the Deccan. The Kākātīya commander, Antil Mehta, is killed in the ensuing fight around the Warangal citadel. Pratāparūdra sees the mighty seige engines, trebuchets, stone missiles and earthen ramps that Kḥān has at his disposal, and realizes it is a lost cause. He agrees to all demands, and Kḥusrau extracts a tribute of 12,000 horses (*per year!*) and 48,00,000 gold coins from him.

As luck (and bad luck) would have it, in 1321 there is a succession dispute and dynastic switch in the Sultanate as Kḥusrau kills his Sultan, only to be killed by the Turkish nobles in anger. There is now a new Turkish dynasty on the throne, the Tugḥluq dynasty. As you might have guessed, Pratāparūdra had stopped sending tribute again, and this time there would be no more chances. Ghīyās-ud-Dīn-Tugḥluq had sent his son Ulugh Kḥān with a large army to annihilate the Kākatīya dynasty once and for all.

The final Siege of Warangal begins, and drags on for six months with ferocious fighting outside the city walls, the Turuṣkas make no progress. The Telugus know that surrender now means complete destruction. The postal system with which the Gḥāzī army would communicate with Delhi had broken down, so no news could be brought to the camp (this had happened before too). It was at this delicate stage that a rumor spread in the Mohammedan camp that the Sultan had been killed by Kḥaljī usurpers. Ulugh Kḥān panicked and started arresting his Kḥaljī sympathetic commanders, the entire army was thrown into disarray. Taking advantage of this chaos, the Hindus storm the Gḥāzī camp and massacre their army, ransacking everything they see and burning the camp. The Turks lift the siege and start running, hotly pursued by the Telugu army that is harassing them. They finally reach Koṭagīri, where a relief army of Majir Abu Riza saves the day.

The Telugus were overjoyed, thinking they have beaten the Turks for good and they will not return. Pratāparūdra declared open festivities, and sold his supplies from the granary for a massive public feast. The garrison at Warrangal was lifted, and the nearby Telugu peasants went back to their farming. Four such unsuspecting months pass, all while the Turks were resting at their base in the Marhaṭṭa country and preparing for another Siege.

Finally, in 1323, the Turks returned to the Telugu country with a massive army of 60,000 mounted cavalry. They swept through the countryside without any resistance and beseiged the ill-prepared capitol. The siege lasted for 5 months again, but the Telugus had run out of food, which they had spent on their public feasting, and there were no supplies to feed the hungry army. The gates of Warangal were broken open and the Turks entered the city. This time there was no negotiation, no tribute demanded, no surrender necessary. What followed was vengeance for the previous defeat, in the classic manner of a conquering Gḥāzī army, the Turks razed Warangal to the ground and destroyed all the public buildings in the city.

Ulug Kḥān ordered his army to smash the Svayaṃbhūśiva temple to the ground, and break its idol, the source of the Hindu rulers power. A giant mosque was built next to the temple. Thousands of Hindus were [put to the death](https://archive.org/details/history-of-the-rise-of-the-mahomedan-power-in-india-vol.-1/History%20Of%20The%20Rise%20Of%20The%20Mahomedan%20Power%20In%20India%2C%20Vol.%201/page/n293/mode/2up?view=theater) by the Turuṣka-s. The city was renamed Sultanpur, coins were minted in the name of the Sultan and a Telugu commander who had convert to Islam, Malik Maqbul, was appointed as governor. Thus, the Kākatīya dynasty was annihilated.

The Ruins of Svayambhushiva Temple in Warangal

The Turks decided not to kill Mahārāja Pratāparūdra and his family, to avoid creating a martyr to rile up the angry Telugu public, and instead decided to send him to Delhi as a political prisoner. Two Gḥāzī-s, Qādīr Kḥān and Kḥwāja Hājī were appointed commanders of the escort. However, the last of the Kākatīya-s would not let himself be paraded around Delhi like a captive Kaffir monkey, his pride and honor would not allow it, for as the escort reached the banks of the Narmada, the traditional boundary of North and South India, Pratāparūdra escaped the sights of his captives, and committed suicide on the banks of the Narmada river, in the tradition of the Hindu epics; death was the only honorable option left. With the death of the last of the Kākatīya sovereigns ended more than two thousand five hundred years of continuous Hindu rule in the Andhra country. He might have ended his line, but he would not be forgotten, his name would be invoked again and again by Telugu warrior chiefs who had already started fighting for their indpenendence soon after.

The Narmada River, where Prataparudra committed suicide

Mohammedan rule was not to last for long in the heavily militarized society of the Telugu country. Prolaya Nāyaka, of the Munsunūri family, would pen down his anger in an inscriptional grant from 1330 CE found in Pitapuram, the East Godaveri district of Andhra. Here goes it:

Although Prataparudra vanquished that suratrana (Sultan) who had an army of 9,000 horses seven times, he had to submit to the Turushka at last owing to the decrease of the good fortunes of the people of the earth when the Sun, viz., Prataparudra set, the world was enveloped in the Turushka darkness. The evil (adharma), which he had up to that time kept under check, flourished under them, as the conditions were very favourable for its growth. The cruel wretches subjected the rich to torture for the sake of their wealth. Many of their victims died of terror at the very sight of their vicious countenances; the Brahmins were compelled to abandon their religious practices; the images of the Gods were overturned and broken; the agrahiiras of the learned confiscated; the cultivators were despoiled of the fruits of their labour, and their families were impoverished and ruined. None dared to lay claim to anything, whether it was a piece of property or one's own life. To those despicable wretches wine was the ordinary drink, beef the staple food and the slaying of the Brahmins the favourite pastime. The land of Telanga, left without a protector, suffered destruction from the Yavanas, like a forest subjecte to devastating wild fire.

Within a decade of Tughluq rule, mass rebellions had broken out in the Telugu country led by different warrior clans; Prolaya Vema Reḍḍi had established an independent and incipient Reḍḍi state in coastal Andhra, while the Munsunūri Nāyakas in 1336 under Kapāya Nāyaka had allied with the Hoysalas under Ballala III to overthrow the Tughluq governor at Sultanpur (Warangal). A joint Hindu army of various Telugu clans, including probably some auxillary support from the nearby tribals, merged with a Hoysala army all under the command of Kapāya Nāyaka and attacked Sultanpur. The Mohammedans were overwhelemed and evacuated the city, the governor fled to the Marhaṭṭa lands in Daulatabad (Devagiri) and the Telugu country had been completely rid of Turuṣka rule within a decade.

Prolaya Vema Reḍḍi would also commemorate his contribution in this Hindu reconquista with an inscription. Here goes,

The Annavarappadu plates of 1385 and 1401, from the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, refer to king Vema of the Reddi family as having been 'praised as the Primeval Boar (Maha-Varaha) by all the learned for his act of lifting up the country that was submerged under the Mleccha ... ocean; the land of the Andhra shone brilliantly, and while this king was lawfully ruling (the earth), there flourished all the shastras and Vedas and hundreds of sacrifices were performed'

Thus, while Pratāparūdra and the Kākatīya-s occupy a tragic place in the story of the Andhra lands, their tragedy was not forgotten, and they were rather taken as the base of a Proto-Nationalist uprising by the local warrior-chiefs, who would go on to free Andhra and establish native ruling dynasties, before the last great Empire of South India; Vijayanagara, would swallow them all up in a rising Hindu tide that formed an iron wall against the Bahmani Sultanate.
