Our religion is very old, the oldest religion that is still practised. ([Mazdayasna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism) is a close-second, followed by [the roots of Rabbinical Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism)). Not only is our religion very old, but it was also fertilized in an oral tradition that looked down upon the written word. If this wasn’t enough, our oral tradition managed to preserve our canonical scripture *better* than any of the people of the book. *The Rigveda is a tape-recording from the late-Bronze Age*. Our religion and that of our cousins, the Parsees, formed the basis for reconstructing the putative [Proto-Indo-European religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_mythology) of our ancestors. This hoary past of an oral-culture that *‘froze in time’* and never lost its continuity (unlike the Hellenes); seamlessly flowing into the 21st century, complicates things a lot. It bring out the best of the inner skeptic of those who want to readily discredit our theological, ritual and doctrinal continuity: secular scholars, Occidental polemics, agnostic atheists. It colors their perception as sometimes they simply cannot believe it. This often lead to attempts to straight away deny that Hinduism is a religion; it is labelled a colonial construct, an amalgamation of dozens of closely related doctrines. Such views have been rebutted quite thoroughly (*[see Andrew J. Nicholson’s work](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/unifying-hinduism/9780231149860)* or that of *[Walter Slaje writing on Hindu-Muslim identity](https://uni-halle.academia.edu/WalterSlaje) in medieval Kashmir*)

However, some views have gone relatively unchallenged till now. One of these is that the Upanishads represent a monumental schism from an orthopraxic and sacrifical priestly-religion of the Samhita and Brahmana. This view was popularized by 19th, early 20th century orientalists like Whitney, Müller, Keith & gained widespread currency. The Upanishads had gained a Renaissance-esque mystique & classical canonical reputation in [German Idealism](https://iep.utm.edu/germidea/#:~:text=German%20idealism%20is%20the%20name,share%20a%20commitment%20to%20idealism.), with Schopenhauer himself saying that the European discovery of the Upanishads is an event of the same level as the rediscovery of Plato in the 15th century. In fact, Schopenhauer would recommend his audience not to spend time on the “priestly-garbage” (*Priesterwirtschaft*) of the Vedic ritual corpus (Samhita, Brahmana).

It was taken for granted that the ingenuous and moralistic doctrine of karma, as well as that of reincarnation, were later innovations. Some Buddhist scholars such as Johannes Bronkhorst have gone as far as [proposing a completely revisionist history](https://brill.com/view/title/13862) of late-Vedic India in which the Shramana movements of ‘un-Aryan’ Magadha influenced the Upanishads first, and not the other way round. This questionable hypothesis says that neither was the dogma of karmic retribution developed by Arya Brahmins, nor was it readily accepted by them.

Unbeknownst to many who may be reading our post, this view has not gone unchallenged. There has been a lot of scholarly literature *(see the Bibliography)* that shows quite convincingly how the doctrine of karma and reincarnation was already a part of the Brahmana corpus. The mention of [how to overcome](https://archive.org/details/jaiminiyabrahmana/page/n97/mode/2up) *[punarmṛtyu (rebirth)](https://archive.org/details/jaiminiyabrahmana/page/n97/mode/2up)* [in the Jaiminiya Brahmana](https://archive.org/details/jaiminiyabrahmana/page/n97/mode/2up) is well-known.

In fact, in many ways, retributive karma represented the natural conclusion of Vedic ritual. It did not spring out of nowhere. In this post, we will look at some of the earliest references to reincarnation in Hinduism; that is, in the Rigveda.

It must be noted that ***I am not suggesting that Hinduism is immutable*** while other religions keep changing.

### `RV 10.16.5 `

> **`अव॑ सृज॒ पुन॑रग्ने पि॒तृभ्यो॒ यस्त॒ आहु॑त॒श्चर॑ति स्व॒धाभिः॑`  
> `आयु॒र्वसा॑न॒ उप॑ वेतु॒ शेषः॒ सं ग॑च्छतां त॒न्वा॑ जातवेदः`**
> > [1](https://eruditus.substack.com/p/reincarnation-in-the-rigveda#footnote-1-48090782)

*O Agni, release him to the forefathers, and again \[down from them\]  
\[he\] who has been offered to you, \[he who\] travels by his own will.
  
Let him, who is wearing life \[as a cloth\], come \[down\] to his offspring.   
Let him unite with his body! O Jatavedas*

### `RV 10.14.8`

> **`सं ग॑च्छस्व पि॒तृभिः॒ सं य॒मेने॑ष्टापू॒र्तेन॑ पर॒मे व्यो॑मन्`  
> `हि॒त्वाया॑व॒द्यं पुन॒रस्त॒मेहि॒ सं ग॑च्छस्व त॒न्वा॑ सु॒वर्चाः॑`**
> > [2](https://eruditus.substack.com/p/reincarnation-in-the-rigveda#footnote-2-48090782)

*Unite with the forefathers, unite with Yama,   
\[unite with\] the merit of sacred rites \[stored up\] in the highest heaven.   
Having left behind imperfection, come home again.   
\[You who is\] full of vigor, unite with your body.*

### `Shatapatha Brahmana 11.2.7.33`

> **`तुलायां ह वा अमुष्मिंलोक आदधति यतरद्यंस्यति तदन्वेष्यति यदि साधु वासाधु वेत्यथ य एवं वेदास्मिन्हैवलोके तुलामारोहत्यत्यमुष्मिंलोके तुलाधानम् मुच्यते साधुकृत्या हैवास्य यचति न पापकृत्या `** >
> [3](https://eruditus.substack.com/p/reincarnation-in-the-rigveda#footnote-3-48090782)

*Let him therefore sit down, touching the right edge of the sacrifical altar; for, indeed, they place him on the balance in that \[other\] world; and whichever of the two will rise, that he will follow, whether it be the good or the evil. And, verily, whosoever knows this, mounts the balance even in this world, and escapes being placed on the balance in that \[other\] world; for his good deed rises, and not his evil deed.*

In this passage, it is clear that the world after death sees a sort of karmic judgement based on the qualia of the deeds performed (good or bad). The good and evil deeds are balanced, weighed out, and if the good outweights the bad; he escapes punishment. Herein, we have nearly arrived at the classical conception of karma. The deeds here could have been the ritual sacrifice (someone who performs ritual sacrifice all throughout his life is judged favorably) or even moral deeds of any type.

[Another passage](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-english/d/doc63448.html) from the Shatapatha Brahmana displays a terrified Bhṛgu who has come into a reverse world where people who had hurt animals in another world are being eaten up limb by limb by those anthropomorphized animals in this reverse world. A clear nod to the idea of karmic retribution.

śeṣas in the RV here means offspring, not remainder of an oblation as Sayana interprets it. Jameison erroneously translates it as ‘remains’ as well. Yaska makes it clear (शेस।इत्य्।अपत्य।नाम ३।२ निरुक्त). The body of the dead is burnt in the cremation fire as a final sacrifice (antyeṣṭi). svadhā refers to the contradictory movement of the dead; moving but not moving, alive but dead. (c.f - 1.164.30; 1.164.38). Coming down to the offspring probably represents the belief in rebirth of ancestors within their own kin-circles. The Lankan scholar Ganath Obeyeskere identify this as the widespread tribal-rebirth belief within kincircles.

iṣṭāpūrta in the instrumental with the verb √saṃgam (left unexpressed) is definitely refering to the idea that the merit of good sacrifical deeds is obtained in the highest heaven. Parama vyoman is the place where the gods are born and where they grow up (1.143.2; 4.50.4; 8.13.2) It exists at the edge of the universe. It didnt exist before creation (10.129.1).

[3](https://eruditus.substack.com/p/reincarnation-in-the-rigveda#footnote-anchor-3-48090782)

following Eggeling’s translation here. That {other} world is a translation of amuṣmin (locative singular of adas); adas refers to a known & distant place, not as distant as when tad is used. Technically, विप्रकृष्ट but not परोक्ष (out of sight, not visible).
