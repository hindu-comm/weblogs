The asidhārā-vrata literally translates to the "swordblade-vow" and for good reason. It represents a chastity custom of the ancient Arya in which the man taking the observance tempts himself sexually with his wife but abstains from either coitus or orgasm during coitus. It finds a detailed mention in the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhita and those interested can look it up. Therefore, it is verisimilar to walking on the edge of a sword. It forms a noted part of tantric coital ritual and this has been well-acknowledged by firaṅga indologists who specialize in tantra like Alexis Sanderson. It’s purpose can said to be cultivation of self-discipline via sensory restraint and transforming that into a spiritual gnosis (siddhi). P.V Kane hints that this practice was orignally a Brāhmaṇical ascetic vow with little room for coitus actually taking place. He says and I quote:

> *One has to sleep on bare ground, to bathe outside the house, eat food > only in the night, to remain celibate even though sleeping in the > wife’s embrace, curb anger and be devoted to japa and homa to Hari. > Different rewards according to length of time, the greatest being that > after twelve years of this vrata the observer may secure the rulership > of the world and on death become one with Janārdana. VDR III.218.1–25 > quoted by Hemādri, Vrata section, II.825–7. The wordmeans the vrata is > as sharp or difficult as treading on the edge of a sword.*

This condition of sleeping next to the wife while maintaining chastity might be seen as the less extreme version of what Gandhi did millenia later (sleeping naked next to women to practice self-restraint).   
  
Where things get interesting is that in the Raghuvaṃśa of Kālidāsa (13.67) there is a mention of this vrata upon which Dinakara, the bhāṣyakāra of the great poet’s work writes:  
  
*एकस्याम् एव शय्यायां मध्ये  
खड्गं निधाय स्त्रीपुंसौ यत्र ब्रह्मचर्येण शयाते तद् असिधाराव्रतम्।*

*“When a man and woman sleep on one cot and practice chastity by placing a sword in the middle of the bed – that {observance} is known as the swordblade-vow”*

It seems as if Dinakara has preserved an ancestral memory of the chastity vrata in which an actual sword was placed in the middle of the bed of man & wife to ensure chastity (or prevent adultery or incest?).

It is this version of the vrata that seems to have a lot of cognates in Indo-European heroic poetry. First, we have the Norse tale of Sigurd maintaining ***three nights of chastity*** after his marriage to Brynhild in the Volsung Saga by placing the sword Gram between them on their marital bed. Upon being asked why he does this, Sigurd says the following:

> *He said, “You have done many great deeds, but now remember your oath > that you would marry the man who rode over this flame.”  
>   
> She knew that this was a true reply, and she realized the importance > of what he had said. She stood up and greeted him well, and he stayed > there for three nights, sharing one bed with her, though he took the > sword Gram and drew it from its sheath and placed it between them. She > asked why he did this, and he answered that it had been foretold that > this was how he would be married to his wife, or else he would die.*

So Sigurd says that the three nights of chastity upheld by a sword in their bed is something he had been told to do, or else he would die. The cognate in the Volsung Saga is closely followed by the story of King Gorm the Old in the 12th century chronicle Gesta Danorum (“Deeds of the Danes”) of the christian monk Saxo Grammaticus. Gorm married the daughter of the Anglo-Saxon King Ethelred, Thyra by name. Thyra insists on ***three days of chastity*** before the marriage is consummated which Gorm honors but by placing a naked sword between the two on their marital bed. The entire exchange is narrated by Saxo as following:  
  
*Eoque pacto intercedente Gormoni desponsa nocte, qua prima genialem\* thorum conscendit, sponsum perscuerantissimis precibus aggressa in triduum se uirilis\* concubitus expertem dimitti petiuit, non ante rebus Veneriis indulgere constituens, quam matrimonium creandis liberis efficax futurum aliquo per quietem presagio didicisset.  
  
*Saxo says that some people say Thyra made the three day request only to gain enough time to convert Gorm to Christianity & hence not get spoilt by a pagan in the bed. Here, it’s important to keep in mind Saxo was a devout Christian writing in a Christianized Scandinavia. The original purpose of these ritual vows or observances would have been long lost and what we see is ad-hoc rationalization. This can also be noticed in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, which make Wodēn (Óðinn) the very human begetter of the line of the Anglo-Saxon rulers. What we are met with here is euhemerism used by the Christians to explain why Wodēn was worshipped as a God some time ago by their ignorant ancestors.   
  
Coming back to King Grom. Gorm honors Thyra’s desire but divides the martial chamber into two with a naked sword, as narrated:  
  
*Ceterum ne inconcessum uirginis amorem libidinoso complexu preripere uideretur, uicina latera non solum alterius complexibus exuit, sed etiam destricto mucrone secreuit atque ex cubiculari lecto suum ac sponse diuiduum\* contubernium reddidit.*

We have now established credible cognates in the Germanic pantha of our ancestral religion and must look at a surprising candidate for more cognates; the ancestral tradition in the Caucasus. The Nart Sagas of the Ossetians (modern descendants of the Scytho-Sarmatian Alans \> Aryans) preserve a story in which Akhsartag’s bride mistakes his twin for him putting her in a vulnerable situation. Akhsar, his brother, does not take advantage of his brother’s wife and instead places a sword between them while sleeping at night to avoid intimate contact.

In nearby Armenia, a story with a similar motif has been handed down to us in their folk epic: Daredevils of Sassoun. There are however some flips here, it is Kohar Khanum, the woman, who initiates and she gives a challenge to the man, Mher of David {who wants to marry her} by placing a sword between them and ordering him to put an end to unfair taxation of the Armenians by the King of the West, upon which she will marry him. There is no mention of marital chastity or the three-day-period here.   
  
The story goes as follows:  
  
*For seven days and seven nights They held a wedding feast,   
Ate, drank, and made merry.   
  
Mher went to Kohar's bed at night; She laid a sword between Mher and herself. —The King of the West is collecting A tax from us, she said; If you can put an end to that, I will be your wife, you will be my husband.

![Accolade - Wikipedia](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4469933-07c8-4461-bf74-f3f54d7af177_1200x2061.jpeg "Accolade - Wikipedia")

As a side note – Kohar Khanum is portrayed as quite the valiant maiden who actually disguises herself as her brother to duel her prospective husband to judge whether his swordsmanship is up to the mark to marry her or not. Perhaps a bit in the mould of the Amazonian warriors of nearby Scytho-Sarmatia.

Another interesting point is the preservance of the sword-motif in the oldest christian country in the world: The Kingdom of Armenia.   
  
Now, we must draw our attention back to the “three-nights” which I had boldened up. There is a significance to that which the Apāstamba Gṛhya Sūtra of our tradition seems to preserve. It seems that after marriage; man and wife observed a chastity vow of ***three-nights*** in which they both slept on the ground with a perfumed staff interposed between them.

> ApGrS (3.8.8-9)  
> *  
> 8. \[From that day\] through three nights they should both sleep on > the ground, they should refrain from having sex, and should avoid salt > and pungent food.  
>   
> 9. Between their sleeping-places a staff is interposed, which is > anointed with perfumes and wrapped round with a garment or a thread.  
>   
> *

This seems to confirm our suspicion that in some archaic versions of the sword-vow, a substitute such as a staff or a stone might have been used but serving the similar function of dividing the space where a man and his wife sleep. A possibility exists due to the difficulty in producing swords in the EMBA, the original vow used a staff but was substituted in most cultures (via convergent evolution) with the sword. However, this seems a bit unlikely to me. With this we can conclude that the Indo-European people had a martial vow between husband & wife or a suitor & his mistress that involved some sort of sexual abstension or chastity and the placement of a sword to divide the marital chamber into two. The vow must have carried a lot of venerance & honor; This is because of its persistent usage in cultures that had been Christianized thoroughly for a long time.
