The past few years have been somewhat of a revolution in South Asian archaeogenetics with the two massive papers published by Vagheesh Narasimhan that took a look at hundreds of South-Central Asian genomes from the Bronze-Age all the way to the Historic Period.

***[The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat7487) ***went on to become themost downloadedgenetics/genomics paper in the history of the bioRxiv pre-print server. The story as we got from that paper was this: South Asians and Europeans share a similar demographic history. Both landmasses were first populated by hunter-gatherers for tens of thousands of years, before migrating Neolithic farmers from Iran and Anatolia respectively brought agriculture to both places, mixing with the local hunter-gatherers and creating civilizations such as the Harappan, Minoan or Etruscan.

In the case of South Asia, there is a possibility that to some extent, agriculture in part developed indigenously (rice, barley) while part came from Mesopotamia/Iran (wheat). This is also perhaps backed up by the fact that the [Iranian-farmer like ancestry in India diverged from Mesolithic Iranian Hunter Gatherers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419309675) tens of thousands of years ago.

Then, finally, come expansions of Indo-European speaking mobile Steppe pastoralists who had domesticated the horse, built wagons for ease of mobility, and practiced a way of life quite different from the neighboring sedentary farmers and foragers. I will skip the subsequent genomic history of Europe, for this is not a post on that.   
  
When it comes to India, the picture is relatively clear now, though still a bit hazy. We know that middle-late Bronze Age Andronovo semi-agriculturalist (they did not exclusively rely on their herds) tribes entered the subcontinent in the first half of the 2nd millenium BCE (2000-1500 BCE). These would mix with the local Harappans and form the population stock with *which modern Indians have about 3500 years of genetic continuity*. Narasimhan’s paper looked at a large number of Indian populations, but not at all of them. There was another [paper an year ago by AJ Pathak](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929718303987) that specifically looked at North West Indian tribes, the ones who inhabit the regions where the Indus Valley used to be. In this note, I will analyze the ancestry profile of a few such populations with open-access data of these genomes taken from the European Nucleotide Archive.  
  
A few comments on the methods and sources used. For the Corded-Ware derived Western_Steppe_MLBA source, I have used Srubnaya_Alakul instead of Sinashta. Srubnaya (literally meaning timber-grave) was another Fatyanovo \> Abashevo derived Indo-Iranian speaking Steppe culture, just like Sintashta-Petrovka. It was located more Westward, in the zone of the original Pontic Caspian Steppes and spread between north of the Black Sea and the Caspian.   
  
Srubnaya_Alakul is prefered as a source over Sintashta, Kangju, Turkmenistan_IA and Andronovo on all qpDstat runs. These qpDstat runs work as follows, (description from the Harvard files)

  
For any 4 populations (W, X, Y, Z), qpDstat computes the D-statistics as -The output of qpDstat is informative about the direction of gene flow. So for 4 populations (W, X, Y, Z) as follows -

***If the Z-score is +ve, then the gene flow occured either between W and Y or X and Z***.

***If the Z-score is -ve, then the gene flow occured either between W and Z or X and Y.***

If I put a completely distant and unrelated population such as Chimpanzee or Mbuti African Foragers in W, then whatever Z-score we get, it will be certain that mixing cannot have happened between W & Y or W & Z. This leaves only the other option left.  
  
Let us see an example.

    1 Mbuti.DG Jat_Pathak Russia_Srubnaya_Alakul.SG Russia_MLBA_Sintash… -0.00155 0.00197 -0.787 0.431 

In this run, the Z-score is -0.715 which means that either Jat_Pathak mixed with Srubnaya_Alakul or Mbuti African Foragers mixed with Sintashta_MLBA. We know the latter scenario is impossible, so that leaves the former. This means Srubnaya_Alakul is weakly prefered as a Steppe source over Sintashta. (Z-score of +- 2 and above is significant usually

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7958da74-6fff-4a1b-992d-afc0ba153ec0_1438x356.png)

    1 Mbuti.DG Ror   Russia_Srubnaya_Alakul.SG Russia_MLBA_Sintashta -0.00137 0.00126 -1.09 0.275 

Similarly, Ror get a slightly negative score showing preference of Srubnaya_Alakul.

    1 Mbuti.DG Punjabi_Khatri Russia_Srubnaya_Alakul.SG Russia_MLBA_Si… -0.00429 0.00158 -2.71 0.00668 

For Punjabi Khatris, the Z-score is quite significant indicating very strong preference of Srubnaya_Alakul over Sintashta. Same thing for Punjabi Jatt Sikhs but less strongly so. One of the reasons Srubnaya Alakul may be prefered is because it has slightly higher WSHG/Siberian ancestry (about 2%) which is exactly what Indians need as part of the Steppe source.

    1 Mbuti.DG Punjabi_Jatt Russia_Srubnaya_Alakul.SG Russia_MLBA_Sintas… -0.00258 0.00158 -1.63 0.103 

For Brahmin populations, in all except 2, the prefered Steppe source is Srubnaya_Alakul and not Sintashta. Kashmiri Pandit and Kannada Brahmin show a completely non-statistically signifcant weak preference for Sintashta (Z is not over 2).

Srubnaya Alakul is once again prefered over TKM_IA and very significantly so over Kangju for all North Westerners except Khatris who do have some legitimate BMAC/Oxus ancestry. (Look at the z column)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a8a356-3386-405f-a4ae-417238c0212e_1210x330.png)

Srubnaya Alakul prefered over Kazakasthan_Kangju.

I won’t post the runs, but it’s the same story for all the Brahmins. While I was checking the Srubnaya samples on yfull to find what their paternal lineage was, I saw that*** Srubnaya has a lot of diversity in R-Z93 subclades (Z2124, lot of basal Z93, [Z280](https://www.yfull.com/tree/R-Z280/) \[KZB008;the European clade of R1a-M417\], Z2122)*** while ***Sintashta is mostly Z93 \> Z2124.*** For a population that was allegedly the Proto-Indo-Iranian speaking culture, shouldn’t there have been R-Z93 subclades representing all the different future Iranic and Indic tribes? As for Srubnaya being entirely Iranian speaking or giving rise to the Scythians, [the mtDNA doesn’t seem to line up exactly](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat4457).

Late Bronze Age (LBA) Srubnaya-Alakulskaya individuals carried mtDNA haplogroups associated with Europeans or West Eurasians (*[17](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat4457#core-R17)*) including H, J1, K1, T2, U2, U4, and U5 (table S3). In contrast, the Iron Age nomads (Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians) additionally carried mtDNA haplogroups associated with Central Asia and the Far East (A, C, D, and M) (table S3) (*[11](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat4457#core-R11)*, *[18](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat4457#core-R18)*). The absence of East Asian mitochondrial lineages in the more eastern and older Srubnaya-Alakulskaya population suggests that the appearance of East Asian haplogroups in the steppe populations might be associated with the Iron Age nomads, starting with the Cimmerians.

This supports the fact that the original Scythians came straight from Mongolia, and hence carried maternal lineages from Khovsgol_BA type Altaic populations, and these lineages spread in the latter Iron-Age Iranic nomads as these Eastern Scythians swept the Steppe, taking the Scythian package with them. See my blog for more ([The Scythians were half Asian](https://vritrahan.blogspot.com/2022/09/the-scythians-were-half-asian.html)). The language spoken by the Srubnaya is not certain at all because we have absolutely no written evidence from any texts they left behind and neither do we have some Herodotus of the Bronze Age telling us fabulous tales about these timber house dwelling semi-agriculturalist stockbreeders. They are only considered to be Iranian speaking based on modern hydronyms and toponyms that might be relics of later expansions of Iranic speaking Iron Age horse riding nomads.   
  
The Srubnaya culture arose as a mix of the Potapovka (whom David Anthony even calls Proto-Srubna) and Abashevo-type Steppe zone, the latter also being the source of the Sintashta culture and likely it’s war-chariot too.

Here below we have an example of an Indian man from Madhya Pradesh who has a very basal upstream [R-Z93 clade (R-Y91310)](https://www.yfull.com/tree/R-Y91310/) and he sits right next to a man from the Srubnaya-Alakulskaya ** population at the Kazburun I Barrow Burial grounds in the Western Urals.

We find another [very basal R-Z93 clade](https://www.yfull.com/tree/R-YP1506/) in the Srubnaya (I0232) and in a Lahori Punjab (HG03705).

Let us move on to simply modeling our populations now. Here are the final results.  
(For those curious, [here are the qpAdm runs](https://pastebin.com/4BvcZYcS) of those files.)

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5e7b857-a34b-4c7d-ab54-5d29725db45c_1444x920.png)

1.  Indus Valley here is the following sample IDs: I12123, I10409,
    I11041 (these are the Harappan like genomes from the Oxus cemetery
    at Gonur). North Western populations do not give passing 3-way
    models with Indus Shahr-I-Sokhta-BA2 indicating the IVC ancestry of
    NW Indians is similar to Gonur_BA2 rather than SiS_BA2.

2.  Kamboj label here excludes 3 samples which are outliers: KJ38, KJ34,
    KJ26

3.  Khatris and Kamboj definitely need some
    [Oxus/BMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana_Archaeological_Complex)
    ancestry, but the rest of the populations work fine without it.

4.  Central_Steppe_EMBA is Kumsay_EBA. This ancestry is a unique mix of
    Siberian Hunter Gatherers (Holocene descendants of Ancient North
    Eurasians) and Chalcolithic migrants from the Western Steppe
    (Progress, Vonyuchka). This ancestry was probably picked up by the
    Andronovo during their time in Central Asia which is where some
    extra Q1a, Q1b entered the Indo-Iranian genome (found in Swat
    samples). Though do keep in mind Y-DNA Q was found in the Yamnaya
    forebearers of the Sintashta as well, so it’s hard to separate the
    two.

This will do it for now, and I feel is a satisfactory enough look at the situation. We now know have good ancestry models for NW Indians and have come to the conclusion that Srubnaya-Alakul serves as one of the best sources for Steppe MLBA ancestry in Indians.

*Bonus: FST genetic distance of Indian populations to Srubnaya_Alakul*

The whiter the shade, the closer the pop is to Srubnaya_Alakul. You can see how far Muslims from Uttar Pradesh and Dravidian tribals are.
