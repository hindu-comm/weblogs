The Back Office of the World: Indian IT, Manufacturing and Reforms

Over the course of one generation — from 1990 to 2020, the world saw China transform itself from a backwater filled with rice farmers, plagued by the depravities of Maoism and the burden of conformist Confucian tradition into the world’s largest and most dynamic factory. The Han transformed quaint fishing villages in Guangzhou into bustling megapolises with beams of steel that pierced the heavens. In our last article, we looked at the structural and economic reforms needed to bring about this transformation in China, and briefly glanced over India’s failure to bring about a similar transformation in the 1990s and 2000s. In this article, we will look at the policy reasons for this failure, the failed attempts to reform in the 1980s leading to financial crisis and the aborted efforts to liberalize in the 1990s, which lead to an era of rapid but unsustainable growth. India’s dominant IT services export industry led to it being known as the world’s backoffice, but China was the world’s factory, and outsourced customer service simply does not pay as much as building cars, ships, planes and power plants. The structural road-blocks in rapid sustainable development in India (infrastructure, education, research, land/labor reforms) only began to be fixed in the last decade after the rise of the Modi government but even then a lot of the solutions are stymied by the nature of India’s political electorate.

**The 1980s reforms, debt-driven growth and seeds of crisis**

The first wave of economic change in India began in the 1980s, after Indira Gandhi came back to power and the Janta Party coalition collapsed. The 1970s had seen the rise of stagflation in the Western world due to the oil shocks of 1973, 1979 and 1980. Political instability and crisis in the Middle East, with the Yom-Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution had cut oil supply and sent costs soaring across the world. 1979 was one of the worst years for the Indian economy, with nearly \~20% inflation and negative 6% YoY growth. In fact, 1965-1979 was the worst period for the Indian economy with nearly double digit inflation on average and sub 3% GDP growth. Crude oil import had gone from a mere 11% of the import bill in 1972 to almost 30% by 1975 and before the situation could stabilize, the second oil shock of 1979-1980 sent oil imports to nearly \~50% of India’s import bill. Exports as a percentage of GDP stagnated at 4-5% despite the rupee devaluation in 1966 and India was fast running out of foreign currency to finance it’s government. To stabilize this situation that she inherited in 1980, Gandhi seeked a crucial US$5.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1981, betting on the neo-liberal climate being in her favor, since this was the age of neo-liberal reform, with western leaders like Reagan and Thatcher triumphing on a pro-business and anti-regulatory free market agenda.

This is something not a lot of people know but by mid-1981, Indian foreign exchange reserves had fallen to cover just 3.5 months of imports, and IMF India Executive Director, Dr M Narasimhan, urged Indira Gandhi to go to the IMF. The United States was in split-minds over going India this loan (in 1966, the IMF had given India it’s first loan, and it was this loan which had even forced the Indians to devalue the rupee on instructions) but Narasimhan met with the Treasury Secretary who told him the US would not veto the loan if it came to the board, but they opposed this from a fiscal perspective. The US State Department was in favor of it, and De Larosiere, IMF Executive Director was also sympathetic to India here. India had already received additional assistance from the World Bank before this in the late 1960s, and the World Bank was also in favor of India being given the loan. Thus, it was to secure this funding that any reforms in India even began, this is a trend that the readers must already see repeated in 1990-1991, when the IMF refused to assist India anymore until comprehensive reforms in addition to collateral (gold) was given. In India, economic policy change in the 80s and 90s was not being driven from within unlike in China, but it was the desperate act of a sinking ship to try to stay afloat. Her Industrial Policy Statement (1980) relaxed licensing requirements for 34 industries, allowing firms to exceed production limits and retain surplus output for exports. Operation Forward (1982) cautiously opened sectors like electronics and telecommunications to foreign technology and capital while retaining state control over "core" industries. Small-scale industries saw asset limits doubled (₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh) to boost entrepreneurship. Fiscal measures included introducing the Modified Value-Added Tax (MODVAT) in 1986 to streamline indirect taxes and reduce cascading effects. The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980–85) prioritized growth (5.2% target) through public sector efficiency and private sector stimulation, funded heavily by external borrowing.

However, the biggest issue with all these smaller reforms was that there was still no push in fixing the long-term structural issues plaguing the country nor was a base for some export-led industrial growth laid out in these crucial years, the picture of China having started it’s reforms in 1979 and India in 1991 is only half correct: India and China started ‘reforming’ around the same time, but India wasted a decade and later governments (Rajiv Gandhi) halted any reforms after a plethora of domestic scandals rocked them. The second biggest issue was that from 1980-1990, India racked up foreign debt to finance it’s budget like a drug addict desperate for his next shot. Nehruvian self-reliance had been disastrous in many fields but the self-reliance principle had made India generally shun foreign markets and keep operating a failed state. Nehru also benefited from British foreign aid that dried up around the late 1960s and hence the foreign reserves could not be bolstered by it. The impetus to reform, and the first external aid/loan payments helped India stabilize itself and raise growth up to 5% but foreign debt more than *doubled in just five years* from 1980 to 1985.

After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, a massive wave of sympathy for her across the country led to the Indian National Congress sweeping the 1984 elections with \~47% vote share and 414 seats out of 573 in parliament. It was, and remains, the biggest political victory handed out any political party in independent India. Her younger son, Rajiv Gandhi, had always tried to shy away from the political spotlight, but the death of Sanjay Gandhi, who had practically run the government during the Emergency (1975-1977) from the “Prime Minister’s House” (PMH, pun on PMO), had made Indira rely even more on her own family, and so she had pushed Rajiv Gandhi into politics. A youthful face, with a foreign wife, western education, the 40 year old gaven an address to the US Congress on Capitol Hill that got a standing ovation.

*I am young and I too have a dream. I dream of an India - strong, independent, self-reliant, and in the front ranks of the nations of the world in the service of mankind.*

Unfortunately, this brief hope of glimmer was not to last for long. Rajiv Gandhi started out as a technocrat friendly leader, seen as a major reformist with technocrats like Sam Pitroda and liberal economists like Montek Singh Ahluwalia by his side. Ramnath Goenka, of the Indian Express would would go from one of Rajiv’s biggest supporters in 1984 to his biggest foe five years later, echoing a betrayal of the sentiment that a small section of educated Indians and businessmen had felt come from Rajiv, a betrayal of his reformist roots to return back to socialism for maintaining political capital.

Rajiv Gandhi began by launching the 1984 New Computer Policy to indigenize the electronics sector and focus on creating IT hardware. Import tariffs on hardware/software were cut from \~140% to \~60% and this is the era when companies like Wipro switched to the electronics and computer industry from making vegetable oils and familiar household Indian names like Infosys came about. Gandhi also established the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT) and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). In addition to these small but appreciable changes in the IT Sector, Gandhi carried out a lot of industrial deregulation. The Open General License (OGL) was expanded 1170 capital good items by 1988 from a mere 76 in 1977. Items on the OGL list like sewing machines or chocolate bars received tariff exemptions. The government monopoly of import of certain items in a certain sector (canalisation) was also reduced by increased domestic production and end of government import monopolies on some items like cement or rubber. By 1987, canalised imports made up just \~25% of all imports, from a high of nearly \~70% in in 1980. A small push to incentivize exports was made with the REP licenses (Replenishment License) which allowed exporters to get a license to import certain restricted goods based on a percentage of their export earnings. These licenses were tradable (and transferable) on a secondary market, which created a big room for corruption and rent-seeking based on arbitrage. The other issue was they were inefficient ways of promoting export earnings and still banned the import of items on the negative list, like electronics.

Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, discusses how difficult it used to be import a computer in those days.

*There was also such a strict licensing regime to import a computer that it took me three years and I went about 50 times to Delhi. Those days I couldn’t afford a flight, so I took a train. I had to stay in some seedy place near Old Delhi Railway Station. Even that cost money for a fledgling company. For new companies, there was such a heavy tariff because even before you got a licence, 50 visits meant — even if it was $500 a trip (at that time, it was Rs 6 per dollar) — $25,000 spent on a $100,000 computer before you bought it or got a licence. The officers did not know anything about computers. They would quibble about small things. Why do you need 64MB of memory? Go with only 48MB, they would say. Let’s say, if one got a licence after two years of running around, one would discover that the models one got the licence for had become old in the US.*

How can you have a Samsung or Sony when having 1100 items up from 76 on your “Open License List”, 70% tariffs instead of 150%, a 50% tax rate instead of 55% and three years to import one computer is seen as the cornerstone of your “reforms”?

**The 1991 crisis, the surplus labor paradox**

The main issue wasn’t even with the lethargic speed of reforms, it was at the rate at which India had racked up foreign debt without any growth in exports. Readers will remember from our last article that in a very similar situation around the same time in the 80s, Chen Yun, one of the eight elders of the CCP at the time, and the strongest ‘fiscal hawk’ had said:

*Some people make fun of cautious people, making it seem as if cautious people believe that the less steel we produce the better. Ridiculous. Yes, we should borrow funds and technology from abroad. But how much can we be sure that we can repay from our People’s Bank? We need to ensure that we will be able to make the repayments.*

*How much time have we wasted since the Opium Wars? 100 years? What is 3 more?*

Unlike in China, there were no large scale land reforms in India during Gandhi’s tenure either, and no changes in the labor laws of the time. In fact, these issues would prove so politically charged and dangerous that the 1980s and 1990s would see no reforms in land/labor, with all leadership choosing to sidestep the contentious agrarian issue and focusing on high-tech IT reforms. India’s land and labor reforms stagnated post-Nehru due to entrenched elites, institutional inertia, and political survival calculus. While China pursued relentless state-led reforms (e.g., Deng’s SEZs, Zhu’s SOE restructuring), India’s democracy prioritized short-term stability over structural change. The 1980s and 1991 reforms sidestepped these issues, leaving a legacy of still-birth. IT reforms were easier to carry out because it was a novel industry that was not linked to the political futures of elected representatives, and this is one place where we warrant the criticism of how Indian democracy has stymied India’s potential. However, the fact of the matter remains that the other governments did not even carry out the changes which could have been done (infrastructure investment, health and education, judicious borrowing). India’s democractic structure is an inevitable reality of it’s diverse and heterogeneous character, but India was also mired by extremely poor leadership at the center for most of the 20^(th) century.

To give an example of how restrictive some of these laws were, the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947 required *private firms* with \>100 employees to seek government approval to fire anyone, and since this approval was rarely granted, it was impossible for promoters to scale their companies without the fear of being stuck with a permanent “hire but never fire” system where job security was nearly certain for any worker. Later amendments in 1976 and 1982 even lowered this 100 employee limit to 50 (a limit that still stands) and private firms as a result simply stopped having permanent employees, instead choosing to rely on contractual labor that was poorly trained and ironically, even more exploited due to a total lack of job security. The other main problem this causes in India is the lack of scalability in industry, there can never be an exponential multiplication of manufacturing power and wealth generated from exports in India because 50% of Indian SMEs (producing just 4% of output) fail to even graduate past the 10 employee stage. In fact, it wasn’t until 2020 with the Four Labor Code reforms that any government even managed to change the laws significantly for the good. The Modi government tried to in 2015 and in 2019, only to get the jibe of “*suit boot ki sarkaar*” (government of the elite) both times by the opposition and millions of people striking out in the open to bring a halt to government until the proposed labor codes were pulled back. Another main problem was Rajiv Gandhi’s government had a historic mandate of 414 seats, with absolutely zero opposition on ground and a ripe environment to carry out reforms, but back-to-back political debacles made him scale back on any reforms and return to a socialist shell.

The Bofors scandal in 1987, involving kickbacks from a ₹1,437 crore Swedish arms deal, irreparably damaged Rajiv Gandhi’s reformist credibility, casting his tech-focused liberalization as elite-driven crony capitalism. This crisis triggered a socialist backlash within Congress, where traditionalists like Arjun Singh accused reforms of betraying Nehru’s "pro-poor" legacy. Finance Minister V.P. Singh, a key reform architect, resigned in 1987, condemning corruption and forming the Janata Dal to mobilize rural voters against "foreign capital appeasement." Opposition leaders like Devi Lal weaponized Nehruvian rhetoric, framing reforms as a "sell-out" to multinationals, forcing Rajiv to abandon deregulation and revive subsidies (e.g., ₹2,500 crore fertilizer subsidies in 1988–89) to placate rural bases. The scandal and ideological infighting derailed India’s reform momentum for a decade, exposing how elite-driven modernization falters without political coalitions to absorb backlash.

Gandhi had also faced Hindu backlash in 1985 due to his blatant disregard for the rule of law in the Shah Bano case (*Mohd. Ahmad Khan (The Union) v. Shah Bano Begum).* Rajiv Gandhi carried out a policy of communal appeasement. After the Supreme Court granted alimony to Shah Bano under secular law, Muslim conservatives protested, prompting Rajiv’s government to pass the Muslim Women Act (1986), overturning the verdict and restricting maintenance to the *iddat* period. This perceived capitulation to clerical demands sparked accusations of "Muslim appeasement" and alienated Hindu voters. To counterbalance this, Rajiv’s administration unlocked the Babri Masjid gates in 1986 via a judicial order, legitimizing Hindu claims to the site and fueling the BJP’s *Ram Janmabhoomi* movement. This tactical pivot to Hindu appeasement backfired, magnifying communal polarization and empowering the BJP’s narrative of "pseudo-secularism." The BJP, leveraging Ayodhya as a rallying cry, surged from 2 seats (1984) to 85 (1989), setting the stage for its eventual dominance in the late 2010s and 2020s.

India's rigid labor laws created structural barriers that stifled labor-intensive sectors like textiles and apparel. Firms were encouraged on their own to seek contractual labor, avoid scaling up in size, and had no incentive to export outside India. Despite our vast labor surplus (just like China), firms preferred capital-heavy industries (e.g., automobiles, machinery) and not labor-intensive ones (textile). This misalignment eroded competitiveness in labor-driven sectors: textile exports plummeted from 25% of global trade in 1947 to 4% by 1990, as Bangladesh and China captured markets with flexible labor policies and cost efficiencies. Meanwhile, India’s manufacturing workforce fragmented into the informal sector, which housed 93% of workers by 1995. These informal enterprises, averaging just 2.3 workers per firm, operated with minimal productivity gains, lacking access to technology, training, or economies of scale, a stark contrast to China’s factories averaging 15+ workers with streamlined operations. China’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which waived labor restrictions and offered tax incentives, attracted massive FDI (e.g., Foxconn’s Shenzhen factories employed 500,000 workers under flexible contracts by 1995). India, by contrast, averaged just $200 million annually in FDI (1985–1995) versus China’s $38 billion, as bureaucratic red tape and labor rigidity deterred investors. This divergence locked India into a low-productivity informal economy that it has not been able to get out of yet while China leveraged labor flexibility and state-backed industrialization to dominate global manufacturing.

The crisis of 1991 arose after external debt obligations became impossible to manage again, with more than 30% of export earnings going to interest payments and external debt at an all time high of \~$85 billion (tripled from 1980). India was also on the losing side of two historic events: the USSR had collapsed in 1991 and the Gulf War just broke out, oil prices went through the roof and India lost it’s largest trading partner (\~30% of all exports), and biggest source of rupee-convertible trade. The Rupee-Ruble trade mechanism (1953-1991) allowed India to conserve it’s dollars since the Soviets accepted rupees for ⅕ of the total trade, letting India acquire oil without having to waste foreign exchange it simply couldn’t earn on it’s own. The collapse of this mechanism hit Indian trade hard, and imports from ex-Soviet states dropped by 65% with the trade deficit being \~3.5% of GDP in 1991 and the fiscal deficit \~10% of GDP. Ironically, the Modi government brought back Rupee-Ruble trade in 2022 with the Ukraine War, letting India buy Russian oil in Rupees at a discount and then sell it back to the West to earn more valuable currency like Euros.

In March of 1991, India’s reserves were in free-fall and the Chandrashekhar Azad government was forced to pledge and airlift 67 tonnes of gold from India to England to secure an emergency loan of $600 million. Such a move was borne out of pure desperation, given the emotional attachment the country had to gold, it was almost a testament to the fact that the country was broke, and just like a struggling Indian household, it was in such dire times it had to sell it’s gold to survive. By June of 1991, foreign exchange reserves had fallen to a paltry \~$1.2 billion, enough for just three weeks of imports and the new government under PM Narasimhan Rao and FM Manmomhan Singh Kohli was forced to do something to get out of the mess given to them once again. Facing a severe balance-of-payments crisis in 1991, India again went to the IMF to seek a bail-out, just like it had in 1981, but this time it faced hostile opposition from all fronts. The IMF and the US refused to assist India until it agreed to carry out a series of reforms that finally dismantled the License Raj once and for all, and India became open to free-trade. The reforms were focused on trade liberalization and deregulation, not necessarily on boosting manufacturing export-led growth (the ‘Washington Consensus’ of the IMF and World Bank emphasized free-trade and free-markets as the key to prosperity), in fact they forced India to abolish any export-related subsidies in place (like the REP licenses) and they did not come with conditions attached to land, labor reforms, so the government could entirely skip out on those reforms. India managed to secure $2.2 billion under a strict conditional plan of bringing down the fiscal deficit and ending the high-tariff regime.

During the reforms, Rao and Kohli had to overcome fierce opposition within their own Congress party. Senior leaders like Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar opposed privatization as a betrayal of Nehruvian socialism, while MPs decried fuel price hikes (40% for LPG, 30% for fertilizers) as "anti-poor." As detailed in *Half Lion* by Vinay Sitapati, Rao navigated resistance by retaining control of the Industry Ministry to directly oversee deregulation, rebranding reforms as a "return to Nehru’s vision" to placate critics. Key measures included a 24% rupee devaluation (July 1991), abolition of the License Raj in July 1991, and partial currency convertibility by 1993, abolishing capital controls. In the financial sector, the Narasimham Committee’s recommendations drove key changes: statutory liquidity (SLR) and cash reserve ratios (CRR) were slashed from 38.5% and 25% to 25% and 10%, respectively, freeing up capital for lending. Interest rates, previously controlled by the RBI, were gradually deregulated, starting with long-term deposits to encourage savings. Public and private banks faced new competition from foreign players, supported by relaxed branch licensing and operational autonomy. Simultaneously, capital markets were restructured and SEBI gained statutory powers to regulate transparency, replacing direct government control with investor-focused oversight. These steps aimed to modernize a rigid banking system and attract domestic and foreign investment through competitive, market-driven practices.

On the industrial and trade fronts, licensing requirements were scrapped for all but 18 strategic sectors, dismantling the License Raj. The MRTP Act, which stifled private expansion, was repealed, while public sector dominance shrank from 17 reserved areas to 8 (like railways and atomic energy). Trade barriers were dismantled and imports shifted from a restrictive “positive list” to a limited “negative list,” slashing tariffs from over 300% to 50%. FDI rules eased, allowing automatic approval for up to 51% foreign equity in priority sectors, later raised to 100%. The rupee’s 20% devaluation in July 1991 aimed to boost export competitiveness amid a balance-of-payments crisis. These measures, coupled with the creation of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), marked the end of economic protectionism in India to a significant extent, but were half-baked because they refused to address deep-rooted structural issues in land, agriculture, labor and manufacturing.

**Post-Reforms, the ‘Back office of the World’, and Modi-led infra push**

The reforms finally secured the a $2.2 billion IMF bailout and $1.8 billion in World Bank loans, alongside the desperate airlift of 67 tonnes of gold done very clandestinally to secure $600 million. By 1994, GDP growth surged to 7.6%, and forex reserves rose from $1.2 billion (1991) to $20 billion (1995), stabilizing the once distraught situation. The rest of the 1990s and the 2000s would see the rise of services-led growth in India for more than two decades, without any major changes in the underlying structure of the country (IT, Telecom and Finance attract 60% of all FDI inflows and India’s IT services exports went from $150 million in 1991 to $190 billion in 2021. The magic word we heard in India growing up those times was “FDI”, it was this foreign investment that was supposed to make India as rich as China, replicating the Han miracle. FDI or Foreign Direct Investment is really important because it lets multinational companies from advanced companies invest directly into your country (providing an infusion of foreign capital, at no interest cost) and train your workforce in modern technologies and efficient systems of production. Foreign Investment is not a loan, so it does not come with interest payments or default risks, and it also brings the company investing in you as a direct partner that is obligated to increase the value of it’s investment by transferring knowledge and technology to you.

In India, FDI has risen to \~$80 billion by 2020, and when big names like Amazon or Suzuki (Maruti) invest in India and open factories or offices, they help train employees to world-class standards and the resulting ToT improves Indian capacities in those sectors. Indian growth was always fueled by domestic consumption (making up 70% of our GDP) and services export (which benefited tremendously from FDI). Indian car manufacturers with foreign partnerships like Maruti haven’t really managed to expand to become a global car company like BYD has in China, so the FDI-led growth has been services led growth (55% of Indian GDP comes from the service sector). From 1991 to 2000, India had a modest GDP growth rate of 5% pa, which went up to 8% pa from 2001 to 2011, and slowed down for an average of 6-6.5% from 2012-2024. In contrast, China grew at 10% straight from 1991-2011 and and growth slowed down post 2011 due to the overleveraged nature of the domestic economy, falling consumption, trade wars, coronavirus and a property-sector crisis.

Another big hurdle to manufacturing investment in India is the problem faced with respect to land acquisition due to local and political malcontent. Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory was built in 10 months, while in India, the Korean steel giant POSCO was forced to stay in legal limbo for 15 years while tribal and environmental groups in Orissa halted the process of land acquisition. The $12 billion planned plant at Jagatsinghpur was finally scrapped after POSCO backed out from the venture. In other examples, the Shiv Sena-led (Thackeray) MVA government dismissed the Mumbai-Ahemdabad High Speed Rail project as a "vanity initiative," stalling approvals in bodies like the Thane Municipal Corporation and delaying forest clearances for 32 hectares. Land acquisition lagged at just 22% (vs. Gujarat’s 85%), with protests from farmers and tribal communities in Palghar/Dahanu over livelihood losses and environmental lawsuits. Administrative hurdles included delayed land transfers and Maharashtra withholding its ₹5,000 crore equity share. However, after the Eknath Shinde-BJP coalition took power in June 2022, land acquisition surged to 98.22%, forest approvals were fast-tracked, and tenders for Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex station resumed. As of 2025, 100% of the land acquisition for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR is complete, with 81% of the project being funded by an interest-free loan from Japan to the MH government.

As a result, Manufacturing as a percent of GDP has stayed at a constant 15% from 2000-2020 (slightly up to 17% in 2020) and a phenomenon referred to as ‘Premature Deindustrialization’ by Dani Rodrik has set in, where emerging markets are becoming full service economies before going through the full cycle of industrialization. Developing countries, including India, are experiencing a decline in manufacturing employment and output at much lower income levels compared to early industrializers like the U.S. and Europe. This trend, driven by globalization, labor-saving technologies, and competition from manufacturing giants like China, has forced many developing nations to shift prematurely toward service economies without fully reaping the productivity gains of industrialization. In India, this has resulted in a limited manufacturing base, with urban workers moving into low-productivity services rather than factories. Manufacturing share of output and incomes peaks and then begins to decline at the country attains middle income levels. India has started deindustrializing at a per capita income $2000 while Western countries began the same transition at a per capita income of $10,000. India sees 12 million people enter it’s workforce every year, and it simply does not have enough service sector skill intensive jobs to employ all of them.

Bad debt (thankfully, internal debt this time) would become a thing once again in the mid 2010s, leading to a NPA (bad loan) crisis in Indian public sector banks due to corruption and inefficiency that would not get fixed for a decade. NPAs had surged during the UPA era, peaking at ₹8.95 lakh crore in FY18, with systemic issues such as aggressive lending, political interference, and corruption leading to stressed assets. The government implemented measures like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which enabled faster resolution of bad loans, recovering over ₹10 lakh crore between 2014 and 2023. Recapitalization efforts infused ₹3.1 lakh crore into PSBs between 2016 and 2021, strengthening their balance sheets. Reforms included improving governance, adopting technology, and merging weaker banks to create stronger entities. As a result, the gross NPA ratio of PSBs declined **from a peak of 14.58% in March 2018 to 3.12% by September 2024**, while profits soared to over ₹3 lakh crore annually.

The other major reforms that the Modi government has carried out since then were a massive investment in basic infrastructure: complete electrification, toilet construction and expansion of the highway network. It is bewildering how despite 60 years of governance, India had not even achieved full electrification of it’s villages by 2014. Through initiatives like the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Saubhagya Yojana, all 18,374 un-electrified villages were electrified by 2018, with over 2.86 crore households gaining access to electricity. The average daily electricity supply in rural areas increased from 12.5 hours in 2014 to 22.6 hours in 2025, while urban areas now enjoy 23.4 hours of power daily, ensuring minimal disruptions for industries. Simultaneously, the government tackled sanitation challenges through the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, building over 110 million toilets and achieving open defecation-free status by 2020, benefiting over 600 million people. Enhanced power generation capacity **(up by 79.5% since 2014)** and expanded transmission networks have reduced energy shortages from 4.2% in 2014 to a mere 0.1% in 2025, ensuring reliable power for industrial growth without interruptions.

The National Highway network expanded by 60%, **from 91,287 km in 2014 to 1,46,145 km in 2023**, with highway construction reaching a record pace of 37 km/day. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has completed 15,549 km of highways under Phase I, while rural connectivity improved with 3.74 lakh km of roads built under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Railways have seen modernization through 100+ Vande Bharat trains, electrification of 93.83% of broad-gauge tracks, and the redevelopment of 1,318 stations under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme. Urban mobility has been transformed with metro rail expansion from 248 km in 2014 to 945 km in 2024, now serving 21 cities. In aviation, the UDAN Scheme operationalized 545 routes and added 84 airports in the last decade. Additionally, initiatives like the Sagarmala Programme and National Waterways Act have enhanced port-led development and inland water transport.

Then there is the creation of the digital ‘India Stack’, a digital public infrastructure comprising Aadhaar (biometric identity), UPI (real-time payments), and mobile connectivity. Aadhaar, covering over 1.4 billion people, ensures secure identification for welfare distribution, while UPI, launched in 2016, has become the backbone of digital payments, processing over 10 billion monthly transactions by 2024. The JAM trinity (Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar, and Mobile phones) has facilitated Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), eliminating middlemen and saving ₹3.5 trillion in leakages since 2014. Welfare schemes like PM-Kisan and LPG subsidies are now directly credited to beneficiaries’ accounts. The digital push was further accelerated by Reliance Jio’s entry in 2016, which slashed data costs by over 90%, making high-speed internet accessible to millions. This democratization of connectivity enabled rural Indians to access online banking, education, and telemedicine. With minimal infrastructure costs, small vendors now accept digital payments via QR codes, integrating them into the formal economy

The government has also focused on a core export-linked incentives scheme to boost manufacturing in India, the PLI (production linked incentives) scheme launched in 2020 has been a transformative initiative to boost domestic manufacturing, attract foreign investment, and reduce import dependency across 14 critical sectors. With an outlay of ₹1.97 lakh crore, the scheme incentivizes companies to scale production by offering financial rewards based on incremental output. The electronics sector has been a standout success, with India transitioning from a net importer of mobile phones to a global exporter. Companies like Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron, key suppliers for Apple, have established manufacturing units in India, contributing to smartphone exports worth ₹80,769 crore as of 2022. The scheme has also expanded into sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and telecom, fostering innovation and creating over 8.5 lakh jobs. For instance, the PLI for telecom equipment has achieved 60% import substitution, while the food processing PLI has enhanced farmers' incomes by promoting domestic sourcing.

**Conclusion**

Despite all these success stories, real GDP growth has not been more than \~6.5-7% per annum, and one of the most important reasons for that is the slowdown in global growth. It’s much easier to grow at 10% when global growth is at 5% and much more difficult to do the same when the entire world has slowed down. Export-led growth works the best when the advanced economies purchasing from India have a consumptionary environment with low interest rates and low inflation, leading to more discretionary spending power to buy goods from countries like India. The peak of global growth from 1980-2008 was fueled in large part by taking on a lot of public debt, which eventually has to be paid back, and when advanced economies are paying back debt they do not have the same fiscal environment that is conducive for a very export-led growth model for emerging economies. There is a lot less money to go around for everyone, and hence not every country can hope to become the next China by capturing global markets.

The main ideas to take from this article have been the fact that economic reform in India, whether in the 1980s or in the 1990s, was something the state was forced to do to merely survive, unlike in the East Asian tigers that purused a comprehensive policy of industrial reform to become developed economies. In the 1970s, global oil shocks and a decade of stagflation in the West forced India to borrow from the IMF, and Indira/Rajiv Gandhi carried out a small series of changes to License Raj along with pursuing a debt-driven growth model. Rajiv Gandhi’s political scandals made him dial down the reforms and he retreated back to his socialist shell to seek political reelection. Foreign borrowing did not end and by 1990 the country was spending 30% of it’s export earnings on servicing interest payments. This external debt built up to such a large amount that the 1991 collapse of the USSR and the Gulf War brought the country down to its knees again, forcing it to finally end the tariff rule once and for all. In India, reform in crucial sectors (land, agriculture, labor) could not be completed due to political problems, and investment in infrastructure was very limited until 2014 onwards. Narasimhan Rao’s government succeeded in ending the License Raj but did not bother tinkering with politically more sensitive reforms, or with a capex push to modernize India’s infrastructure. The hyperfocus on formal sector reforms and lack of trade barriers led to a bustling IT exports sector that did not have the same interest groups demanding regulation of it, and hence India used it’s large English-speaking population to become the back-office of the world, with the idea of a call center becoming synonymous with the country.

Manufacturing as a percent of GDP stagnated at 15% for 20 years and people mistakenly assumed that the high-growth environment of the 2000s would last forever. The 2008 financial crisis and the rising NPA crisis in Indian banking put an end to the era of constant 8% growth in the Indian economy, with advanced economies heavily leveraged already and dealing with high inflation post-COVID, the global environment for growth looks bleak at the moment, and China’s bull run from 1990-2010 does not really seem replicable, even for countries like Vietnam which offer promise as the next big manufacturing hub. Structural reforms in the Indian economy only started again post 2014, with the Modi government using its electoral mandates to push for reforms in labour codes, in agriculture and in manufacturing. Rapid infrastructural development and the creation of a digital ‘India Stack’ has helped resolve a lot of the fundamental issues holding back growth in India, and the fruits of these reforms will be apparent if India continues to maintain a growth rate of around 7% in the near future.

However, these post-2014 reforms under the Modi government, while ambitious, have faced their own set of challenges, including widespread protests over agricultural laws and uneven implementation of labor code changes, reflecting the persistent political complexities that have historically hindered India's economic transformation. India also continues to grapple with persistent challenges in human capital development that have lingered for over two decades, alongside a lack of significant progress in bolstering research and development (R&D). India’s performance in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)—the only year it participated—highlighted severe deficiencies in educational outcomes. Indian students, sampled from Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, scored an average of 336 in reading, 337 in mathematics, and 337 in science, placing the country second-to-last among 74 participating nations and regions, only ahead of Kyrgyzstan. These scores were well below the OECD average of approximately 493 in reading, 496 in mathematics, and 501 in science, underscoring a significant gap in foundational skills among 15-year-olds. This poor performance reflects systemic issues such as inadequate school infrastructure, teacher shortages, and a rote-learning-focused curriculum, which have not seen transformative improvement since. Meanwhile, on the R&D front, India’s investment has remained stubbornly stagnant, hovering around 0.6–0.7% of GDP for years. For instance, according to World Bank data, R&D expenditure was 0.74% of GDP in 2000 and barely increased to 0.64% by 2020, a stark contrast to countries like China (2.41% in 2020) or South Korea (4.81% in 2020), which have prioritized investments in human capital and R&D. The government has not significantly ramped up its investment in R&D, with gross expenditure in this area failing to breach the 1% of GDP threshold long targeted in policy rhetoric, limiting India’s capacity to develop cutting-edge technologies and a skilled, innovation-ready workforce. Together, these shortcomings in human capital and R&D investment constrain India’s ability to shift from a services-dominated economy to a more balanced, industrialized powerhouse.

The push for manufacturing through initiatives like "Make in India" aims to boost the sector's share of GDP, but it contends with global supply chain shifts and competition from more agile economies like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Infrastructure investment has indeed accelerated since 2014, with projects like highways, ports, and digital connectivity receiving significant attention, yet the pace of modernization still struggles to keep up with the demands of a rapidly growing population and an increasingly urbanized workforce. India’s IT-driven growth, while a success story, has not been complemented by a similar revolution in manufacturing or agriculture, leaving the economy overly reliant on services in an era where global demand is volatile. As the world grapples with post-COVID economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, India’s ability to sustain and deepen these structural reforms will determine whether it can finally break free from its legacy of reactive, survival-driven economic policies and chart a proactive path toward becoming a developed industrial power.
